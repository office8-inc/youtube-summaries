## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

If I wanted to maximize my short-term money, I would definitely go all in on info products because that was like a clear path for me to scale to like 200 300k a month. The realistic answer is that the next 5 to 7 years minimum is going to be human plus agents working together. Everything is going to be basically usage based as the economy is more effective. People say like, "Oh, I would never put something into my brain." Well, guess what? Like people who put something into their brain is going to be 10,000 times more productive, right?

### 📋 背景・概要

My prediction would be that we see tons of progress, but it's going to be in less domains until there is some new breakthrough. I think nobody knows what will happen once AGI and Singularity is here, but I felt like a right directional bet would be becoming as good as possible at AI. My name is David Andre. I'm an entrepreneur from Czech Republic and I'm the founder of vectal.ai and I'm also known for my YouTube channel, David Andre. >> All right, David, it's incredible to have you here.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

been hearing so much about your various world travels and uh you're just absolutely killing it and just wanted to know a little bit more about it, find out a little bit more about you. Um to people that are not familiar, I mean you started at first just doing YouTube videos, then all of a sudden I see you with >> Mr. Hermosi uh Alex Hermoszi, right? Uh flying over to Vegas, you started in Czech Republic. Now you're all over the world, Dubai, Czech Republic.

### 📝 詳細説明

I guess you were in Vegas briefly. So >> tell us a little bit about like where did you start and how did you do all the insane stuff that you're doing now? >> So how far back do you want to go? Do you want to go to like my first business or even further back? >> Let's mainly focus on this.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I'd love to hear the the backstory, but let's Yeah. Yeah. Let's start with the with the AI. >> Yeah. So I was doing YouTube before AI and then in like when CHBD came out, that was really the moment actually.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I had a friend that was interested in neural networks in like probably 2020, so before Chad GBD, but it didn't really occur to me how big it is. I remember watching a video when GPD3 came out, which I guess was like summer of 2020 in the API and I was like, "Oh, this is cool." But it didn't really connect the dots for me that this is going to be huge. But after she had GBD kind of, everybody understood like this is going to be world changing technology. And every single day, I legit kept thinking like I need to be an AI. So I was doing like gaming content.

### 🎯 応用例

I had a different YouTube channel. I was, but I was like, I need to be an AI. I cannot just be like using it. I need to be in it. I need to be doing it every day.

### 💭 考察

And then in April of 2023, I made the decision. I actually took a week off. I flew to Denmark to Copenhagen. Didn't work for a week. I did like a think week.

### 📌 まとめ

And I I was like, listen, I I sooner or later I'll have to do the switch. So, I just dropped everything. And I was at that time I was like 20 years old and I was making around $20,000 a month from the gaming channel. and my income went basically to like from 20K to like $600 a month. So my income completely plummeted after switching to AI.

### ✅ 結論

But uh obviously in hindsight it was the right move and I just knew like I had to be in the industry. So yeah, April 2023 is first when I fully committed and started uploading on my David channel. >> Absolutely. Um and then uh go ahead Dylan. >> No.

### 📚 追加情報

>> Oh sorry. As I thought you had a question. Yeah, it was incredible watching you because dude you move so fast. I mean with the AI channel all of a sudden you're on school just like dominating the leaderboards. Oh, I I see your face on Alex Herozy's channel.

### 🔖 補足

Tell us a little bit about that. Why did you decide to I mean start a course is is pretty obvious, but like tell us a little bit more about Alex Hermoszi and how did you decide to go that route? Yeah, I mean I've been watching Hermosi for a while, like since he had like probably like 50,000 subscribers and uh in when he made the school acquisition, he announced it on first on Instagram and then it was like January 2023 and that was before the f first school games. So I was like, okay, this is my opportunity because for the first 10 months of my YouTube channel, I didn't have any product and I didn't do any brand deals. So, I was literally only living off by YouTube AdSense, which is again was like fluctuating between $600 a month and $1,000 a month, which really is not that not enough to live on.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, I was living for my savings basically. And u that was like I was like, okay, that could be a product. Back then, nobody did AI communities like now. I feel everybody has one, but I was like, okay, this is interesting platform. It kind of simplifies everything.

### 🚀 セクション 14

It also like tells you what the delivery would be, you know, community with the classroom. There's some tutorials, some workshops, plus some weekly calls. So they kind of tell you what you should do as a creator and that that was huge, you know, they they simplified it a lot and I was like, "Okay, I want to compete in the school games." The first month I didn't win, but I was like, "Okay, I'm going to keep going. I'm going keep scaling." And the second month I managed to land in the top 10 and that was, you know, the Vegas event in the next month. >> Oh man, that's absolutely absolutely incredible.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So for people that don't know the school game, so school, uh, it's I think Alex Hermosi either started or he invested, I think, and he came in there and he started Yeah. And it's uh basically a place for people to start community communities slashcourses kind of like an educational environment. And basically the people that have the most sort of momentum as they're starting up climb the leaderboards in this kind of behindthe-scenes um you know creator sort of classroom that everybody shares and has these masterminds where they talk about what they're doing. And uh this guy comes out of nowhere just like just rockets to the top which was just absolutely incredible to see. >> Um so so that happens.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Uh I feel like at this point most people have been like all right like overwhelming success. I'm done. I got to slow down. You don't stop. You launch a a freaking startup.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Like tell us >> Yeah. Yeah. >> What are you taking, man? First of all, >> well I don't know. Like in my head, I guess my brain doesn't work like that.

### 📋 セクション 18

Like I don't think I've been over successful even at my age. Like for example, you know, the other day I've seen an interview with the CEO of Meror, which is like a a AI data labeling um company and he's like 22 and they're doing 500 million a year. So they're valued at 10 billion and he's 22. So like you know treadmill. >> Yeah.

### ⭐ セクション 19

I feel like in life it's important to comp it's important what people you compare yourself to, right? Like if you always look at the guy on the street and it's like, "Oh, I'm doing better than the average guy. I'm in better shape than the average guy." You don't want to like compare yourself to the average person, right? You want to compare yourself people who doing better than you ideally. So even after like winning the school games, I didn't see myself as successful at all.

### 📝 セクション 20

Like it's just I don't know my brain doesn't work like that. I I don't see like oh now let's celebrate, you know? I always look at the next thing and just I I see it more as a one continuous process. So I started the startup in um well it's hard to point pinpoint when I started because I the first 30 days I just spent brainstorming ideas and like what are different problems in that AI could be used for and after 30 days I I chose the one that I thought had the most belief and you know that that's ended up being vectal and then three and a half months I was building it myself until I hired some devs. Uh but I guess the I started working on it probably like late October of 2024.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, gotcha. >> Can you can you break down that three months a bit more? Like what were some of the ideas that you threw away, but even more important like what is the process you're using to figure out where AI fits into the future? >> Well, I I wouldn't claim I have it figured out, you know, like um I would say like maybe once we're at like 100k MR, maybe then I can say we figured it out or something. Maybe at that point I'll still feel like we didn't.

### 🔧 セクション 22

But basically for for the first 30 days I just uh brainstormed different problems and then solutions to them. So I printed some like software software related problems that I have and also like did the research on what my audience has some issues issues like just general like trying to think where AI is useful where it's good at what it's bad at and trying to brainstorm as many startup ideas because before committing to something I guess it depends like a lot of people just want to do a startup to make some quick money and like you know sell it or something like that but I knew this is going to be like a long-term play right maybe like a 10-year play and I didn't do it with the goal of selling it so That's why I spent the 30 days of trying to brainstorm as many ideas possible and then chose what I thought was the best one at the end of 30 days. And then the decision to build it myself actually that is a very interesting decision because a lot of people in my position and on my at my income would have just paid someone to build it for me especially like given how busy I was at that time. But I knew that I wouldn't have a good decision- making on whether the engineers are doing a good job and whether the developers are taking too long if I didn't have the technical skills. So I knew that even if it takes longer to start, I have to build it myself.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Obviously with AI, so you know. >> Yeah, definitely makes sense. So Veal AI, what is it? What does it do? Just for people that maybe not familiar with it.

### 💭 セクション 24

>> Yeah, it's a task management AI powered task management tool. So you can think of it as like something between notion, chat GBT, and anything. We have some automations, we have all the main task management tools, and we have a powerful AI agent with all of the models. >> Gotcha. So, where where you're from, there's a little bit of a I mean, I I I know at least a few people in the AI space that are part of like the in the YouTube space that are part of the AI.

### 📌 セクション 25

Um, there's one person you you did a few collabs with. I think he's also in the Czech Republic. Uh, kind of also young guy. I'm blanking on the name, but I mean, were you kind of part of a tech community or this was just completely learning online, talking to people online? >> Definitely learning online.

### ✅ セクション 26

I mean this wasn't like part of any accelerator or any community. I'm completely bootstrapped. I own 100%. Um yeah, it was my decision and it it was like after thinking of like okay, do I want to do like high ticket courses? Do I want to do coaching?

### 📚 セクション 27

I was like I tried it a bit and I I had pretty good success like doing coaching for I think in my first week I sold like three people for like 8,000 coaching and it it was usually people who already had like were in my community for a long time and you know trusted my channel and I these were like action takers so I knew they would be successful but I just like I didn't like it so I just refunded all of them and went all in on building a startup but my path was like if I wanted to maximize my short-term money I would definitely go all in on info products. because that was like a clear path for me to scale to like 200 300k a month. But I just didn't like it and I I wasn't feeling inspired by the vision. But like building software for me that was something I knew I could do 10 hours a day. Yeah.

### 🔖 セクション 28

I mean I had kind of a a similar experience because initially I thought oh I I I tried to launch a couple different communities. I tried a free one at first. That was a little bit of a nightmare just because you can't really quality control free communities because Yeah. >> Um >> I started for free by the way. you oh you started uh for free in initially.

### 🎨 セクション 29

>> Yeah. Yeah. My my community was free for the first three weeks but the quality of post was so bad and like whatever yeah what would you describe as the same experience I had. So then I switched it to 37 a month and that was like the first time I made money basically outside of AdSense from this YouTube channel and u yeah that really was a great decision because the moment you start charging like the level of people just goes up drastically. Yeah, people invest money and they kind of they feel like they've invested money, they tend to for whatever reason just just better conversations, better investment in the community, everything else.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And uh yeah, I mean I I so info products I think people that want short shortterm cash, it's a great way, but it's just not I don't know if if I redo it, I might I'm going to have to really think about exactly how I'm going to approach it because it just doesn't seem like I like what you're doing by building a product that's for the long term. uh you know collecting users. Um so you said you haven't cracked 100,000 monthly run rate uh revenue recurring revenue but you got to be up there. You have whatif 50,000 users or tell us a little bit about that. >> Yeah so in terms of like total users we had I think over 60,000 maybe 65,000 not monthly active like total total that use the product.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Uh in terms of like uh MR we're at I think 11.3K. So, you know, the growth is slower than I would like, but we're we're growing. So, I I guess I cannot complain too much, >> dude. I mean, the fact that you went I mean, so for people that maybe just not aware, like you were making a lot more with school. So, the fact that you you're almost like sacrificing short-term money.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And keep in mind, this guy isn't from a rich family. This guy wasn't born, what is it, the expression, silver spoon in his mouth. These are from a a small village in in the Czech Republic. So to turn down huge sums of money for for long-term gain, but meaning like you you provide long-term value for long-term gain. I mean, that's a that's a beautiful thing, dude.

### 🎬 セクション 33

I I think you're on the right track. Uh how the heck did you manage to have Balaji on the channel? That was pretty incredible. I mean, uh he seems like a very interesting person to talk to. >> I mean, we're just doing insane amount of reachouts.

### 📋 セクション 34

really to get the people that successfully you just have to like reach out and follow up and follow up and follow up. So we're we're doing quite a bit of volume on that and I think u also with people like that some of them uh actually follow me which is you know quite shocking when I check it and see like follows you but I think it's because uh you know again this is why I switched to AI because I understood like people who who are important in this world like they will always want to talk to somebody who on the cutting edge right and it wasn't like a financial switch switching to AI it was more like this is something that matters a lot I I want to make sure I'm at the cutting edge of I don't know like nobody knows what will happen once AGI and Singularity is here but I felt like a right directional bet would be becoming as good as possible at AI you know trying to be on the cutting edge I felt like that just cannot go wrong I didn't have all the answers I didn't know I I'm going to start a startup I just knew that learning about this and trying to you know make connections is is the right move so what's the what do you think of when you think about how a future has the opportunity to pay for intelligence I mean there should in all aspects of what you're doing, some kind of AI soon that does everything better. Um, how are you kind of delegating or planning to delegate as intelligence becomes more ubiquitous and cheap? So, I think people overexaggerate either that AGI will, you know, replace all jobs or they overexaggerate that AI is not that useful and it's just predicting the next token and stuff like that. I think the realistic answer is that the next five to seven years minimum is going to be human plus agents working together.

### ⭐ セクション 35

The agents are going to do the repetitive processes that are kind of safe and you know you can think of it as a company of SOPs. If you can hire an intern and you have a good SOP, you know, standard operating procedure and you can give it to that intern and he can do it probably you can do the same with agent, right? For example, McDonald's has really good like templates and franchises. Obviously, it's physical, so it would be more a humanoid robot rather than an AI agent. But they're McDonald's are probably the best in the world at taking like a unskilled human and making him productive very fast.

### 📝 セクション 36

If your company has a lot of these SOPs, templates, playbooks that are just a series of steps that are repetitive and predictable and safe, then you can definitely do that with AI agents. So what humans will do again well it's kind of pointless talking about past singularity because nobody knows what one super intelligence is here but the next five seven years it's very obvious that it will be humans plus agents where the humans are designing different workflows of agents and just like improving them overseeing them and the agents are doing the all the repetitive stuff. Yeah, I mean when when this whole thing started taking off, there was a lot of sort of uh people were guessing how quickly we're going to get to the singularity or a like whatever you want to call it. That sort of point where human innovation, human ingenuity is not going to be as important because we're but you know what it does seem like we have some time. It's not going to be right around the corner.

### 💡 セクション 37

It's not next year. We've got like you said I think you said five to seven years of where humans and agents are working together. And to me that's kind of exciting. we have time to really learn this technology, to use it. It's not like snap your fingers and it's gone.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Um, so I'm extremely excited about the next decade or so. Um, one thing that recently happened, so we're recording this today is September 18th. Uh, yesterday or actually the day before that, Google announces that they're working with Coinbase to create, well, Google is actually building out their own agent marketplace and their own agent payment system. Um, have you looked at at at that at all? Because that seems like a massive shift that's that's happening like as everything gets replaced by these injecting systems, anybody can build them.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Are you looking at that? Are you interested in that at all? I haven't looked at this specific one, but I've seen like headlines around the payments for agents and I think it's definitely going to happen because um microtransactions like everything is going to be basically usage based as the economy is more effective, right? Like if you're paying $200 a month for a plan, but you use it only like 3 days of the month, but you still want what the plan has to offer, it kind of isn't efficient, right? So, I think having micro like the current banking system doesn't work for this.

### 💭 セクション 40

The banking system is very slow. Only works 5 days of the week, certain hours, you know, takes like if you send to a different country, it takes like a week for that transaction to clear. Crypto, like there's much better solutions, right? You you you can look for like uh altcoins, but even just like Bitcoin and the lightning layer, you can send like transactions in a matter of milliseconds and it works 20 24/7, 7 days of the week. No pauses, no approvals for anything.

### 📌 セクション 41

So you can just give like your agent $5 worth of Bitcoin and the agent will just go around the web and if if some site has like this site has propri proprietary data it enters 0.03 to access you know the agent can make that small transaction but you cannot do this with bank you cannot do this with credit card because the fees would eat that even Stripe or PayPal would eat that fees so hard so you cannot do like a 0.03 payment anywhere or even smaller than that you know maybe like 0.003 003, but you can easily do that on the lightning layer with Bitcoin. So, I think agents will have to make their payments very soon. >> Yeah, you know, I don't know, have you dived in dived into microtransactions and how that alone can change the world like even regardless of AI just the fact that we could have such different automated systems working at such low rates without those fees would totally change the economy, makes it so much more liquid. >> Absolutely. I mean, I think like it's kind of crazy we're still using banks.

### ✅ セクション 42

Like we have the technology here, you know, like I'm paying my employees. It takes them multiple days to arrive. Like why why am I getting permission from a bank? Why can't I just send a uh on the blockchain payment and it's like within a seconds nobody no middleman, you know? It's kind of crazy.

### 📚 セクション 43

>> Yeah. And so where do you fall on the idea of the agents actually having control of of decisions and of money? Like do you think uh autonomous agents should be able to get their own bank accounts or would you always want someone like you a human to approve the money and sort of be in control of it? >> I mean depends on the time frame. Like if you're talking about today then you know probably not.

### 🔖 セクション 44

But I like even today I probably wouldn't mind giving an agent like $50 and like you know again like what's the worst that can happen? It can waste the $50. So but if you're talking like 5 years from now I think there will be like protocols. There'll be ways um how you like get a two two authentication notification. Maybe if the transaction is over $10, it needs approval from a human.

### 🎨 セクション 45

I think there'll be ways to figure it out. So I I wouldn't be like scared about giving agents access to money. And I think the human like in terms of decision- making, I think that's the job of the human. I think this is actually one of the most common mistakes people make with AI, whether it is like building their own startup or just in general trying to delegate important decisions to AI. That that's like terrible.

### 🚀 セクション 46

AI is great at you know giving you like the mainstream narrative. So if you want to live an average life that's an excellent strategy but AI is never going to tell you like how to achieve greatness. You have to always stay in charge and like make the decisions have trust your own judgment refine your own taste and if you if there's like a creative idea that's required you need to use your own brain rather than asking AI. So like decision- making that's something I would not outsource to AI. >> Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So, I think you probably did answer my next question with that comment, but just to be sure, like the idea of the agent filing its own taxes and not being responsible for giving you your money back. You're not probably not into that. Just you want to make sure stay Oh, okay. So, you >> because filing taxes is very safe. Like, it's a repeatable process.

### 🌟 セクション 48

There's plenty of information and courses online how to properly file taxes, right? >> So, it's not like a something where they have to pull off a unique trick. Now, it's probably not going to do like some crazy tax loophole, but it would it would file your taxes in a proper standard way. And I think again, like maybe in the first few years, we'll have double checking from humans, but I would gladly replace all of my tax advisors with AI agents happily. Yeah.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And I mean with the with the marketplaces, I mean one of the the the things that Google was giving example of is like if you have an HR agent, somebody that does background checks, you can have tax accountant agents, whatever that'll do stuff on your behalf. It doesn't have to be necessarily that you're doing everything yourself inhouse or build your own kind of bespoke agent, your specific agent for every single thing. You just go on the marketplace and like you said for microp payments, yeah, it could be very very inexpensive. somebody else's agent is doing 10,000 tax returns for something cheap and they guarantee it. If there's a problem, then they're human, their CPA steps in to like check it out or whatever.

### 📋 セクション 50

So, >> that's the answer to be honest. >> Yeah. Um, so I guess the the next best big thing we can talk about is this whole idea of Vibe coding. You know, a lot of people have different opinions on it. Some people are like, "Oh, it's horrible.

### ⭐ セクション 51

It's a joke. It's I mean, a lot of people have a lot of derision towards it." Um, but I mean a lot of people were I mean the new codeex GPT5 codeex skate out came out. I've been messing around with it. Where do you see this whole thing going? Is there a future to vibe coding?

### 📝 セクション 52

>> Well, I mean I would say like I have easily over one like a thousand hours vibe coding cuz since I started building my startup I was building it with AI. Back then it was cloth 3.5 set that was the best model at the time and literally since day one I was using AI to you know advise me on like what text stack should I use and then I checked it okay this makes sense or like you know write the front end like I wasn't a professional developer I want to make that very clear I never built a full stack app before I I knew the basics of programming I did some like um when I was 15 I built like a mobile app with you know just following YouTube tutorials it's a mobile game then when I was like a bit older I did some like Minecraft plugins in Java but I I wasn't like a pro a genius prodigy. I was like quite the opposite. It took me forever to learn the basics. I couldn't understand what variables meant for the longest time.

### 💡 セクション 53

So I knew like fundamentals of programming. But AI wrote basically all the code. So in terms of vibe coding, I was doing it since it was named vibe coding. And I would say right now I see it split into two things. I see like one is like vibe coding where you see like people typing only English with no thought and then I would see like AI programming.

### 🔧 セクション 54

And I think these are becoming completely separate because there is like way more serious software in the AI coding, AI programming side which like people use to actually ship production code. And then VIP coding is like someone who has zero knowledge of what they're doing. Just they just type in in English. Sometimes it doesn't even make sense what they're doing. They don't know any pro engineering, nothing like that.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And they're just like, you know, yoloing it completely. So I think these two are becoming more and more separate. But uh I think there's use in both. Like I I wouldn't say like I wouldn't prevent a non non-programmer to you know build their own website. I think there's a great power in the fact that even like a you know 60-year-old aunt with zero experience can speak English and see a new website.

### 💭 セクション 56

Yeah, absolutely. And I mean I think that's a great way of putting it that you got to think of it as two separate things. One is vibe coding, one is AI programming. And the sort of professional developers, they're going to be doing AI programming, right? They're going to be doing programming, software engineering with the assistance of AI.

### 📌 セクション 57

But guess what? Any >> the kids now can start building apps. People that have no technical background can start building apps. So it sounds like you built your first prototype for your company that's doing very well now basically by yourself with quote unquote vibe coding. So you went from zero to one.

### ✅ セクション 58

You got your first users on board without a professional developer hired. >> Would that have been possible 5 years ago? Well, it would have, but it would take way longer. So, like, you know, in I when I was uh 15, like before my first business, I I did the mobile app. It didn't make any money.

### 📚 セクション 59

So, that's why I don't call it my first business. But that took me like 10 months to just like learn the basics, watch tutorials, like debug it, Google everything. Every bug took forever to fix and test out. >> So, that was before AI. So, I knew what it was like coding before AI and it's like way slower.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So yeah like vectal took me 2 months from first line of code to launched. It probably would have taken like minimum 6 to 8 months without AI minimum. So it would have be possible but just like way longer. Yeah that's absolutely incredible. I think people are sleeping on this.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Um they have their sort of pre-existing ideas but the world is changing. They people don't understand this idea like going from zero to one used to be hard. >> Yeah. uh and slow. Now it's fast and I don't want to say easy, but man, it's it's a lot more possible.

### 🚀 セクション 62

>> Yeah. But you can actually build something to get feedback from when they talk about like a minimal viable product, like something you can give to someone to see if you were right about your prediction on if it was useful or not to them. >> Yeah, that's the main thing like Andrew Ang said this really well. He did the Y combinator speech. You know, people think about they look at like senior developers speed up like AI is making developers 20% faster, 30% faster.

### ⚡ セクション 63

But those are like senior developers who are already fast. They already know what to do and they're working on like serious production code that has to be proper. If you're building an MVP, AI makes you probably 20x faster minimum. Like you can just type in a single problem and see a website. Boom.

### 🌟 セクション 64

And like change something, add a new feature. And you don't have to worry about security or or you know structure of the codebase. You're just trying to prove your idea. Obviously before you scale it and release it to paying users, you want to add authentication, proper security, everything. But you can validate the idea or invalidate the idea much faster.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So that is where the biggest gains are. >> Absolut yeah this this is absolutely true and I think a lot of people don't it's it sounds simple but people don't don't grasp this idea. We just opened up worldwide creativity. You know what I mean? We just everybody can Yeah.

### 📋 セクション 66

It it's a gamecher. We just haven't quite seen it the wave hit but it will. It's it's almost like the term uh should be called like rapid experimentation or something or like you know what I It's like vibe coding almost gives it the wrong kind of tone when you're a when you're not already a senior developer. >> Yeah, I feel like that was good for the first month or two months when it came out and then it started quickly getting negative uh connotation like once people started shipping apps with complete you know security issues and stuff like that. Like when I was uh I was very aware of my deficiencies and you know before I like scaled it I did I did consulting with like developers.

### ⭐ セクション 67

So I like paid people like $200 an hour, $300 an hour to like tell me what's wrong, look at my code. Some of them were able to spot security issues with like matter of minutes. So you know people have to be smart like if you are not developer you probably have to get someone to like check the most important stuff even if you're using AI to build fast. >> Yeah. Yeah.

### 📝 セクション 68

Absolutely. Absolutely. >> What uh what form factor do you think we sort of move towards? Um you know Zuckerberg's been pushing sort of the glasses and the Aarth experience and seems like other people Yeah. And other people seem to believe it's sort of an all audio situation, more like a Star Trek, like just talk.

### 💡 セクション 69

>> Glasses. I I'm big believer in glasses. I don't have them. I tried buying them in like I don't know, they didn't ship to Czech Republic. They didn't ship to Dubai, so I don't have them.

### 🔧 セクション 70

But I think it's definitely glasses because it's the same inputs as the humans, right? It can see what you see and it can hear what you hear. And the LLM can speak in a way where like people basically around you cannot hear it. It's not as good as having like, you know, headphones or AirPods, but it it will be audible and it'll be it'll be capable of running a small local model or connecting, you know, via internet to a bigger model. So, I think glasses absolutely are the next smartphone.

### 🎯 セクション 71

>> Yeah, I believe it. And just in the last few days, we saw the new Zuckerberg new meta glass that came out. People are saying that you're able to see a very bright display, but nobody else can. You can't even capture it on camera. Um, and it's not even augmented reality yet to where it interacts with the world, so to speak.

### 💭 セクション 72

It's just a sort of a display and you move your fingers to control it. Um, I am interested in getting those. They're expensive. I think close to a,000 bucks here. But I think that technology is going to get, you know, just like everything else.

### 📌 セクション 73

You got the first adopters paying the premium funding, you know, the mass-produced stuff that happens every single time. So, pretty soon, I mean, once they get to a few hundred bucks, everybody's going to be wearing them. It's going to be it's going to be interesting because I mean, all of them have cameras on it. So it's like, you know, I mean, there's a lot of places where somebody walks through with glasses, you're like, "Hey buddy, don't look at me. I don't want to." >> Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 74

On the other side, I would say, >> Yeah. >> Every city has uh cameras everywhere. So like I almost care less if like some stranger has footage on me than the government, you know? >> Like I'm I'm I don't like government having CCTV everywhere. Like if some stranger captures like it literally happened to me a few days ago.

### 📚 セクション 75

I was biking through a forest like in the evening and it was some like 70-year-old guy probably like doing some mushroom hunting and he was like the old button phone like the generation before smartphones and he just like took a two second video of me and then put his phone down. I was like what what is this you know but I like I know he's cannot do anything with that but I'm I'm much more worried like about government surveillance. So like if people have glasses that can record like so what? >> Yeah. you would you prefer it all be uh open source like NLMs we can all control then yeah >> same >> I think like people say like oh I would never put something into my brain well guess what like people who put something into their brain is going to be 10,000 times more productive right so then you're going to just fall behind so so rapidly well the answer is open source protocol if it's something that like a million developers across the globe can look at and see like this is safe there's no back door it's like cryptographically proof then Yeah, I I would I would probably do that, right?

### 🔖 セクション 76

Obviously, not the first version or second version where it's untested, but like once it's safe, I think same thing here. It has to be open source. Absolutely. Yeah. Uh are you planning to come to any of the sort of US-based or any tech conferences?

### 🎨 セクション 77

Like what are you looking at? Dubai is uh getting pretty big. I I I've never visited, but I want to. I mean, kind of what's what does that look like for you? >> Well, I was in New York like uh two weeks ago for the NA10 event.

### 🚀 セクション 78

>> Okay. So they were they were launching their New York office. So that was great. Shout out to the team at NA10. Um Dubai is growing for sure.

### ⚡ セクション 79

I think Dubai has like very split in terms of people there. You know there's like a lot of people from crypto, a lot of people there's content creators, a lot of people doing info products, a lot of people doing sales. AI is still kind of untapped. I I know like maybe like four or five people that do AI, but I feel like the AI community there is growing. >> Oh yeah, absolutely.

### 🌟 セクション 80

What did the uh so like if you go back in time what do you think the skills are today that people should be learning? I mean would you I don't know >> I mean look I'm just going to answer myself like I'm trying to become a crack developer. So I have this book you know this famous book designing data intensive applications. Uh I'm trying to like improve my tech skills cuz I feel like you know it's a complete myth like oh you shouldn't learn how to code like if you know how to code you can just move way faster with way more confidence like you know how to review what the the code the AI wrote right? So I'm trying to upskill myself technically as much as possible.

### 🎬 セクション 81

But I would say like if someone is in sales, they should be using the best reasoning models to get a better better at sales, right? Like Sam Alman tweeted this I think a few months back and I think he was half trolling and half serious, but he said like if you're not spending 3 hours a day skill maxing with 03, you're not going to make it. And I absolutely agree. Maybe maybe it's like 60 minutes a day, maybe it's two hours. But if you're not trying to heavily push every single day your skill set, whatever you're trying to do, if you're trying to be a great marketer, do that with marketing.

### 📋 セクション 82

If you're trying to be a developer, do that with code. Doesn't matter. But you can just learn so much faster with AI now. It it's insane. >> Yeah, that's that's true.

### ⭐ セクション 83

So like for me, I know that so 03 Pro came out not that long ago. Now it's GPT5 Pro. So specifically like that research grade intelligence. Like if that got taken away from me now, I would be in trouble. Like I would feel it.

### 📝 セクション 84

I'm at a point in my life where like that's I need that technology because now I'm not you know used to be you know you have some ideally you need to research that would take dozens of YouTube searches, YouTube video or you know Google searches, YouTube videos, etc. Now I just put it in there and it will take whatever 5 to 10 minutes whatever but it comes back and boom you have like really good information. Every once in a while I find that it messes up and just sort of leads me astray a little bit, but that's usually where there's just not a lot of data online. Yeah. >> For good if you give it enough context.

### 💡 セクション 85

There's a lot of context. It just like chews through it. It just presents you like the final. It's beautiful. I love it.

### 🔧 セクション 86

>> You know, it's funny when you said that. That's the first time I realized that. I think the way I if I don't have my cell phone, if I realize I like left it in the car or something and I kind of like oh stress out because nobody can contact me. I think right I think now if Yeah. Chad GBT was gone.

### 🎯 セクション 87

if no large language models, no like nothing for the next two weeks, I'd be like I'd get that same feeling. So that's how I know I I think I'm addicted now or it's part of my life in a deeper way. >> Yeah, deep research is huge, you know, like anytime I want to solve a problem, I just like open up boom perplexity research, claw deep research, ch research, grog, deep research. I just like >> I can solve a problem like 10 times faster than before. Before I would have to go on YouTube, watch a tutorial.

### 💭 セクション 88

Okay, this didn't wasn't relevant. Watch another tutorial. Like now thanks to deep research you can just move so fast. >> What do you think about the thoughts that there could be a single person with a billion dollar company in the next couple years? I mean do you think >> okay you think we might see if you had to >> I mean thinking from first principles like why not you know it's like there's no mathematical or physical law preventing that.

### 📌 セクション 89

I'm betting that well so we we have to see how these uh agent marketplaces start developing because um we'll see and we're going to see it within the next few months but I think that Google saw the whole thing ahead of time because just like now we go to Amazon we go to Google uh we go to these places to find our goods and services and all this stuff eventually it's going to be replaced by everyone having their own agents that go out there on our behalf just like right now when I type in a GPT5 pro thing it goes out there. My agent goes out there, searches all the websites in the future there. It's also going to be, you know, booking tickets and doing my taxes and interacting with the agents. >> The people that jump on board early for these cuz I I I've been kind of in the do space for a while and like the early movers tend to win. So, the people that started in SEO before anybody knew what SEO meant, dominated.

### ✅ セクション 90

Facebook ads, same thing. Amazon, same thing. I would not be surprised if within the first year of these agentic marketplaces going live, somebody with probably something pretty simple really just blows up. Maybe not a billion dollar valuation, but I mean you can make millions, tens of millions, maybe 100 million with some simple uh uh agents that just capture the space first. Um can you like walk me through though?

### 📚 セクション 91

What what does it look like? I mean, if you're like garbage disposal doesn't work, do you think you take a photo of it and then the agent like figures out you need a plumber and then compares prices and then schedules it for you? >> Well, so so the specific Google um example that they gave is like let's say you're hiring, right? You have an HR a number of HR agents, right? So some of them go through the resume to figure out if they match your job.

### 🔖 セクション 92

Some of them might do an interview, you know, maybe kind of a back and forth. Some of them are in charge of doing background checks. So for this point, they go online and look for the agents that do background checks. And for example, they find, okay, this one agent, agent X, is the best at US-based background checks. And agent Y is the best at international background checks.

### 🎨 セクション 93

So they send the applicants that are US-based to the US-based agent and the international to the international. That's somebody else's company. That's somebody else's agent. They do the background check. They charge them.

### 🚀 セクション 94

Whether that's on the crypto layer like we were talking about with those microtransactions or whatever fee they charge because again no human involved the cost is super super low. So I mean it's like either you're I mean it could be very inexpensive. Uh then that agent gets the report back and flags anything for you, right? So the human sits there and and he just sees like background check in progress and then like a week later or whatever it's like okay all good. That's that's all you see as the human.

### ⚡ セクション 95

But behind the scenes, all the agents are interacting because a lot of this is sort of automated. Um, >> wow. >> So, what was your question? I always forget. >> No, I just want some examples.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Yeah, you should, David. Like, how do you imagine it playing out? >> Well, that was actually Yeah, my next question like what where's the power like for those things like do you have an example of somebody cuz I mean you talk to a lot of people in your community that have business sort of minds. >> I can give the same example like the hiring, right? Like what you said is probably more advanced, but with the hiring, you can literally do this in a matter of 10 minutes if you know how to use NA10.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Like all it takes is a Google sheet, right? You're collecting applicants for a job. And then each time a new row is added, you do an open router call to perplexity deep research about that person and you load the context with you know you ask them provide your LinkedIn, provide your previous job experience. Tell me like you know why I should hire you and you you depending on the job obviously you ask some questions and then you have the AI agent do research check if they actually work at that company. Is there any like criminal record of that person?

### 📋 セクション 98

Is there any controversies about that person? And you also have a separate agent that's a powerful reasoning model like a validate their answers and against the job like you would do a deep research what does a worldclass candidate for this role look like and then the AI agent compares that against that specific person and before you even start doing any interviews you come into your Google sheet and you already have this person 7 out of 10 you know fits well but doesn't have that many years of experience this person two out of 10 uh the company he worked at never listed him and he's probably lying because of this or that. This person 10 out of 10 he fits the job execution exactly blah blah blah blah like right now people can just build this like TB research u automation it's not even an agent that would save them so much time hiring and this like every company that's hiring if they deploy this they would save tens of thousands of dollars probably and it's something that people can build in 10 minutes in any time. >> Wow. Yeah.

### ⭐ セクション 99

And that's with today's technology. That's crazy. >> Yeah. >> Um Yeah. I don't know.

### 📝 セクション 100

It just feels like it's all going so quickly. So, I'm trying to just project out what even a year or two looks like. And especially for a company that wants to scale to a billion dollars, like they would have to have so many agents deployed. And then also like agents marketing for agents to make sure that they get hired by other agents and their scores stay high. Like it'll just be sort of wild.

### 💡 セクション 101

I wonder if it'll just be like a compute game. >> I think it's going to be specializing game. Like basically a year ago or maybe you know a year and a half ago I was making videos on everything in AI because it was still possible to kind of keep up right now it's not possible to keep up. Now like I'm not making any videos on like uh video models or you know I mean I made one on nano banana that's image model but basically I stick to my lane which is like AI coding right and technical stuff and I think it just becomes more specialized as there is more thing like it's even impossible to keep up with AI coding right there's like so many tools every single day like literally you mentioned uh the GPD5 codex right just came out obviously I tried that but like there's so many tools I still want to try that I literally don't have time to try and I think it's just going to be hyper specializ ized like every person is like okay one person picks you know AI video one person picks like AI for doctors one person picks AI for lawyers and there's going to be people who are hyper specialized which is why I don't believe there's like you know death of SAS because if someone is hyper specialized in something they can build a great SAS and price it fairly whether monthly or usage base and make a really great agent for taxes rather than me who has zero experience filing taxes I wouldn't try to vip code my own agent I would pay someone who has 10,000 hours in, you know, tax filings or whatever who build that agent. >> That's the way to do it.

### 🔧 セクション 102

So, I think it's going to be hyper specialized. Everybody's going to be locked in on their >> thing they like. >> Dude, there's probably going to be a whole new insurance for like for agents, too, you know, like for the companies that do have a bunch of agents deploying taxes and then there'll be like all these specialized >> insurance companies that are going to pop up and have technical knowledge. That'll be like a whole another vertical I hadn't thought about till now. >> Yeah.

### 🎯 セクション 103

>> Yeah. So, we've we've talked a lot of uh for some people boring business stuff. I mean, we all get super excited about it. That's kind of our uh uh part of the excitement, but let's get get into some crazy subjects. This is the second hour, the second half of the interview.

### 💭 セクション 104

>> So, I mean, what are your craziest AI theories or projections? Uh yeah, what craziest? Okay. H >> I mean, you mentioned the singularity, too. So it sounds like uh >> it sounds like you think seven years is kind of like when it hits and like things really really really change for humans.

### 📌 セクション 105

>> I wouldn't say seven years. I I said five to seven years is like where I I'm certain like what the future not certain but like I think again 5 to seven years we're probably still going to be working humans and agents. I wouldn't say seven years until Singularity. I'm probably closer to 20 years until super intelligence. Um like just you know being more in the field and seeing how AI works.

### ✅ セクション 106

I feel like it's easy like I feel like 2023 everybody was kind of you know maximum hype everybody was new to this trying to understand it and also we have to be careful because when listening to the CEOs which usually are the most popular people most influential people in the AI industry right Sam Alman Dario Amod Elon Musk these guys have the most interest in overhyping the technology they have literally tens of billions if not hundreds of billions on the line for the AI hype to continue so we have to realize this and we have to realize okay what are people's incentives Their incentives is to overhype it as much as possible. AI is going to replace all jobs. AI is going to, you know, create hundred trillion dollars windfall to raise another round of funding, you know, to get more money from investors and to keep the >> stock market hype going. So, we have to be careful listening to the people who have the most incentive to overhype. But I would say like I still believe in technological progress.

### 📚 セクション 107

And again, I don't see any reason why AI wouldn't become generally intelligent in the future, better than humans at all things. So I think it is going to happen but not as fast as some of these tech CEOs make it seem. >> Yeah, agreed. I mean just a couple days ago Demi Hassabis was saying um how you know LLMs aren't obviously AGI they're not P PhD level anything we need couple new breakthrough couple different breakthroughs to get there like continuous learning LLM models are static there's a few papers that were published about how that might change but at the at the time you know they're not they're not able to sort of rewire their their weights so to speak um and then also like the in context learning isn't as advanced as we wanted it to be. Um, so as powerful as they are, they're not quite like like human like minds yet.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Um, but there's tons of stuff they can still do, but he's saying 5 to seven years until we get to that PhD level general sort of AGI intelligence. Um, no, sorry, he said 5 to 10 years. Um, but yeah, >> I think we need a new breakthrough. Like I I don't see LLMs getting us there to be honest because like u is there are sequence models in the predicting the next token and if you look at like I was reading a book about Isaac Newton right and how he invented a lot of the stuff that he invented and came up with these original thoughts and he like gave some formula that if you want to solve a problem you have to like look at a blank piece of paper like he had like infinite patience basically and he also did like calculations to like 55 decimal points on on paper you know he was he invented calculus So this is like something that LLMs they've been around for like what two and a half years now almost 3 years they haven't invented anything like not even like a small breakthrough in you know physics or biology chemistry I'm not talking about like world changing technology I'm talking about like some small discovery and they haven't been able to do that at all and if you took any human right this is this is not my idea I've heard it in a podcast but like if you took any human and you gave him like 1 millionth of the amount of tokens that these models have that human would be like full with noble prizes, right? A humans are like a human brain is much better at generalizing and creating ideas than LLMs.

### 🎨 セクション 109

So I like I really think there needs to be some new breakthrough on the architecture level before we see like any real AGI progress. >> Interesting. Um, yeah, I'd be very curious to see what the next sort of evolution with the sort of reinforcement learning that they're doing where they're scaling it up and having it selfplay, having that whole alpha alpha zero kind of approach. Um, because like with Grock, we're seeing some very interesting things and that's I think because Elon just has access to massive amounts of compute to throw at the at the sort of the reinforcement learning. So there's that's interesting.

### 🚀 セクション 110

But man, I feel like if we don't see too much progress there, then it's like all right, it's going to pl plateau out a little bit. Um yeah, >> the progress I think would be concentrated. If you look at, you know, we've seen the gold Olympiad in math, we've seen like crazy programming progress. Why? Because those are verifiable, right?

### ⚡ セクション 111

You can have the AI run 500 times completely experimental each time and see like okay in one of these times the code ran without errors right you cannot do that with uh creative writing or even like sales or marketing there's no right answer for what a marketing campaign should look like but with code if it runs it runs right with math if if the proof is valid the math is correct so you can use synthetic data and you can use like experimentation way more aggressively so my prediction would be that we see tons of progress But it's going to be in less domains until there's some new breakthrough I think. >> But here's the question like you know for machine learning advancement machine learning sort of progress AI progress most of it is code and math. So most of what these people do to advance the field forward is code and math. You think it's possible that LLMs alone could get to the point where they add some sort of a recursive self-improvement kind of start that process kick off that process or you think there's no way? Well, it it is possible.

### 🌟 セクション 112

Like I absolutely believe it's possible. But like again, what time zone or timelines are we talking about? I think if we talk about like five years, I think it's much more likely researchers plus these models which already are happening obviously but it will just that will just be way more powerful where you have a researcher that is the person like trying to think of these unique analogies like there I was listening to a person who described how working with Jeff Hinton was which is you know he's one of the OGs the godfather of AI and he like his way of doing research is like trying to make analogies to like animals or you know household objects and trying to like kind of play with the ideas and experiment experiment with them in their head. It's not like doing math equations on a you know blackboard how people think. So this is what the LMS cannot do yet.

### 🎬 セクション 113

I definitely think it's possible right? But if I had to say like the next 5 years which again there's going to be tremendous progress in the next 5 years. I don't want to make it seem that there isn't. There's massive progress every single month. But if I had to say like what the future looks like in the next 5 years I think it's human experts researchers working with the models to do research.

### 📋 セクション 114

If you say 20 years or even 15 years, maybe it is the self-improving AI. >> Yeah. >> Like what what happens when you just put like 24 hours in a row of an AI just solving a coding problem? Like why why doesn't it get there? And like what does a human need to step in for?

### ⭐ セクション 115

>> It's all the context like outside of it. Like humans, we don't understand how many how much context we have, right? We understand how the world works. We understand like social dynamics. A lot of this is not even on the internet.

### 📝 セクション 116

Lord, this is like not even described. When you join a new company as an intern, nobody tells you like, listen, this is the CEO. Have some respect for him. You kind of understand it instinctually, right? This person is more powerful than me.

### 💡 セクション 117

He has power over me. I should listen to what he does. This is not like described in text on the internet. Same with physics. No one is describing like if you throw a phone across the room, it hits the wall and it destroys.

### 🔧 セクション 118

The amount of tokens on the web describing this physical interaction that even a 5-year-old understands is so little. So this is the limitation of the current data because humans they're literally like trained since the beginning on so many input tokens like a child child people think children are not doing anything. They think oh I remember being a kid you know I wasn't productive. That's not the case. Kids are insanely productive.

### 🎯 セクション 119

They're they're like fine-tuning their brain their neural network every single day. Right? Think about the kid from like 0 to 3 years old. They they spawn with like no information. I mean obviously there's something in our DNA some like you know fear of snakes or something like that but very little understanding of the world but they learn all the physics they learn social dynamics right this human is bigger than me I should probably be scared scared I shouldn't buy that human >> this is not written on the web in text form so the LM don't understand it so when you give them a coding task they don't understand like the the role of them in the company or what the company is doing or the vision of the company or the current trends that are happening all of the like intuitive stuff that a human perfectly understands LLM Yeah, and we've actually seen some brand new architectures where that learning happens.

### 💭 セクション 120

It's not LLMs, it's something else, but where that happens so much faster with so much less sort of sample size they say, right? So for LMS, you got to get a lot of Yeah. a lot of sort of examples. There are faster ways to pick pick that up and it's usually done through some sort of predictive thing. So, like going back to because you had that example before where I could like put the spreadsheet together for you and like do these searches, but I guess the future of that would look more like maybe a whole physical world where somebody some kind of future agent actually learned emotional skills and learned how to like read eyes and understand who trustworthy people are and it would start adding that kind of context to the the future of that spreadsheet.

### 📌 セクション 121

>> Yeah. Yeah, I mean when you have like, you know, Optimus is releasing the Optimus 3, which is a humanoid robot from Tesla, I think that's going to unlock a whole new level of what's possible because again, you can have the robot experiment in real physical space and test different things, right? Maybe like a chemist would test different compounds together and see what happens. Uh, so I think that's going to unlock a whole new level of AI progress for sure. The question is like how much of of the intuition is in our DNA?

### ✅ セクション 122

I think that's still not answered. you know how much of the biological human brain is the magic because there is like you can take a single human and see him you know or her evolve over time and learn over time but uh evolution is also like a long-term training process right and that I think is going to be the harder puzzle to crack >> yeah it's wild because yeah if you imagine an optimist robot sitting in a boardroom and it tries to glaze the CEO and the CEO is like trying too hard people give it a look and it's like I'm going to remember I screwed up with that glazing thing or that comment or that >> you know but then it's going to go up to the cloud and it's going to teach all the other Optimus robots like hey by the way like here's a better way to like suck up to the CEO if you want to get what you want you know it's just all that information is a has to be collected and like kind of learned >> people have our own like personal agents protecting us like when we get to that point it will it will not be that you know someone has AI agent like if you're in a CEO in a board meeting you will have your own series of agents that are like searching the web of info about you or like analyzing the footage from that meeting and see if you like revealed something for your body language like yeah I think that point is like very hard to see what the future is like I think that's probably like 10 years minimum away >> yeah what are you most excited about in terms of like some of the upcoming model releases or any products that you're using like what's the most exciting thing that you're playing around with right now >> I mean I would say uh I'm mostly using the coding stuff right cloud code is great codex I think codex is more powerful than cloth code, but cloth code is better to use. Clothe code is just like explains it better, uses more clear, better formatted language, but if I had to like solve a deep, you know, difficult bug, I'm giving it to uh Codex. I mean, actually, I'm giving it to both and, you know, then comparing their plans, stuff like that. But from my experience, Codex is definitely more powerful.

### 📚 セクション 123

Um, yeah, I'm mostly using the coding tools every single day. >> Yeah, that makes sense. And what do you recommend for people getting started? Like I know you've kind of I know you're saying there's too much to experiment, but like regular people. >> Yeah, I I think it depends.

### 🔖 セクション 124

Like if someone has already some programming experience, they probably will like should jump into cursor right away because it's a full IDE. But if people don't even know what an IDE is, then they should probably stick to like the simple tools, right? Whether it's Lovable, Bold, uh create anything.com, there's a lot of these like vibe coding tools that are just plain English. So I think that's where people can start and like once they want to continue developing their project they should move it to an IDE you know start using cloud code a lot of people are scared of the terminal which is where cloud code runs and you know codeex CLI runs but uh if you if you are able to go through that mental hurdle and you know not be scared of the terminal I think cloud code is great like it's you type it in plain English and can do anything >> and it feels like cursor is kind of the big one is that the seem like the >> cursor is like a full suite of products right >> yeah cursor is the IDE so it's built on top of VS Code. It's a fork of VS Code.

### 🎨 セクション 125

So, it has all the same features as VS Code, which is the code editor from Microsoft, one of the most used and you know, it's open source, so that's why people can fork it. But it's one of the most used IDs in the world. And it it has everything a developer needs basically. And cursor just forked that and build on top of that, adding lots of AI features. First, they added autocomplete.

### 🚀 セクション 126

So, you type and it predicts what you're about to type, whether you start a new function and it finishes it, right? Super useful. This is actually something that every developer should use no matter like even the ones that are like anti-AI there's zero argument for not using cursor tab also autocomplete because it's just pure time safe. Then the second level was the command K where you highlight like a specific block of code and you give it like what to change and it changes that. And then the the third level is the cursor agent which is like you just type it and it can change any files you know it can analyze your whole code based stuff like that.

### ⚡ セクション 127

Now the next pivot is like the background agents. Um but we'll see like right now I think Codex has the most successful one but more companies like Devon you know from Cognition um Ker has their own background agents more companies are trying to do that. Yeah I guess so. Yeah because you have a lot of experience with this. So I feel like just listening to what you're saying kind of my own experience maybe the best way to push brand new people is straight to cursor because number one like you said it's built on VS Code.

### 🌟 セクション 128

VS Code is open source and everybody's building their stuff on top of it because the Google Firebase they build on top VS Code. Winds surf is VS Code, you know, plus chatbot. All the other ones seem like they're they're very very similar. Um, and like you said, some people are initially there's some hesitations about working with the the command line interface in cursor. You do kind of play around with it because it's it's there.

### 🎬 セクション 129

You have to interact with it a little bit, but it's also not the main driver. The main driver is you just talking to the chatbot. So from that perspective maybe if somebody wants to get started doesn't know too much maybe just saying start with cursor that might be the first and easiest step right the fastest step just get learning would you agree with that >> sure I mean if that person is competent then yeah if if that person is like very beginner like someone who like >> you know we all know those people I usually like categorize them as they spend more time on their phone than a computer >> like if if you know some of these people that don't even have a computer right and they just like only have a phone I was like I don't know how those exist. But those people, I would not recommend them cursor because they cannot even use it. I would just recommend something simpler, right?

### 📋 セクション 130

Whether it's Vzero, whether it's bold, lovable, something like that. >> Okay. I mean, I I I haven't tried those. So I Yeah, I guess there's probably stuff that's easier. >> Yeah, those are like the vibe coding tools, you know?

### ⭐ セクション 131

Those are like complete vibe coding. You you never look at the code. It's just like full vibes. >> Actually, can you just name what the landscape looks like right now? Like just the companies that are doing things?

### 📝 セクション 132

>> Yeah. So there's a lot of companies actually. It it's like it's funny because it feels like everybody's building the same thing. So, you know, there's uh I think the first really popular one was Bolt Bold. New then we see Vzero from Versell.

### 💡 セクション 133

Then Lovable had crazy growth. That's a company from Europe. Actually, they have the fastest one to one million growth of all companies of all time. Uh then there's a emergent which is great as well. There's a anything.com also known as create anything.

### 🔧 セクション 134

A lot of these vibe coding apps, some of them specialize for like mobile apps. For example, Ror R O R K specializing just for mobile app development. But uh yeah, the field is getting crazy competitive. >> Yeah, everybody's kind of going after Yeah. this particular field.

### 🎯 セクション 135

Even the big companies are all building their own versions of it, which is super interesting. >> Um so who do you think is going to win the coding model landscape? Is it OpenAI? Do you think Grock has a shot? It's been very competitive but a little bit clunky.

### 💭 セクション 136

I mean anthropic has been I mean they're they're all good in their own ways I guess. >> I mean actually I was surprised today I've seen the chart where Grock code fast so this is the latest model from God is the most used on open router. >> Yeah. >> So I was shocked by that. I I didn't know it was so popular >> but uh yeah >> bigger than all the other ones combined right?

### 📌 セクション 137

Yeah, I think 1.1 trillion per week or something crazy amount of tokens uh because it's it's like a smaller faster coding model. So, it's not as powerful as like Opus 4.1 or GBD5 High, but it's like very efficient, right? So, a lot of people still care about cost, right? Like I I have all the $200 a month subscriptions, so I don't really care, but a lot of people do care about cost. So, that's where the Grock code fast model is.

### ✅ セクション 138

I mean, yeah, Grock, Enthropic, and OpenAI are the main players for sure. I think uh Google with Gemini 3 which is coming soon could be interesting. I I definitely wouldn't you know put Google out of the race but honestly like stuff is changing so fast like whatever I can recommend right now I think in a month my my AI stack will be very different. So that that's the tricky part you know like things are changing so fast like which comp one company has a great model this month next month it's completely different. >> What about talking to images?

### 📚 セクション 139

Like I mean it seems like it seems like no matter what you code you still have to build a UI and like you did your nano banana video. Like do any of them talk or does a human always have to do the artwork and then tell it like now put this PNG here and then nobody knows how to like glue the two together with just automation. >> I mean there's MCP like the playright as MCP where the models can literally take screenshots of the website. They can see the console. They can do the whole front end development and debugging.

### 🔖 セクション 140

So I think they can do it all like especially front end. I've seen this is a trend by the way. I've seen this recently. VIP coded front end and like handcrafted back end. A lot of people are really going with this where like the authentication the core business logic the security the database the architecture all of that should be humanmade very carefully thought of but in the front end you can just full send it with AI.

### 🎨 セクション 141

>> Yeah. And I' I'm seeing some offering some services too that startups where they do that. that they allow people to create their front end apps and websites and whatever. And then part of the service that the company provides is kind of like the back end, all the all the security, all the authentication, all that stuff. That's >> there's going to be yeah a lot more people building stuff, but they they're not going to be able to they shouldn't be touching the back end unless they have developers or they're developers themselves.

### 🚀 セクション 142

Um, and yeah, this thing that you've mentioned like the the playright and various different approaches where the LM needs to look at the website and actually like troubleshoot or if it's building a game, actually look at the game just like you and I would screenshots or video. >> That seems to be like a big uh bottleneck, bottleneck, stumbling block, whatever you want to call it. Because man, that's where they kind of suck with the vision stuff like that because I feel like that's the final piece. If you add that that they can just like recursively kind of run, look at what they're doing and try to fix it. That would be kind of the thing next big leap I feel like.

### ⚡ セクション 143

But it's the same thing as like it's taste, you know, and the LLMs don't have any taste. It's the same thing as like writing an email. Obviously, the models can write an email, but they cannot write a great cold email because everybody will know like this is AI written. like it just feels weird, you know, they like do the long dashes, they like over complement or something like that. I think it's the same with the front end, right?

### 🌟 セクション 144

Like to your point, Dylan, they can definitely create the code. They can definitely write the front end. But if you if you you can like use cloud code to generate 10 different front ends, but the real skill or like 100, right? Why not? But the real skill is like knowing which of these hundreds is good.

### 🎬 セクション 145

>> That is the real skill. Same with YouTube. You can have the models generate 1,000 title variations, right? But I don't use AI for titles. But why?

### 📋 セクション 146

Because it has no taste, right? Like I've made hundreds of videos, if not thousands at this point myself. I know what a great title looks like. I've studied like successful YouTubers. I I I just have this taste and I just have this good judgment.

### ⭐ セクション 147

The models don't have good judgment. They can easily give you 100 variations, but the the tricky part, the difficult part is knowing which of them are bad and which are good. >> Yeah. It's funny you say it just because I know Wes through all these podcasts just keeps bringing that up. He's like taste.

### 📝 セクション 148

It's all about taste. Taste is the future. Like that's what we need as humans to see. So feel like you uh hit his talking point without knowing it. >> Well, I mean that's I guess my advice to people like try to develop your taste.

### 💡 セクション 149

>> And if like if people are, you know, not willing to like if assuming they're building a startup or whatever, if you're not willing to go deep into the code and really understand how it works, you're not going to develop a good taste, you know. So that's what it requires. And I think whatever domain people choose to pursue trying to really refine their judgment and you know test their beliefs like you know if you're not wrong like 20 30% of the time you're probably not pushing enough with your ideas. So yeah developing taste that's that's the future for sure. >> Absolutely.

### 🔧 セクション 150

Uh well look thank you so much for doing this interview. I think you're definitely going places. I expect you to just uh I I expect you to keep pl climbing and just uh hitting new highs because you're definitely >> um just how you see the world, how like you you're staying hungry no matter what what level you get to. That's a beautiful thing to see. Um I guess as any any last thoughts you want to tell people about kind of where the world is going or what they should be focusing on and also where can people find you, where can they test out all your offerings and just anything else that you want to say?

### 🎯 セクション 151

>> Yeah. So my YouTube channel is David Andre. Um I would say test out vector.ai. It's a task management tool. So if people are using notion to-d doist, I would say give it an honest shot.

### 💭 セクション 152

You know, it's it's not perfect, but I think if people appreciate being on the cutting edge of AI and trying to use the latest and greatest AI tools that save the most time, I think they're going to like vectal. Um in terms of my final message, I would say what people are doing, they should really try to do the hard decision and look into the future. Like it's very difficult, right? But a lot of people are just like either in college for jobs that might not even exist or they're in careers that are going to be replaced very soon. Like try to look at be realistic.

### 📌 セクション 153

Remove your ego. Like if you spend 15 years in a career, it's very hard to see like, oh [ __ ] this is going to be replaced. But you know, reality doesn't really care about that. The universe doesn't care about your ego. So try to see where the world is headed.

### ✅ セクション 154

Learn about the different trends. listen to all kinds of different voices and podcasts and and really like try to prepare yourself for the future whether it is financially, whether it is educational wise, whether it is like technology wise or you know what connections you have because a lot of people are avoiding doing a bit of discomfort today for a lot of discomfort in the future. You know, again, there's going to be some job replacement. There's going to be some job creation, but a lot of people are avoiding all the discomfort and then they're going to have like a big wave of discomfort where their entire industry is replaced or something happens, right? So, I would say like try to do what I did where it's like you, you know, maybe lessen your income or, you know, move to a different city or whatever.

### 📚 セクション 155

You make a hard decision today for not having to like have a complete, you know, big shock in the future. >> Absolutely agreed. All right. I think those are great words to live by now as we head into this uh exciting but a little bit scary future. So, thank you so much for being here.

### 🔖 セクション 156

>> Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you guys. >> Yeah, we'll we'll link uh we'll leave all the links down below. Uh check out the channel, check out the product.

### 🎨 セクション 157

We'll have all the links so you guys can visit it. Thank you so much for being here and we'll see you in the next
