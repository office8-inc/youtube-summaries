## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So let's check the position now. So if you open up this, you can see we are 12.7% up on the Solana short 20x leverage uh position we we made here. So maybe 40x is a bit too much. Let's do a 20x uh instead. So you can see here place order bitcoin is true uh is by true leverage 20 size.

### 📋 背景・概要

Okay, here we are $2 up. So I want to close this 2.9% up. Perfect. Okay, so lately there's been a lot of talk about using these LLMs to make uh trading in crypto. And you can see this post, Quen makes 51% profit compared to other models.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So if you try to zoom in a bit here, you can see it started out with $10,000 and it ended up with 15,000. So it made a 50% uh gain here on trading for about a week, I think, or something. So that was pretty impressive. So today uh I made an account on hyperlquid. So let me go there.

### 📝 詳細説明

So this is the same platform that they used in the experiment I think and they have an API. So that is what we going to use. Uh I have already created this. So I wanted to do this by if you go here we go to cloud. Uh I wanted to try to use MCP servers for this.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So we can be inside our claw agent here when we actually do the trading. I thought that could be pretty fun. So I created a hyperlquid MCP and if you look at the tools we have here we have an get account info we can get market data open positions we have we can place an order close a position and set leverage and some other stuff uh we just created here but the most important ones are kind of finding the positions placing the orders and we can do uh get account info right something like that and this should trigger the hyperlquid MCP just to see how much money we have in our account at this moment in time. So, you can see here we grab the account information. We have 93.97, right?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And you can see we have one position open as I showed you in the intro. And yeah, you can kind of see that. So, let's do that. So, let's get position positions. So, we can get the open positions we have.

### 🎯 応用例

You kind of understand how the MCP works. We can do everything here from our terminal and with the MCP tools. I think this is pretty cool and we can do some Yeah, terminal trading here. Yeah, you can see the position we have here. This is a short in Solana and we are $1 up.

### 💭 考察

So today I just wanted to show you kind of how I a simple setup how we did this and kind of how it works and how we can place trades, how we can monitor trades and yeah, just a fun project I had uh this morning. So uh I don't think I have a time in this video to kind of go through every single detail in the MCP server. But I want to do one example uh how this works now. So you can see uh here on the cursor under servers we have the hyperlquid MCP server that is local. This is not something that we connect to on the web.

### 📌 まとめ

Everything is running locally here. Right? So we have the hyperlquid server. We have the index.py and under the list of tools here we have a tool called place order. Right.

### ✅ 結論

And here is the actual function we are using. So this is the place order function. This is the function that is executing the request from the hyperlquid server here on the tool place order. Right. So I'm not going to go much more into detail but uh what I want to mention is if you want to build your own MCP servers, Hyperlid has a pretty good documentation.

### 📚 追加情報

So you can see as context here uh when I built this I collected 4,000 lines of uh documentation for the hyperlquid platform. So that is basically all I needed to build my MCP server. Now let me show you uh a couple of ways we can make trades here now using the MCP server. So uh I just logged into code in again. So I have created a custom command that's called crypto bro.

### 🔖 補足

This is more like an automated way of uh doing trading. So I set up this uh I'm going to show you this later, but I set up this uh workflow here in my/ commands that has like a stepbystep way of uh placing a trade, but let's try to do this manually now just by using the tools. So uh I'm going to start off with a prompt here. I want to do uh I want to place a trade on a cryptocoin. So I can do uh I want to place a trade on crypto.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Can you start by checking my balance? So hopefully now with the description we have this is going to understand that it has to call the get account tool and just bring up our $93 balance here, right? Yeah, that was perfect. So that works good. So we need some prices.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So I'm just going to do something like let's just pick four coins. Let's do get latest pricing for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Sana, and BNB. So let's just uh do those. Hopefully now Claude understands that it needs to do some parallel tool calling. Perfect.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So we use the get market data uh tooling here to grab all the information. We have the prices current price on ether uh Solana and BNB. Perfect. So now we have the pricing. We can start thinking about uh what coin looks the best for making a trade.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So we can just do what coin look the best for making a trade on at the moment. So then we are triggering the analyze funding opportunity. We are picking BNB. Okay. So let's run that.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And it says BNB is the most interesting here with a 7 uh minus 747 APR funding shorts paying long. Okay, but it doesn't hit the official signal yet. Yeah, we have some kind of signal we set up. But just ignore that for now. So you can see it asked me, do you want to scan all tradable coins?

### 📋 セクション 18

So I can say yes, do that. Let's see what happens. Do the let's do that. Let's trade uh check all the tradable coins if we can find something else. So, one of the suggestion is a 40x leverage trade on Bitcoin long.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So, I'm just going to do give me all the details on the 40x uh trade. So, maybe 40x is a bit too much. Let's do a 20x uh instead. Uh we don't need a 40x trade. So, let's do a 20x bet on Bitcoin uh long here.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, what I think is pretty cool if you have some questions like you're pretty new to this, you can always ask, right? So, we are not trading CFDs. So let me let's give an explanation of what we are trading here. So let's just explain simply what uh per trading is. So this is a bit different from CFD.

### 💡 セクション 21

So you can see we get the explanation here. What are uh perpetual futures? So we can do long, short and we can leverage this and yeah, you kind of get the point here. So yeah, you can also ask some questions. So yes, do the trade and let's just [music] t let's do the trade.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And now we're going to call up our MCP that's going to place a position. So you can see here place order Bitcoin is through is by true leverage 20 size. Okay, perfect. That was placed. Let's check our dashboard on Hyperlquid.

### 🎯 セクション 23

And you can see here we have our Bitcoin 20x long. And now we can kind of monitor this by clicking here. You can see we are already 0.2% up. And we can monitor this here. And you can see we made 21 cents already.

### 💭 セクション 24

So this is pretty snappy, right? So it's pretty fun to play around with. And we can close this whenever you want. And we can kind of set up a monitor and we can do something like so we can do a 2 minute sleep and then go get position. Okay.

### 📌 セクション 25

So you can see we are running the 120 sleep and after this is counted down, we're going to get our position, right? So let's just wait for that. Okay. So you can see the 2 minutes are up. Now it's going to trigger kind of the get position hopefully.

### ✅ セクション 26

I think so. Yeah, we are reading the shell output. Hopefully, we're going to get the position. Perfect. And you can see, okay, we are doing pretty well on the Bitcoin.

### 📚 セクション 27

I think if we look here, we are $2 up. So, I want to close this 2.9% up. Perfect. Uh, close the BTC post for profit. Right, you can see 228 up.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Close the position 100%. Boom. We got it. And we can do a control O. We can read here.

### 🎨 セクション 29

You can see kind of the JSON formatting here. And yeah, we took the profit. And now we can get our balance again, right? Let's see how much we have now. Okay, so we made a dollar.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Perfect. Something like that. Or at least we have $94 now. So yeah, that was like a full cycle. Um, I also have my automated setup.

### ⚡ セクション 31

I can just show you that, but I don't think we're going to do any more trades now. So, to do that, it's pretty straightforward. We can just do /cryptobro. And now kind of everything is set up. This should be running autonomously, right?

### 🌟 セクション 32

We are checking the bag first. That's okay. That was a bit Yeah. Uh yeah, you can see we are checking our position. We check for our open positions.

### 🎬 セクション 33

We have the Solana short. That means we have one position left because we maximum can have two open at the same time. So, we just keep on continuing. And this is more like an automated setup and we look for a trade and we can decide if we want to pick that or not. Right?

### 📋 セクション 34

So, yeah, I'm just going to let this run through and see what kind of suggestion we end up with here. So, you can see uh next trade lineup, BNB long. Um, yeah, let's do a BNB long trade. So, we can let that run for a while. That's fine.

### ⭐ セクション 35

We're going to do an $80 margin and yeah, that's fine. 10x size. Uh, run both. Okay. So, you can see we're going to place this.

### 📝 セクション 36

Nice. And yeah, that was it. If we go back here now and we do a refresh, you can see we have our BNB long trade. Perfect. Uh, okay.

### 💡 セクション 37

So, yeah, I don't really care what way this goes, but uh, that was the point just to show you how this works. And yeah, pretty simple. So, what I think is good about this is it's a way nice way to learn about this because you can always ask questions on the way. I do very small positions just to learn how this works. Uh there's not much edge in this now, but I was thinking maybe in the future we can try to add more edge here.

### 🔧 セクション 38

We can give more context and stuff like that. So there are definitely opportunities here. And I just had a lot of fun with this project, setting it up, playing around. It's so responsive, right? It's so quick and you can Yeah, you can see we can make this pretty cool things here.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Here we can do some social posting on this and it's just a fun thing to play around with. So you kind of learn about NCPs while you have some fun trading some crypto if you're into that and you just learn about stuff and ask questions on the run here. So yeah, had a lot of fun with this. So I definitely recommend going uh to check it out.
