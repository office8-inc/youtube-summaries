## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

You want ch and cloth to have infinite memory that is 100% local and private. Inside of cloth code, open up the sidebar. Go to the bottom. Click on your user and click on settings. Then go to the bottom and find developer.

### 📋 背景・概要

Click on edit config. It will open up this file right here cloth desktop config.json. You need to open this in any text editor, code editor, doesn't matter. And then we can actually use cursor or cloth code or codex to help us edit the JSON. So we need to copy the mcp.json and simply say update cloth by adding this new mcp at the bottom.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Enter. So I'm going to say update the schema of this second MCP to follow the setup from the screenshot. Just make sure to keep the directory as this. And I'm going to copy the directory of our folder. Now we need to close cloud desktop.

### 📝 詳細説明

Open up the terminal again. CD into me agent MCP folder. And then we need to start the MCP server. So we should have the agent still loaded, but we don't have the MCP server running. So type in uv run python.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And then we need to get into this location to get the server. py. So literally type in the name of the folder. And this will start the actual MCP server that clo can access to use agent.
