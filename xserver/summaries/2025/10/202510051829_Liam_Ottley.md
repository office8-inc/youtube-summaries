## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

In the AI age, pretty much no job is safe. Right now, you've got 41% of employers planning to reduce their workforce because of AI. But that's only half the story. And my agency, Morningside AI, we work with some of the world's biggest brands, from NBA teams to multi-billion dollar companies. And I can tell you a secret from on the inside of these companies.

### 📋 背景・概要

And that's that the vast majority of them have no clue what they are doing with AI. They are paralyzed and they are desperate for people on the inside to step up and lead. This is where a small group of people are quietly making themselves irreplaceable. even in this AI age. And these are what are known as the AI champion.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They're not coders or data scientists. They are the marketers and salespeople and HR pros who are on the inside and learning how to leverage AI within their departments. And the data backs this up. There are workers with these kinds of AI skills that are already commanding a 56% wage premium. So, in this video, I'm not just going to tell you what skills to learn.

### 📝 詳細説明

I'm going to be giving you the exact three-phase, 90-day blueprint to become an indispensable AI champion in your company. We're going to be breaking this journey into three 30-day phases. You've got phase one, which is mastering your domain. Phase two, which is hunting the bottleneck, and phase three, which is becoming the leader. And by the end of this video, you're going to have a clear path on how to make yourself completely irreplaceable in the AI age.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, let me give you the ground truth on why this opportunity is so real. So at my agency, Morningside AI, we are in the trenches and working with these large companies doing everything from AI audits to strategic road mapping to running workshops and training their executive teams what AI is and how it's being used and of course to building and deploying AI systems within their businesses. And through all this work, we see the same pattern over and over again. These companies are starving for internal leaders to step up and help lead the AI adoption within the company. They know that there are teams of consultants and developers like us that can point the way.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

But the real and lasting transformation has to be driven by people on their own team. And this isn't just a feeling that we get. The data shows exactly why this talent vacuum exists. Only one in 10 workers possess the AI skills that companies are desperately searching for these days. And that's where you come in.

### 🎯 応用例

The fastest way to become irreplaceable is to make yourself the answer to their biggest problem right now. You need to become the high initiative and high agency person who starts leading the charge on AI inside the company. And when you pop up on their radar as the one person who gets this AI stuff, they're going to cling on to you and you become a godsend to them. And don't just take it from me, some dude waving his hands around on the internet. Listen to Naval Raikham, one of the world's most respected technologists and investors talking about this exact strategy.

### 💭 考察

Easiest way to see that AI is not taking jobs or creating opportunities is go brush up on your AI, learn a little bit, watch a few videos, use the AI, tinker with it, and then go reapply for that job that rejected you and watch how they pull you in. And that's the entire strategy we're breaking down in this video. So, how do you become that kind of person that they want to pull in and never let go of? Well, you become what I call an AI generalist. To be that indispensable champion within the company, you need to be fluent across the AI landscape.

### 📌 まとめ

So, an AI generalist is like a modern-day polymath. Someone who uses AI to become part developer, part designer, part writer, part automation expert all at once by using AI. This might sound really difficult and unachievable, but it really just means mastering the four fundamental powers of the AIH. And I've done entire videos on this, but here's the core idea of the AI generalist. First power is the power to create.

### ✅ 結論

This is the ability to generate professional-grade media, which is images, video, audio, all from simple text prompts. Secondly is the power to connect. This is AI enhanced writing and communication. It's the ability to influence people by articulating your ideas with incredible clarity and speed by using AI tools. Thirdly, is the power to automate.

### 📚 追加情報

And this is when you can create AI agents and workflows using mostly no code tools to eliminate repetitive work. And you're essentially building an army of digital workers that operate for you or the company 24/7. And fourth and final is the power to build. And this is the ability to create simple software and tools, often without writing a single line of code using the vibe coding tools that have been blowing up recently. These days, people who are completely non-technical are in just minutes creating entire apps and dashboards and custom tools just by describing them to these AI tools that build the software for you.

### 🔖 補足

Now, in the path, the safest career path was the specialist. It's like a panda that only evolved to eat bamboo. In a stable environment, that worked perfectly. But right now, we are not in a stable environment. We're in a period of massive change.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And in times like these, the adaptable generalist such as like a raccoon that can eat anything and live anywhere. That is the one that thrives. So, specialist basically can see one piece of the puzzle, but an AI generalist sees the whole board. You can connect dots between marketing and sales and operations because you understand how AI applies to all of them. And because AI is such a broad technology, these are the most powerful and valuable people in organizations moving forward.

### 🚀 セクション 14

That's what makes you strategic and that's what makes you irreplaceable ultimately. So your mission for the first 30 days is to use AI to become twice as effective at your job. You're not going to be asking for permission. You're going to be building your skills in a silo to free up 5 to 10 hours of your week. This saves time that you stash up your war chest that's going to be used in the next phase.

### ⚡ セクション 15

But before I can give you the RO specific blueprints, we need a quick reality check on this stuff because that's probably the most important part of the video if I'm honest. This is not a spoonfed process. Learning AI, I can I mean I can give you the map in this video as I'm going to do. I can point you to the tools, but no one is going to come and do the hard work for you. But all the information out there to go deeper is on YouTube.

### 🌟 セクション 16

It's in communities. It's in free courses. You need to break out of the employee mindset that you are likely in that waits to be told what to do that expects everything to come on a silver platter. If you want a better life and you want to be able to secure your future and build your dream life with AI, you have to go out of your way to show some initiative. And that means watching some tutorials on a new AI video generator and then immediately trying to apply that to a project at your job.

### 🎬 セクション 17

It means seeing a gap where a tool could help your team and taking it upon yourself to build a simple prototype. There may not be an explicit tutorial on how to use AI for your specific thing, but you are the one that has to bridge that gap for the company. You are the one that connects the dots. And this is the single trait that will make it replaceable. being able to keep up with the new AI stuff that's coming out and then bringing that down and saying how can we use it in our teams and company.

### 📋 セクション 18

Okay, with that reality check over, let's get into the blueprints. So, the first step in this phase one is to pick the one to two powers that are most relevant to your role and deciding to master the core tools for that. For example, if you are in a marketing role, your powers will likely be create and connect. This is because your entire job revolves around creating some kind of compelling content and communicating value, triggering emotions, and mastering the cutting edge in AI media generation and also AI enhanced writing is going to give you an insane advantage and allow you to double, triple, or quadruple your productivity in the task that you do. AI video generation is one of the main things you're going to want to learn.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And you can start by researching and mastering tools like Higsfield or Google V3. There's plenty of tutorials on YouTube. You can go find out and in an afternoon figure out how to use these things. Once you're familiar with them, you can see what's possible for creating ad concepts and social content for whatever your role is. The next major category you're going to want to learn is AI image generation, so you can get proficient with Nana Banana, which is Google's leading image generation model.

### 📝 セクション 20

And with this, you can learn how to generate stunning visuals for ad campaigns for any kind of image generation needs. And as for AI enhanced writing, you need to move beyond just basic chatbt and look into more advanced writing co-pilots like Poppy AI that allow you to use multiple sources and context to craft incredible copy in your tone of voice. Next, if you're in sales, you might be looking more closely at the power to automate. And this is because your time is best spent on talking to prospects and closing deals, not on manual research and prep. So, building your own personal AI co-pilot is the ultimate form of leverage in your role.

### 💡 セクション 21

And so, your mission will be to build a personal AI co-pilot that does your pre-call research. And this is something you can build yourself right now without touching the company CRM. As for the toolkit to build this, you want to learn something like relevance AI to build a personal AI agent that scrapes a prospect's LinkedIn and their website as well for key talking points and then from that generates a pre-core report for you to skim over before the call. I actually show you exactly how to do this in my step-by-step 4-hour free course on AI agents, which I'll link down below. You can also look into tools like GenSpark to create customized slide decks or proposals for minutes using AI rather than ours.

### 🔧 セクション 22

If you're in finance or operations, your powers may be automate and build. And this is because your roles are all about data reporting and process efficiency. AI can supercharge your ability to analyze data and create tools that make workflow smoother for everyone. And for your toolkit, you should get very, very good at using Chat GPT's data analysis or things like Google Sheets AI to interpret spreadsheets and find trends across data. Then I'd recommend that you go and research and find all the cutting edge startups that are building AI tools specifically for finance and data analysis and start trying them out.

### 🎯 セクション 23

For the power to build, I'd be looking into things like lovable or bolt and you can use them to build simple no code applications for things like custom dashboards, display data for your team or a better project tracker operations. Now with the power to build using these no code AI web app builders, anyone can learn to build custom internal software. This is something we do a lot at Morningside. Or if you're in HR, your power would be to automate as well where HR is filled with these repetitive and process-driven tasks like screening candidates, managing employee data, and automation is your single biggest lever for adding strategic value to the company. For your toolkit, I'd recommend going deep on something like Air Table AI where you can create smart forms for job applications and then build powerful AI automation to screen and categorize and flag top candidates automatically.

### 💭 セクション 24

I've used this heavily in my own systems like my podcast application funnel and that's worked really like a charm. So, you can see the pattern here. For each role, the strategy is basically the same. First is to get familiar with the core consumer tools like chat GBT, Claude, Grock, and how they apply to your daily tasks. And this information is all out there.

### 📌 セクション 25

All you have to do is go and search for it. like how to use AI for X role. Secondly, you need to pick your power, eg automate or create. And thirdly, you need to go out and research the best-in-class tools for that power. Find the tutorials on how to use it and start applying them to your own work.

### ✅ セクション 26

And at the end of the 30 days, you will have a documented list of tasks that you've automated for yourself and a clear estimate of the time you've saved yourself. This is your proof. And with that newfound free time, this is your B chess, like we said before, and you're going to use it in phase two. You've made it through the first 30 days and you're making great progress. You've mastered your domain.

### 📚 セクション 27

You've built your own war chest of free time. And now you're going to invest that time to go from individual value to team value. So your mission for this month is simple and that's to find and solve one painful and repetitive problem for your team. This is how you make your new skills visible. And here's a tactical playbook to do that.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Step one is that for one week, your only job is to become the detective for inefficiency. Your primary tool is your ears. And you're just needing to listen. What task is everyone doing in your team that they hate? What report takes forever to build?

### 🎨 セクション 29

What manual process is always breaking or causing frustration? Just listen for the signs. Listen for the complaints. That is where the gold is going to be for you. And the goal here is to identify probably a handful.

### 🚀 セクション 30

I'd recommend three to five of these common bottlenecks and start writing them down and keep a list of them. Step two is to research the solution for these problems. This is where you need to use your new AI research skills and you take those three to five problems that you identified and you go to YouTube, perplexity or Google with prompts like how to automate client onboarding with AI or AI tools for summarizing meeting notes, how to automate invoicing with AI. The goal here isn't to become an expert overnight. It's just to see what's possible.

### ⚡ セクション 31

You're gathering intelligence on potential solutions for each of the problems that you found. Step three is to choose your target. Now that you have a list of problems and a list of the potential solutions, you just need to pick one. And the sweet spot for this is a problem that is high impact for the team but low to medium complexity for you to build. So don't try to bite off more than you can chew.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Just pick the one that excites you the most and feels achievable with your current skills or with skills that you're confident that you'll learn in this month. So this is your project, the one that you've identified here. And step four is to build that bridge and expand your powers. This is really the most important part of phase two. This is where you start to expand your AI journalist toolkit.

### 🎬 セクション 33

If you've mastered the power to create in phase one, the solution for your team's problem might require you to now learn the basics of the power to automate or the power to build. This is where you'd start learning a tool like make.com or relevance AI to build some kind of simple workflow. Or maybe the best solution is a simple app to help the team track something. This is where you'd start learning the power to build with no code tools like Bolt, Lovable or Replet Agent. So don't see this part as a chore.

### 📋 セクション 34

You need to be grateful and excited for this challenge of learning a new power. And just remember that each new power you acquire makes you exponentially more valuable. you are actively moving towards becoming an AI generalist. And at the end of 60 days, you will have two things. Firstly, a working prototype for your tool or automation.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And secondly, a simple one-page document. And this document shows the before, the old manual process, and the after, your new and AI powered solution to solve this issue. And most importantly, it will have a conservative estimate of the time saved for the team. So this document is your key. It's what you're going to use to unlock the final phase of your transformation.

### 📝 セクション 36

So you've made it to the final phase. You have mastered your domain. you have solved a real problem for your team. And this is the final and crucial step. It's not about building more.

### 💡 セクション 37

It's about communicating the value of what you've built and positioning yourself as a strategic guide within your organization. This is how you get pulled in, like Naval said, not pushed out. And here are the three steps to make that happen. Step one is showing, not telling. You need to take that onepage document you created in phase two and present it to your manager in your next oneonone.

### 🔧 セクション 38

You need to frame it simply. You're not asking for a raise or promotion at this point. You're just demonstrating proactive value. You say, "Hey, I've used some of my free time to build this little tool to solve a reporting bottleneck, and now it's saving the team about four hours a week. I just wanted to show you." And step two is to become a teacher.

### 🎯 セクション 39

A few days after you've shown your manager, offer to do a 15-minute lunch and learn for your team. Here, you're going to show them how the tool works or share a few of the AI tricks you've learned back in phase one. And this is going to be a subtle but powerful move. You're going to be now the go-to person for the AI question within your department. And you've essentially established yourself as the internal expert on the team.

### 💭 セクション 40

Step three is to propose the next project. So, this is all like the 4D chess, the the checkmate move. Because after you've demonstrated value and established your expertise, you can go back to your boss and say this, like, "Hey, that little project was a success, but I've been talking to the sales team and they have a similar bottleneck with prospect research that's costing them way more time. I think I could build a similar solution for them. Can I maybe spend 10% of my time next month leading a pilot project here?" At this moment, you're no longer just a marketer or a sales rep or a HR professional.

### 📌 セクション 41

You are an internal AI consultant, an AI champion. And you are a strategic asset and I can tell you from firsthand experience, these people are irreplaceable in the companies that we work with. And as Navar Raakan said, you are making them pull you into a new and more valuable role in the company. So that is the 90-day plan, a clear path from feeling anxious about AI and how it's going to affect your job to becoming an indispensable champion in your company. And I know this may sound hard and like there's all these skills and automate and build and all this stuff.

### ✅ セクション 42

You just need to like seriously throw those doubts out the window. I have seen hundreds of thousands of people now through this channel, through my free community, everything that I've done in the AI space over the past 2 and a half years has shown me that anyone can learn this stuff. And if you want to put up your own barriers and say, "Oh, I can't do it for this and that." And I'm sorry, but someone else is going to do this and they're going to be the AI champion and they're going to be the one who doesn't get let go. So that's the reality. The information is out there.

### 📚 セクション 43

All this stuff is low code, no code. There really is no excuse why you can't figure this stuff out now. And I promise you, it will feel uncomfortable. You will feel stupid for like the first 30 days to 60 days. But once you really get in there and you go through that initial learning phase, before you know it, it starts to feel like second nature to you.

### 🔖 セクション 44

You go, "Oh yeah, I know I could I could connect that to that. Oh yeah, that I could build this little agent on relevance or I could use this image generation tool to do this." It just becomes flawed. It's just a gradual process and every single one of you can get there. But when you zoom out, this is all it's already a lot bigger than just your job. It's actually about using AI as the ultimate lever to build your dream life.

### 🎨 セクション 45

And to help you start off on day one, I have put everything you need inside my free school community. It's the world's largest AI community for people learning AI skills and building AI businesses.
