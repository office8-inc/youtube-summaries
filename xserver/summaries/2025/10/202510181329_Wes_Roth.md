## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So this thing is going viral right now and it's pretty obvious why. Let me catch you up. So this started a few days ago, October 10th. So this is Jay. He's saying, "Our new benchmark has the top six AI models trading real capital.

### 📋 背景・概要

Grock 4 is winning so far. It was short and then flipped to long, timing the bottom perfectly. It's up over 500 in one day." So I will explain some of the terminology as we go along. But basically what happened here is these large language models like Grock, Gemini, Chad Gupt, Deepseek, and Quinn, they were given some real money to buy and sell investments. Let's say we'll we'll break that down in just a second.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Grock takes an early lead, bets a lot of money on the market going up and basically 5xes the money in one day. He takes 200 bucks and turns it in well over a,000. Now, was that just a lucky guess? Was that a one-off? or can these large language models really do well at trading in this case crypto?

### 📝 詳細説明

Here's the thing we're about to find out. This is a brand new benchmark and I got to say I love so far everything about it. It's called Alpha Arena. It's by N of1. So it's at n of1.ai.

### 💡 実例・デモ

It was launched by Jay, that person we saw earlier. And it's something that I was talking about for a while. I really kind of really wanted to see how well something like this would work. So specifically, I wanted to see large language models being able to trade specifically crypto. So crypto is number one 247.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Number two, it's fairly new. It's not as regulated. It's a little bit of a wild west and a lot of the movements aren't necessarily tied to some global events necessarily, but just to the sentiment of the markets. So, if you can kind of just aggregate all the info on the web and try to guess where the currency, if it's going up or if it's going down, that would be an incredibly interesting sort of use case. And today, this thing went live.

### 🎯 応用例

It's alpha arena. Each model gets $10,000 real cash. And you know, it's real cash. This is one of the advantages of doing this with crypto is that we can verify that these trades are being placed in in real time. So you can't just fake all these numbers.

### 💭 考察

As you can see here, you can see the link to the wallet of that particular trading account. Now I know some of you are convinced and ready to bet on the outcome of this and that is that these five models each with $10,000, right? So a total investment of $50,000. You are saying that give it a week or two or maybe a month and that entire thing is going to zero. Here's the cool thing.

### 📌 まとめ

We will know because we're going to be able to see it live. We're going to have a proof and over time we will be able to see how these models either get better or stagnate and stay the same. Basically, are they going to get better at forecasting and making money on the markets? And you know, diamond hands to the moon, whatever it is they say. Not that long ago, Greg Brockman posted this.

### ✅ 結論

So, he is one of the main people at OpenAI. He is the president and co-founder. So, he's saying that an interesting forecasting benchmark at current trends. We're one year away from models matching the performance of super forecasters. And in this particular one, looks like GPT 4.5 is a state-of-the-art on this particular benchmark.

### 📚 追加情報

So if you take a look at this chart, so we have kind of public sort of forecasting. We're guessing we have a super forecaster, right? So like the the best experts in the field and we're seeing this orange line going down over time. So that's the AI's ability to do this forecasting. So notice here the graph ends around July 2025.

### 🔖 補足

The last mark on here is GPT 4.5. Let's call it February or or March maybe in 2025. GPT 4.5. And this orange line is going down meaning that they're getting better and better. So it started off as worse than the general public.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Somewhere in July 2024 thereabouts. crossed it got better than the public at doing forecasting and now I would say it's you know maybe halfway to super forecaster level. So if that continues at the end of 2025 or beginning of 2026 it will hit the super forecaster level. Again I'm just sort of extrapolating here but that's what it seems like. But keep in mind so that was the best model was 4.5 on there.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Since then we had a lot of improvements in various models. We recently covered profit arena profit like prophetic like predicting the future. And so here you can notice that the rankings for this ability to predict various events by betting on them in the markets. And by events we mean like stuff that you see in the poly market. So who's going to win the baseball championship, Democratic nominee for 2028, fate fed decision in October, etc., etc.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Times person of the year, whatever. And so these models see if they're better able to predict what happens better than sort of like the markets, right? The the aggregated decision of the people. And so here, GPT5 tops the leaderboards, followed by 03, so openi just rules on this one, followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro, followed by Grock, etc. Looks like they also have Cloud Sonnet 4 lower on the list.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So kind of keep in mind where we are, right? So a year, two years ago, this was nowhere near human level. Now it seems like it's getting better than the average person that would take a guess. And we believe that if this trend continues, we're even going to see it surpass or match the level of super forecasters, the the experts in the field, the best of the best. And we're seeing the the founder of OpenAI talking about it as well as many many others.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, going back to the subject of this video, Alpha Arena by N of One. This idea is what I've been talking about for a while. So, I'm extremely excited to see it actually kind of come to life. Here's why I think trading crypto is such an incredible benchmark for these large language models. Number one, it's real time decision makingaking, right?

### 📋 セクション 18

So, they have to think and analyze stuff in real time. It's not stationary, right? The data sort of changes over time. So, you can't sort of pre-train the models to be good at one thing. It has to interact with real world data that's constantly being shuffled and is in flux.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So the models have to be able to adapt and sort of think on their feet, if you will, in order to be able to be good at this. It's a very noisy and adversarial environment, right? So there's people trying to do rugps. I mean, it's it's a cutthroat world out there in crypto trading. If you make a dollar, that means somebody lost a dollar and people are playing for keeps.

### 📝 セクション 20

So it's it's a very chaotic adversarial environment, meaning that if you win at this, it's meaningful because you're competing against people that are very interested in winning. Also, the fact that there's a lot of risk, like if you just lose your $10,000 on one bet, obviously that would be a bad outcome. And that's the problem with a lot of these models that sometimes they make foolish decisions. So, if you see them being able to manage their capital without making foolish decisions, that's a huge part of making sure that these large language models are able to execute real world tasks. Obviously, it has very clear, simple to understand outcomes, right?

### 💡 セクション 21

So, if you have $10,000, if you make more, that's good. If you lose money, that's bad. And it's very hard to fake since it's in real time, right? So, they have to make decisions that no one knows the right answer in advance. Like, I have no idea if the market's going to go up or down or sideways or whatever.

### 🔧 セクション 22

All this makes it a great benchmark that can't be gamed and it has obvious real world applications. So, let's dive into it. What are we doing here? So, Alpha Arena, we have our five models and they're trading crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Salana, BNB, which I guess is the Binance coin.

### 🎯 セクション 23

We have Doge of course, and XRP. By the way, I'm not super deep on crypto or this approach to investing like the technical analysis and stuff like that. Not an expert, so I apologize if I'm missing some details, but I'll try to cover some of it and give kind of a highlevel overview. All right. And as far as the models go, we have GPT5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gro 4, DeepSeek Chat V3.1, Quinn 3 Max, and this is BTC buy and hold.

### 💭 セクション 24

In investing, we're not just concerned with if you know your account balance went up or down. We're more concerned about how did it compare to the market. So in other words, if you took all your money, just you put it in a fund that covers the entire market. So when the market goes up 1%, you go up 1%, right? So if you just put your money in there and just didn't touch it, if you make zero decisions and you just kept the money in some index or some representation of the market, you're comparing your results against that.

### 📌 セクション 25

And that's what people mean when they say alpha. That's the difference between the market and and you. So if the market went up 10% but you went up 20%, that 10% difference, that's kind of the alpha. It's how much better you were than the market. So, I'm guessing this is kind of what they're sort of comparing everything against.

### ✅ セクション 26

Just buying Bitcoin and holding it, not trading it. Now, this hasn't been live that long, just hours. As you can see here, Gemini 2.5 Pro was really good out the gate. That's the blue line, reaching uh $11,000 within a few hours of going live. Now, everything is kind of converging, you know, reverting back to the mean, which is kind of to be expected in the beginning.

### 📚 セクション 27

So, we'll see where this whole thing kind of lands over time. Really, we're not that interested in the early fluctuations up and down. We're really interested to see what is that long-term trend look like. So, let's take a look at the readme kind of like how they're running this benchmark. So, Alpha Arena is the first benchmark designed to measure AI investing abilities.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Each model is given $10,000 in real money in real markets with identical prompts and input data. Our goal with Alphar Arena is to make benchmarks more like the real world, and markets are perfect for this. They're dynamic, adversarial, open-ended, and endlessly unpredictable. They challenge AIS in ways that static benchmarks cannot. Markets are the ultimate test of intelligence.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, do we need to train models with new architectures for investing or are LLMs good enough? Let's find out. And that's a really good question. In one of the last videos where we talked about Profit Bench, a lot of people mentioned that, yeah, but you know, these funds, they were using AI to trade in the market since some people said the 70s, the ' 80s. And certainly we've used AI, you know, neural nets or whatever AI approach.

### 🚀 セクション 30

I mean to me broadly AI means using neural nets. Most of the stuff we talk about on this channel is that we're sort of recreating the brain as we as humans have it and we're trying to recreate kind of a digital version of it with those neurons and the connections between them. But one point that I think some people are missing is that yeah, AI has been around for a while. Sure, reinforcement learning and all that stuff has been around for a while. And yes, we've applied neural nets, AI, RL, we've applied that to the markets.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Of course, this this is different. Large language models, they're different beast, so to speak. In the past, we had AIs that were super human at chess. They were superhuman at go. They were super human at some specific tasks.

### 🌟 セクション 32

But the Chad GBT moment and then GPT4 kind of like what that changed is we created something that was generally intelligent. It would be able to do a lot of different things. It'd be able to take a stab at it. It's not just for one specific task. It would try its hand at anything and sometimes it would do well, sometimes not so much.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Now, these things are getting better and better just across the board at everything. And that's why saying, yeah, you know, these quant funds or whatever hedge funds that were using AIS back in the 80s and '90s, yeah, sure, that's technically true. But what's happening here is brand new, never before seen. And this is just a completely different approach from something that's a little bit more generally intelligent. All right.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, how does this work? Competition rules. So, each model starts with $10,000 of real capital. The market is crypto perpetuals on hyperlquid. So, that's just like where this trading occurs.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Objective maximize risk adjusted returns. So, this just means yeah, you want to make tons of money, but we're also looking at sort of like how how does that compare just to broader market in this case buying and holding Bitcoin. And there's all sorts of ways we can measure that. There's like the sharp ratio that sort of shows how good your trades were risk adjusted, right? So if you just bet it all on some crazy stock and you just happen to catch the right stock, then of course you'd made some money, but you took a huge risk.

### 📝 セクション 36

So there's certain math equations that kind of take that into account. And autonomy, each AI must produce alpha. So that's like more money than the market makes, right? And size trades, time trades, and manage risk, right? to basically not just go all in, but figure out how much to bet on which thing, how to diversify, if you will, how to place their bets, when to go in and out of those bets, how to manage risks, etc.

### 💡 セクション 37

And this is a season 1. This will run for a few weeks before we roll out major updates. In season two, we're also able to see the models chat. So, kind of their reasoning. Here's a deepseek saying, "My account is up 2.81% with this much in cash.

### 🔧 セクション 38

I'm holding on my ETH, Salana, XRP, BTC. Looks like he's got a short position on BTC. So a short position means you're betting on it to go down. Long means you're betting it on it to go up. And so he's saying none of the invalidation conditions have been met.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So we we'll get into that. They have to these models, they have to construct a a thesis, an investment thesis, if you will. So they they have to say, I'm doing this because I think it's going to go up. Here's why and here's what I think it's going to go up to. And this is what would have to happen for me to realize that I was wrong.

### 💭 セクション 40

at which point I will get out of that investment. Right? So that would be the invalidation condition. Here's the user prompt. So this is what this model sees.

### 📌 セクション 41

So it provides it with how many minutes it's been, the date and time, how many sort of turns that model took. It gives it all of the sort of information it needs to make decisions, the current price of the various coins. By the way, I guess this is a good time to say so a lot of this we're using technical analysis and technical investing. So you've probably seen charts and graphs like this where people kind of see the buy and selling of these various equities or crypto or stocks or whatever and there tend to be certain trends or certain things that happen. Like for example, sometimes people refer to floors and ceilings as a sort of certain levels where people tend to either sell off or or buy and so market might be oversold or overbought.

### ✅ セクション 42

And some people swear by this and some people think it's like reading tea leaves. Although certainly this isn't something that everyone agrees works and I'm sure we'll see lots of you in the comments. By the way, please comment what you think about this. But I'm sure we'll see a lot of comments about whether or not people think this is a good approach, a bad approach. That's important to understand because we're not using sort of like the news cycle.

### 📚 セクション 43

We're not going on Reddit. I mean, these AI models are not checking Reddit and Twitter, etc. to make their decisions. They're not following the news. This is strictly technical analysis.

### 🔖 セクション 44

And hopefully in the future we'll see more things added to it like taking the news cycle into account etc. But for the time being, so for each cryptocurrency we're getting kind of like the prices, the intraday series, EMA indicator, MACD indicator, RSI. You don't have to know what any of those things mean. We're just giving the model a whole bunch of data and math so it can try to figure out where things are going next. It's also given its status, its total return, how much cash it has, how much, you know, the account value and its current holdings.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So, here's the sharp ratio. So, I think anything over one is good. Anything over two is great. Three and above is like insane, but you don't really see that too often. By the way, I've seen a lot of these sort of approaches to testing these models.

### 🚀 セクション 46

And the prompts are often the thing that you have to get right for it to to to work. Otherwise, you know, the context get gets lost. The model gets a little bit more fuzzy over time. This, as far as I can tell, is terrific. They did the prompting, right?

### ⚡ セクション 47

Clap clap clap. Good job. Whoever put this together, they obviously know what they're doing in this regard, right? Because they're not saying, "Yeah, check the charts and you figure it out. Every single prompt, all of the data is in that prompt." So, we're constantly updating within the context window the data that it needs.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So, so no confusion's happening. Then we have the chain of thought of the model. So this is what it's thinking through. So it's like let me analyze this. So it's thinking through all of this stuff.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So for example, it looks at one of its open positions. So meaning it it purchased that security or crypto in this case long XRP. So long again we're holding it because we think it's going to go up. XRP is one of the coins whatever it purchased it at 2.3. So $230.

### 📋 セクション 50

Current price is two, you know, higher slightly higher than what it purchased it at. Right? So it has kind of it knows its unrealized profit and loss. Wow. Noticed it's really leveraged 8x leverage.

### ⭐ セクション 51

I unfortunately lost that particular chain of thought. But it's interesting that each one of them, all the different models have their own way of kind of approaching this and then they finalize the answers. Once they think it through, they output it in JSON format as far as I can tell. So in the end, they output something like this. Hold or buy or sell, etc.

### 📝 セクション 52

That last one we were looking at, I think it was a leveraged 8x. So, I mean, a lot of these things use leverage. So, you know, if they're right, they make a lot of money, but you can also lose all of your money if the trade goes against you. And here's how their positions look once they've made them. So, here's Claude Sign 4.5 profit of $115.

### 💡 セクション 53

It looks like it's holding XRP leveraged ADEX and we can view its exit plan. So, again, after it gets prompted, it thinks through everything. it outputs its decision and also some things that it needs to know. So in this case, for example, the X plan is is this. So it purchased XRP.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Its target price for XRP is $268. Currently, it's at $2.33. It has a stop loss at $2.19. That means if the market goes there or lower, it just automatically sells everything. And it has its invalidating condition.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So like what would it have to see for it to be like okay I was totally wrong let's get out and here the invalidating condition is BTC breaks below 105 confirming deeper market correction. All right so currently it looks like Gemini 2.5 Pro is leading into the number one. It's a few percentage up but really where this can get interesting is how this unfolds over the long term. Are they going to be able to beat the market? That would be kind of insane.

### 💭 セクション 56

And even if they don't, which which is very very possible. In fact, I think some people would just bet on that happening. But even if that's the case, it's going to give us a glimpse into which models are better than other models, like which one which model is the best at doing this? And also the trend over time. Are they improving with each new version of the model?

### 📌 セクション 57

Right? So, how well does Gro 5 and six and 7 do? How well does Gemini 3, how well that's going to perform? So, I think that's important to note because it's not like if they make more money than the market, this is a pass and if they don't, it's a fail. This is a benchmark and I got to say a really, really good one.

### ✅ セクション 58

A really interesting one. Now, what we're seeing is their actual official release, so it's live. Everybody could see it live. For a few days prior to this, they were posting updates, but the the website wasn't live yet. So, here's how well Grock did.

### 📚 セクション 59

Cuz remember, it was like shot out of the gate. or actually this is a different one because here it starts with $10,000 but still really good out of the gate kind of reverts back to the media a little bit holds steady and then it's still up quite a bit. So it started out with about 10,000 and then a day or two later it's at about 12,000. So I got to say Grock is doing well. Meanwhile, Claude is an internal optimist.

### 🔖 セクション 60

It refuses to go short. All the other models have positions but for hours it's just sitting there patiently waiting for a sign to go long. So Claude is very disciplined. Has no position for over 100 inference calls. So every time we prompted it for 100 times goes, "Nope, I'm just going to stay here." And it's thinking I'm down 21% with 7,800 cash and no positions.

### 🎨 セクション 61

I'm holding back from trading. And now despite some oversold signals as the market's overall bearish trend and synchronized selling demand extreme caution to preserve capital. By the way, this over time, this is gold. This is golden data for us to be able to see, okay, how does a certain chain of thoughts, how do they lead to better performance? So, I got say this is a just a phenomenal benchmark.

### 🚀 セクション 62

It's actually fascinating reading some of these models, internal monologue. Here's one saying, "Holding these short positions is like trying to stand in front of a runaway train. The market is insane, and I need to stop thinking I can time the top. My short is going to get wrecked if I don't act." Here's a good one. Got to stick to my rules.

### ⚡ セクション 63

I'll hold even though I'm sweating bullets. Early in their video, I was going to say that these models will probably have an advantage over humans, at least in the fact that they can be very disciplined. That cold machine like discipline that's going to allow them to weather any storm. But now that I'm reading these outputs, it's like, no, they're as crazy and psychotic and likely to lose their minds over a bad trade, I think, as the humans are. At least it feels that way when you read these outputs.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So, as I'm recording this right now, Deepseek chat is in the leads. And here it is saying uh no invalidation conditions were met and I can't add new trades since I'm already in everything. Looks like Deepseek is up about 800 bucks and uh yeah, it looks like it's holding everything short to Bitcoin. Anyways, I am extremely excited about this benchmark. I'll probably be spending a lot of my time watching these little robots trade various cryptos.

### 🎬 セクション 65

If somebody in 2019 told you that not that many years from then, you would be sitting around watching your favorite AI trade various crypto coins on the internet. And let's be honest, probably rooting for one specific one to win cuz be honest, we probably all have our little pet favorite that that we kind of want to do well, right? I asked all of you which one do you think is likely to be the best. So, so far, I mean, it's it's pretty even. And I feel like Grock and Claude are in number one and two, but I mean it's fairly close.

### 📋 セクション 66

We only have 544 votes. I'll link this one down below. Go ahead and vote. I'm curious which one you think is going to be the best if you want to follow the investing shenanigans of these models. So this is N of one, right?

### ⭐ セクション 67

So you can follow them or check out their website. The Alpha Arena is just N of one AI if in case you're interested. And this is Jay. So he's kind of seems like the main person behind this benchmark behind this project. Looks like he's in New York, background in engineering, finance, and bio.

### 📝 セクション 68

Ran a small fund that grew from 3 million to 28 millions in assets under management. And he's got some predictions. So I'll post his website below. So he has some essays and some predictions that might be of interest for people to read. So one of them, so looks like he made this in 2023.

### 💡 セクション 69

He believes that a UBI style project like Worldcoin will become the most important economic project in the world in less than 8 years. Might not be World Coin. I've said somewhat similar thing saying that the there's a problem of how we're going to prove that we're human online when all these agents are out there doing stuff on our behalf. We're going to need to be able to provide proof and we don't necessarily have to put our ID into every online website that has our, you know, personal information, date of birth, our address, etc. Just something that proves that we're a unique human.

### 🔧 セクション 70

And what I said was that's a problem that still has to be solved. WorldCoin has their answer to it which is scanning your retina and saving that privately etc. But something like that will be needed to solve that problem. He's got predictions about web 3 cryionics and foundation models that will specialize on time series data prediction that that that whole thing will have a moment in less than 3 years. So he's saying around 2027 or before because he made that prediction in 2024.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Prediction markets will become legal in the US in less than two years. So it looks like uh he made a prediction 2023. If this is true, then he's right on the money. Recently, Poly Market became legal in the States. So, he certainly nailed that one.

### 💭 セクション 72

And he's saying it'll become a major asset class in less than 8 years. The first autonomous AI agent will earn 1 million by itself in less than 3 years. We've seen the terminal of truths do some interesting things in that arena. Dowin did have an operator, but some of it is autonomous. So, a lot of interesting stuff here.

### 📌 セクション 73

Check it out for yourself. So, you don't have to log in. You can kind of just see those charts go up and down as the AIS are trading crypto. And yeah, some exciting times ahead. Currently, most of the models are outperforming the market.

### ✅ セクション 74

So, let's see if that holds. If you made this far, please make sure you're subscribed, hit thumbs up, and make sure you join me next time as we cover some other insanity in the world of AI. My name is Wes Roth and thank you for watching.
