## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Testing, testing, testing the microphone. Welcome everybody. Today is Dev Day 2025 OpenAI and they're going to be starting in just about 20 minutes here. So, let me just make sure everything is working. I apologize for the delays.

### 📋 背景・概要

I pushed it back five minutes and then another five minutes. And um the reason for that is I don't know if there's a name for this law, but it's when you're trying to do something live like a live demo or a live stream, the chances of stuff going wrong increases dramatically. I don't know why that is. So my camera that I had, the the nice one, the 4K one, has always been um very reliable. It failed twice.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

The first time, well, the second time was this morning. I don't know why. It works when I open it up with camera mode and it does not work when I try to use it for live streaming. Never happened before. The second or well, the first time it actually failed me was when uh the first time when we were interviewing Dr.

### 📝 詳細説明

Dr. Mike Israel. And I was a little bit nervous about that interview because he's a huge sort of presence online. And of course that microphone failed that morning. Not microphone, sorry, the camera.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Yeah. Murphy's law. But this is like a a subsection of the Murphy's law. I think that's specifically for tech and live demos. um you know it happened with Mark Zuckerberg recently with with the um with the glasses announcement.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I guess they said the reason it happened is when they were doing the live stream when they said okay you know let's let's do this demo that activated all the other headsets that the audience was wearing and since they were running it from like a test server so like hundreds of those devices connected and tried to you know uh uh request from the server completely crashing everything. So it was hacked. Do you mean the the meta thing? So sad's law in the UK. Okay, that's interesting.

### 🎯 応用例

Okay, so there's a name for it in the UK. That's interesting. Sad's law. Yeah. Win some hacks.

### 💭 考察

Um, you'd rather watch this official live stream because there's no chat there. Boring. Yeah, there's definitely a contrast between what's happening there uh with no chat and what's happening here in the chat. Uh like there's uh this chat is an animal sometimes, especially if there's somebody that I don't know, every once in a while people in this chat like latch on to somebody who's presenting a certain way or saying certain things during the live streams and just like rip into them. Um, which is, you know, very disrespectful, but also sometimes hilarious.

### 📌 まとめ

When start 20 minutes, uh, let's see, 16 minutes till go go go time. Femil Bassment Dweller, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate you. Um let's see. Yeah, people are asking what do we expect?

### ✅ 結論

What do you think is going to happen? You know, I am like confused. So, it can't just be PR things for dev day, dev day. This has to be some something big. Do I need water?

### 📚 追加情報

my my I'm testing a a new setup for everything and the microphone is the camera is new as well, but I rearranged testing testing testing. So yeah, so I just wanted to um get everything running and ahead of time just in case we have any issues or anything like that, which I'm glad I did because we did I I did have issues. Let's see. All right, looking everything's looking good. So, let me organized get organized here.

### 🔖 補足

Okay. Yeah. So, so I just saw that there was a sod law basically means typical. Okay. Thank you, Norhold ninja.

### 🎨 セクション 13

I appreciate that. So, yeah. Um, today was the AMD announcement and uh it seems like AMD is just uh blowing up. Dang. Congratulations to anyone holding AMD, I guess.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Right. So, it was 33% up for the day. Um, I guess there was a deal with OpenAI. Some strange deal because they're also getting some percentage of AMD, it sounds like. I I haven't had a chance to really read through this, but something interesting is happening.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Testing, testing final's law. I think I I I saw somebody mention that if Sam is there, it's important. Yeah, generally when he shows up, it's something that's expected to be big. How is everybody enjoying Sora 2? Oh, yeah.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, where is everybody from? How many people do we have here in chat? I'm going to ask again later, but [Music] we got people from the UK. We got Yeah. Let me know where you guys are from.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Okay. So, yeah. So, I started answering what I think is going to happen. I have no idea. This is so weird because they announced so many big things.

### 📋 セクション 18

I mean, Sore 2. What else? Uh, I mean, there were so many big rollouts recently. So, it's like, what else? Okay, no sore in the EU.

### ⭐ セクション 19

We got people win some hacks. United Kingdom, Thorston Meyer, Germany, Athena, USA. Uh, Chitan Agarwal, India. 10:30 p.m. Okay, that's that's not too bad.

### 📝 セクション 20

Um, I remember I remember I think it was Grock 3 where they needed to they they were having the announcement late like 900 p.m. They kept getting delayed. So, I think I stayed up till like 3 in the morning like testing the stuff out. So, Am I here? Am I there now?

### 💡 セクション 21

No. So, I actually decided to not travel. Um, I'm going to be going to Vegas for these conventions. Uh, the Bay Area. I haven't been there for a while, but kind of I I need to start going.

### 🔧 セクション 22

I need to start uh meeting people over there and and checking places out. All right, we got Slovakia, New Jersey. Story 2 is just a glimpse of what the entire internet will become and nothing will be authentic over the internet. I wonder if it will it will also push some subsections to be a little bit more like authentic and people will care more about that because everything went I mean the internet already created this slop of everything. Uh cuz when it was just starting out like 0 you know 09 2010 2011 you had a lot more personal blogs and stuff like that like it was more about human connection individuals then the companies took over you know and in a lot of ways kind of diluted everything.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Maybe this will push to go back to you know interacting with people a little bit more one-on-one. I mean that's a little bit optimistic maybe naive but we'll see. Um, kind of hoping. Okay, so we have people from Latvia, Texas, Switzerland, Isa, Slovakia, Mars, the remarkable N coming live to us from Mars. Open eye is from China.

### 💭 セクション 24

coming coming to us from China, India, New Jersey, baby, Montreal, Canada. Emmanuel, yep, thank you for being here. Um, yeah, we talked to Maria Sha. She's from Montreal over there. Great great interview.

Yeah, Irvine was excellent. Thank you. Femell basement dweller. I love that name. Tricky Istanbul, Vienna, Austria.

### 💭 セクション 40

Who's closer to AGI this far, Open Eye or XAI? I can't wait for Elon to drop his new thing because there's defin definitely something something interesting that they're cooking up. So, he's talking about he's like GPT or Gro 5 might be AGI. So, it's going to be interesting to know exactly what they mean what he means by that. [Laughter] interesting.

### 📌 セクション 41

But um definitely there's something that they figured out with either just the scale of reinforcement learning compute that they're throwing at it or some specific training approaches. You you definitely see something happening there behind the scenes. Um, so we'll we'll see we'll see exactly what what it is when it come when it comes out. But Guanghu, China. Interesting.

### ✅ セクション 42

Um, Guanghu. I hope I'm saying that right. Neuralink waifu. Waifuss. Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 43

Let's see. Yeah. So, I have no idea what to expect, honestly. So, we saw the deal with AMD. I mean, we saw Sora recently.

### 🔖 セクション 44

We saw GPT5 not that long ago. So, I mean, what could they possibly be putting out here? It's going to be very interesting to see agent builder. Oh, okay. So, agent builder.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So, I would not be surprised if it's You know what? It's something like that, isn't it? It's Yeah. Okay, that sounds right. Is that what we're getting?

### 🚀 セクション 46

So, testing catalog news. Is this I don't know if this is OpenAI. It looks like their sort of UI. Yeah, it is. It is open.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So, this is somebody got Sounds like a leak that happened 7 hours ago. Did they announce that? Did I miss that? That they actually said what that thing is going to be. Yeah, please people subscribe.

### 🌟 セクション 48

I feel like as as I'm approaching 300,000 subscribers, it's like just like some limit of some sort where it's like, nope. this far you have come but you shall go no further like it just doesn't let me get past that line. I don't know why um there was a actually let me stop talking for a second and let me test out to make sure that the sound is good because the stream is starting in about 3 minutes. [Music] I had a lot of emotional stuff happen to me in that second deployment. You know, my my idol, Matty Roberts, I've talked about him a couple times.

### 🎬 セクション 49

I really really hung on to that dude. Like, he was my true north. He was the guy. And when he got shot up, when you see it happen, you know, I think that was the uh the closest call for fire mission the entire Iraq war, like inside a 15 m. I mean, Cordy Mike AC130 gunship.

### 📋 セクション 50

I mean, all right. Sorry, I just needed to test. Yeah, you shall not pass. Yeah, sorry. I just needed to test the um the sound how the sound quality is going to be.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So everything's looking good so far and it's going to be starting in just a few minutes here. So sounds like we're um expecting some sort of an agentic agent builder. So it's definitely going to be interesting. Workflow builder. Yeah.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, Donut Raider is you're in the Philippines. Interesting. I did not know you were in the Philippines. Um, are you traveling or that's where you live? [Music] Is it alternative of N8N?

### 💡 セクション 53

Um, yeah. interesting. So, we're going to have to kind of see because I mean there was a number of things that N8N and um I mean make.com was similar. What's the other one? Zapier was somewhat similar.

### 🔧 セクション 54

I feel like the idea of like an a builder like a uh workflow builder, but we'll see. Anyone [Music] from office entire? Yeah, I bet we have a few people from there. It's not too too far. Cincinnati, Ohio.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Netherlands. Have I experimented with agent builders? I mean, a little bit with I mean, I've used make and zap year and stuff like that. Um, and in fact, I mean, I've had a few workflows that were like really saved me a lot of time. So those things are incredibly powerful.

### 💭 セクション 56

Can you put your cam on the other side of the stream? YouTube TV has chat on right side. Oh, that's interesting. I did not even think about that because yeah, it does. Let me do this.

### 📌 セクション 57

Yeah. Okay. Thank you for Yeah. Thank you for mentioning that. I didn't think about it because it does pop up on certain devices just as an overlay from the right side, right?

### ✅ セクション 58

So, it doesn't just push everything over. It actually does it over. Very, very cool. Thank you for letting me know. All right, let me see what's happening.

### 📚 セクション 59

Let me tweet and get some people in here hopefully. [Music] Now, it's weird. Uh yeah, it's um I always like having the end of this thing towards the, you know, the wall, the edge, but eh Gro is going to be very interesting when the Grock 5 comes out. I would not ex I would not be surprised if it's something just next level. There's He's on to something.

### 🔖 セクション 60

And uh yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what what he pulls out. Um, are they going to address the censorship for Sora 2? Man, the first 24 hours there was like no censorship. The model would not really refuse too many things. It would do all sorts of third-p partyy content like just whatever you wanted, whatever characters you wanted.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Man, it was beautiful. And then right about 24 hours in by I think the next day it started refusing a lot of prompts um and all that stuff. So all right we might be beginning any minute. So it's 11:03. I mean technically this is the live stream has started because this is some sort of a introduction that they're doing for it but [Music] [Music] Oh, they're saying on next they'll be a few minutes late.

### 🚀 セクション 62

[Music] [Music] Mr. Intens, uh, thank you so much for, yeah, following and thank you. Yeah, you uh an as an AI researcher. Yeah, thank you for doing what you do. That's important work right now.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Hey, Cole. Well, hello. Hello. Thank you for joining. Long time no chat.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Welcome. Welcome. Am I AFK? What do you mean? I'm here.

### 🎬 セクション 65

I am here present reporting for duty. Um, come on, Sama. You're late. Tor, welcome. Welcome.

### 📋 セクション 66

I have not sent out my invite code yet. Uh, I'll see if I have So, I I have one invite code left. Um, I don't know if they refill. Hopefully, I I wish they would like refill it a little bit. Greetings for Poland.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Thank you. Thank you, Cole. Uh, I'm thinking just based on kind of like what people are saying and I I wasn't sure, but um what am I expecting? An agent builder. That's what it seems like.

### 📝 セクション 68

A few people mentioned it. I looked it up and um it's like I would not be surprised. I think that's exactly what it is. It's an agent builder, some sort of a like an N8 n agentic workflow type type of thing. There's some screenshots that's are that are floating online.

### 💡 セクション 69

So, I'm curious. I mean, it definitely seems like that's something that they would put out. And I'm kind of excited, especially if it's like an easy interface that everyone can use. What time does it kick off? They're running late.

### 🔧 セクション 70

It's supposed to have been kicked off already. [Music] Oh, I mean my when I'm looking at the stream, it's like right there. That's right. Now I'm I have one of those big monitors. So, if I'm looking this way, that's me reading chat.

### 🎯 セクション 71

So, chat, you're over there. And this is the live stream over here. So, this is just me looking at the live stream. This is me looking at chat. So, I'll be kind of um looking back and forth.

### 💭 セクション 72

Sore 3 Endgame. Oh, yeah. 11 Labs just dropped their agent builder a few hours ago. Oh, Adrien, I'm sorry if did I miss No, no, Adrian. Yeah.

### 📌 セクション 73

No, what's up? I'm sorry if I missed anything. Sorry. I'm like, uh, what did I miss? I am a little bit tired this morning.

### ✅ セクション 74

I'm not going to lie. I've uh feel like I've I've last couple days been a little bit Oh, has Plinny jailbroke it yet? Uh, I'm trying to talk to Plenny at some point because there's going to be a competition that I can't talk to can't talk about quite yet, but it involves um, it involves large language models and I've been meaning to see if I can do an experiment with with Ply's help. I mean, he posts everything I feel like most of the stuff that he finds online. Um, yeah, Adrian, I'm sorry if I if I missed it.

### 📚 セクション 75

I did not do it on purpose. I am somewhat a little bit out of it. So, uh, Femell is asking, do you think it would make sense to focus on creating games or useful apps right now? That's a great question. Um, so what's interesting is this morning Elon Musk said that they're going to be publishing a game within this year.

### 🔖 セクション 76

So by the end of the year, so they got a few months left. So XAI will publish a game, a video game I guess that's made with AI or assisted with AI. Thank you, Cole. Um, [Music] and uh, yeah, do we build apps or do we build games? I feel like I feel like for games, we're very close hopefully to where it integrates with the actual game building systems a little bit better.

### 🎨 セクション 77

So, I mean, like, I feel like there's one step that's still missing. We interviewed a few people that are building games. They're they're great games. Um, but I feel like at some point you're going to have something that allows you to build. I mean, a few recent games that came out there were great.

### 🚀 セクション 78

I mean, uh, Batro was huge. That I think that was a single developer. Schedule one was huge. That was a single developer. And recently, what's the game that's blowing up?

### ⚡ セクション 79

Um, Mega Bonk, I guess. Um, oh, he said by the end of 2026, not by the end of this this year. I thought that was Oh, I misread that. I'm sorry, guys. Okay, so Elon Elon said XAI game studio will release a great AI generated game before the end of next year.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Thank you. Okay. Okay. I thought that was very strange how quickly Yeah, I was surprised that I I must have misread it. So, let's see.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Let's see. Yeah, I think we're almost there. It's going to start very, very soon. Uh-oh. The snake ate itself.

### 📋 セクション 82

All right. All right. Let's go. >> Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Devday.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Thanks for being here in San Francisco, the city where we started and where we are committed to building the future of AI. It's been almost 2 years since our first Devday. We, but most importantly, all of you have come a long way since then. Back in 2023, we had 2 million weekly developers and 100 million weekly CHBT users. We are processing about 300 million tokens per minute on our API and that felt like a lot to us at least at the time.

### 📝 セクション 84

Today 4 million developers have built with open AI. More than 800 people use chatbt every week and we process over 6 billion tokens per minute on the API thanks to all of you. AI has gone from something people build play with to something people build with every day. Before we get started with all of today's announcements, we want to do something fun. On the screen behind me are the names of the developers in the room who have built apps on our platforms that have crossed some big milestones.

### 💡 セクション 85

10 billion tokens processed, 100 billion, even 1 trillion. Let's give them a round of applause. [Applause] On behalf of all of us at OpenAI, thank you for doing such incredible work. You are the ones pushing the future forward and seeing what you've already done makes us so excited about what comes next. While it's exciting to celebrate how far you all have come, we are still so early on this journey.

### 🔧 セクション 86

So today, we're going to focus on what matters most to you all, which is making it easier to build with AI. We've been listening to developers, hearing where you get stuck, what you want us to build next, so that you can build more things. We've got four things for you today. We're going to show you how we're making it possible to build apps inside of ChatBT and how we can help you get a lot of distribution. We're going to show you how building agents is going to be much faster and better.

### 🎯 セクション 87

You'll see how we're making it easier to write software, taking on the repetitive parts of coding so you can focus on systems and creativity. And underneath all of this, we'll give you updates to models and APIs to support everything you want to build. We think this is the best time in history to be a builder. It has never been faster to go from idea to product. You can really feel the acceleration at this point.

### 💭 セクション 88

So to get started, let's take a look at apps inside of chatbt. We want chatbt to be a great way for people to make progress, to be more productive, more inventive, to learn faster, to do whatever they're trying to do in their lives better. We have been continuously amazed by the creative ways that people use it. Since our first dev day, we've been working to try to figure out how to open up chatb to developers. And we've tried things like GPTs.

### 📌 セクション 89

We've adopted standards like MCPS. And we've made it possible for developers to connect ChachiBt to more and more applications. Some of the stuff has worked, some of it hasn't, but we've learned a lot along the way. And today, we're going to open up ChachiBt for developers to build real apps inside of Chachib. This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized that you can chat with.

### ✅ セクション 90

So to build them today, we're launching the apps SDK, which will be available in preview starting today. With the apps SDK, you get the full stack. You can connect your data, trigger actions, render a fully interactive UI, and more. The apps SDK is built on MCP. You get full control over your backend logic and front-end UI.

### 📚 セクション 91

We've published the standard so that anyone can integrate the apps SDK. When you build with the apps SDK, your apps can reach hundreds of millions of chatbt users. We hope this will be a big deal for helping developers rapidly scale products. Thank you. You're welcome.

### 🔖 セクション 92

Um, if a user has already subscribed to your existing product, they'll be able to log in right from the conversation. And in the future, we're going to support many ways to monetize, including the new Agentic commerce protocol that offers instant checkout right inside of ChateBT. So let's take a look at a few examples. When someone's using chatbt, you'll be able to find an app by asking for it by name. For example, you could sketch out a product flow for ChateBT and then say, "Figma, turn the sketch into a workable diagram." The Figma app will take over respond and complete the action.

### 🎨 セクション 93

You can also then launch Fig Jam from Chachebt if you want to iterate further. We're also making apps discoverable right in the conversation. So when a user asks for something, we can surface a relevant app as a recommendation. Maybe a user says they need a playlist for their party this weekend. Chachi Boutique could then recommend building it in Spotify.

### 🚀 セクション 94

It's an easy way to find the right app or have the right app presented to you at the right time. And there will be a whole bunch of new ways for developers to get discovered. So now rather than just talk about this, I'd like to invite Alexi to the stage and we will show you a live demo. Hi, I'm Alexi, a software engineer on chatbt working on apps SDK. I'm super excited to showcase some of the first apps users will be able to interact with today.

### ⚡ セクション 95

The magic of these apps is combining their rich interactive visuals with the power of chatbt. Let's start with Corsera. Let's say I don't spend enough time thinking about machine learning at work and I want to learn more. I can I can ask the Corsera app in chat GBT to help me learn more about this. I can say Corsera, can you teach me something about machine learning?

### 🌟 セクション 96

Since this is my first time using Corsera in chatbt, I'll need to consent to connect. The next time I use it, I'll be able to dive in immediately. You'll notice I asked chatbt for the Corsera app directly, but chatbt can also suggest apps if relevant to the conversation. Apps and chatbt by default are displayed in line and can support anything that you can render on the web like this video shown here. Apps SDK also supports picturein picture or expanding to a full screen layout.

### 🎬 セクション 97

So, now that I have my course up, let's play the video. Playing the video immediately pins it to the top of my screen, which is really helpful for something like Corsera because you can access your conversation while watching the video. Let's skip ahead a little bit and say I want to go a little bit deeper on something mentioned in the video. I can ask, can you explain more about what they're saying right now? Apps SDK provides an API to expose context back to chatbt from your app, ensuring that the model always knows about exactly what your user is interacting with.

### 📋 セクション 98

We're calling it talking to apps. And it's really part of the magic here. I'm super excited about how learning with ChatBT, one of our top use cases, is continuing to get better. And with apps and the apps SDK, you can unlock richer educational experiences for users around the world. So here chatbt responded and explained that the instructor is talking about data preparation steps before training a machine learning model and then it breaks it down in simple terms for me.

### ⭐ セクション 99

I don't need to explain what I'm seeing in the video. Chatbt sees it right away. So here I was able to connect to Corsair's app, discover, start playing a course and directly engage with the video through text all within my existing chatbt conversation. Pretty cool. Users also love being creative in chatb.

### 📝 セクション 100

Here I have a conversation where I've been brainstorming some ideas to help my younger siblings dog walking business. We've gone back and forth a few times and now it's time to make this into a reality. I'm pretty happy with some of the names here. Uh so let's let's take this walk this wag name and now I'm going to ask Canva to turn that into a poster. I can say, "Canva, can you make me a poster with the walk this wag?

### 💡 セクション 101

I want it to be colorful, whimsical, bright, and I prefer Oops. I asked Corsera for a typing course, too, maybe. Um, I prefer sans serif fonts." Cool. Send that off. And now in the background, Canva is generating posters based on the context from my conversation.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Canva is great at creating assets like this. And now you can kick it off directly from chatbt. Whether you're making professional marketing assets for OpenAI or just a fun demo for dev day, Canva is right there in the conversation as you work. Apps SDK, as Sam mentioned, is built on MCP, an open standard we've loved building on at OpenAI. And if you have an existing MCP, it's really quick to enhance it with the app's SDK.

### 🎯 セクション 103

All you have to do is add a resource that returns HTML and the app would be able to be up everywhere. Chat GBT is distributed across web and mobile. As you can see, this is a live demo, so we're experiencing a little bit of latency, but here we go. Canva has returned four poster examples to us. We see them in line just like the Corsera video as well as chatbt kind of explaining what it's done for us.

### 💭 セクション 104

But we can explore another modality in apps SDK which is full screen. I click an asset and the app requests full screen. We were able to focus on a specific asset and from here I can see it in more detail. I can ask Catchbt to request changes, maybe visual tweaks just like with our image generation experience. But since we're in San Francisco and it's dev day, let's ask Canva to convert this into a pitch deck.

### 📌 セクション 105

I can say, "Canva, can you please make this poster into a pitch deck? We're trying to raise a seed round for dog walking." I'll send that off. And since now Campbell is going to make us a couple of slide decks, it may take a moment. So, in the interest of time, we'll move on to show one more demo while that loads. Say the dog walking business is going really well and we want to expand to another city.

### ✅ セクション 106

I can ask chatbt based on our conversations, what would be a good city to expand the dog walking to. Chatt of course knows what we've been talking about. Super enthusiastically says Pittsburgh. Great. Now I can invoke the Zillow app to say please show me some homes for sale there.

### 📚 セクション 107

And now chatbt is talking to Zillow to fetch the latest housing data and we'll get a interactive map embedded in chatbt and we'll explore how the full screen experience there goes. So we have our map gorgeous loading state and boom, we have a bunch of homes here. [Applause] It also looks like our slide decks are done. So, we'll go back to those in a moment. But this map is a little hard to see in the inline view.

### 🔖 セクション 108

So, I can click a specific home and open it full screen. And now we have most of the Zillow experience embedded in chatbt. You can request a tour. All the actions that you would expect from Zillow. But we have a lot of options here and it's kind of hard to parse.

### 🎨 セクション 109

So I can ask chatbt, can you filter this to just be threebedroom homes with a yard for the dog? Of course, chatbt will talk to Zillow again. And because the app is in full screen, it can now just update the data that's provided to it without needing to create a new instance. We see chatbt came back. We get the message overlay here.

### 🚀 セクション 110

If I click that, I can view my conversation over the Zillow app and even open it to the full height. Cool. Let's zoom in and find a specific home we may be interested in. Now, because the Zillow app is exposing context back to CHP, it knows what I'm looking at. I can ask for more information about this home, like how close is this to a dog park.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Chacht is able to compose the context from Zillow with other tools at its disposal, like search. So, it's able to give more information about this home. From here, I could invoke other Zillow tools, maybe find out the affordability of it, but it'll provide the best answer every time. This is a great example of how dynamic an experience with apps SDK can be. This all started from an inline map and now we're able to go back and forth between talking to the app, asking Chatbt questions, or just using the Zillow experience.

### 🌟 セクション 112

Let's check back in on those slide decks. So, if I pop back over into this conversation, see Canva has given us a few options here. Like the look of this blue. So, if we open that up, we now see the slides in full screen and I can see all the beautiful slides that Canva has generated for me. When I'm ready, I can just like the posters, I could ask for follow-up edits.

### 🎬 セクション 113

And when I'm ready, I can open this in Canva to get the real slides out. and hopefully close the seed round. So there it is. The magic of apps and chatt conversations that unite the intelligence of chatbt with your favorite products resulting in truly novel experiences. I'm so excited to keep building this with all of you.

### 📋 セクション 114

Can't wait to see what you do with it. Now back to Sam for apps. That was awesome. Thanks, Lexi. That was great.

### ⭐ セクション 115

It's very hard to type and talk in front of a bunch of people at the same time. So, you did very well. Uh, we're excited for you to try out the apps that you saw in the demos along with a few more from these launch partners. They'll be available in chatbt today and this is just the beginning. We're going to roll out more apps from partners in the weeks ahead.

### 📝 セクション 116

For developers, the apps SDK is available in preview to start building with today. Our goal is to get this in your hands early, hear your feedback, build it together with you, and then later this year, developers will be able to submit apps for review and publication. We'll also release a directory that users can browse in addition to discovery and conversation. Any apps that meet the standards provided in our developer guidelines will be eligible to be listed. Apps that meet higher standards for design and functionality will get featured more prominently, including in the directory and suggested as apps and conversations.

### 💡 セクション 117

We've published a draft of the developer guidelines along with the apps SDK so you'll know what to expect and we'll share more in monetization from apps soon. We'd also love your feedback about what you'd want. This should be an exciting new chapter for developers and for chatbt users. So that was apps and we hope everyone loves it. Thank you.

### 🔧 セクション 118

So next we want to talk about building agents and how we're going to make this simpler and more effective. AI has moved in the last couple of years from systems that you can ask anything to to systems that you can ask to do anything for you. And we're starting to see this through agents software that can take on tasks with context, tools, and trust. But for all the excitement around agents and all the potential, very few are actually making it into production and into major use. It's hard to know where to start, what frameworks to use, and there's a lot of work.

### 🎯 セクション 119

There's orchestration, eval loops, connecting tools, building a good UI, and each of these layers adds a lot of complexity before you know what's really going to work. Clearly, there's a ton of energy and the opportunity is very real. So, we've talked to thousands of teams, many of them in this room, who are building agents to reimagine how work gets done. And we're we've asked what we can do to make agents much easier to build. So today we're going to launch something to help with that.

### 💭 セクション 120

The goal here is something for every builder that wants to go from idea to agent faster and easier. So we're excited to introduce a new thing called agent kit. Agent kit is a complete set of building blocks available in the open platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agentic workflows with way less friction. Our hope is that everyone from individual developers to large enterprises will get a lot of value from this and we'll talk about a few of the core capabilities now.

### 📌 セクション 121

So the first one is agent builder. This is a canvas to build agents. It's a fast visual way to design the logic steps, test the flows and ship ideas. It's built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use. So most of you who have used our platform before should be familiar with the foundation.

### ✅ セクション 122

The second thing is chatkit. We've heard this one loud and clear and we're making it easy to bring great chat experiences right into your own apps. You get a simple embeddible chat interface that you can make your own. You can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique. And you can see in the video here how chat can work across each agent node and call on tools to form the best response.

### 📚 セクション 123

And then finally, evals for agents. We're shipping new features dedicated to measuring the performance of agents. You get trace grading to help you understand agent decision step by step. You get data sets so you can assess individual agent nodes. You get automated prompt optimization.

### 🔖 セクション 124

And you can even now run emails on external models directly from the OpenAI platform. This is all the stuff that we wished we had when we were trying to build our first agents. And of course, agents need access to data. So with OpenAI's connector registry, you can securely connect agents to your internal tools and third party systems through an admin control panel while keeping everything safe and under your control. So let's look at a couple of examples.

### 🎨 セクション 125

Albertson's runs over 2,000 grocery stores across the US. More than 37 million people shop there each week. And each store is like its own little economy. managers have to make all these constant decisions, you know, tweaking this promotion or that product mix, resetting the displays, working with a bunch of vendors. It's like a lot of stuff.

### 🚀 セクション 126

So, Albertson's built an agent using agent kit. So, now imagine a situation where sales are unexpectedly down for ice cream, down 32%. Uh, before this would have kicked off a long process of reporting. There'd be spreadsheets and meetings, a lot of panic. They sell a lot of ice cream, very important to them.

### ⚡ セクション 127

Um, now an associate can just ask the agent what's going on. The agent will look at the full context of everything it can discover, seasonality, historical trends, external factors, and it'll give a recommendation. Maybe it's time to adjust the display or to run a local ad. So, let's take a look at another agent. HubSpot is a customer platform used by hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world.

### 🌟 セクション 128

And they used agent kit to improve the responses of breeze, their AI tool, using the custom responses widget. So in this example, a HubSpot customer called Lumaplants gets a question about why a plant is not doing so well in Arizona. It then uses the Breeze assistant to search its own knowledge base, look up local treatments for the state's low humidity, pulls in policy details, and puts everything together. It then offers multiple ideas and a recommendation. So this is how we imagine intelligence working across many different sources, all operating together to deliver smart, useful answers to customers.

### 🎬 セクション 129

And it's a great example of the thing that you can build with agent kit. We have a bunch of great agent launch partners that have already scaled agents using agent kit and it's available to everyone starting today. So let's do a live demo and I will pass it off to Christina. [Applause] Thanks Sam. Hi everyone.

### 📋 セクション 130

I'm Christina and I work on the team building agent kit. Today I want to show you how Agent Kit helps developers create agents faster than ever before. So you may have already seen our Devday website. It's the site here that all of you have access to and has everything about today's schedule. But right now it's just a static page.

### ⭐ セクション 131

What if it could actually help you navigate the day and point you to the sessions that are most relevant to you? We're open AI. We need to have AI in our Devday website. So that's what we're going to build together. an agent powered by Agent Kit deployed right here inside this site.

### 📝 セクション 132

And to make this interesting, I'm going to give myself eight minutes to build and ship an agent right here in front of you. You just heard how hard it is to build an agent. So, this is going to be a bit of a challenge and I'm going to start the clock now to keep me honest. We have a clock going. So, I'm starting in the workflow builder in the OpenAI platform.

### 💡 セクション 133

And instead of starting with code, we can actually wire nodes up visually. Agent Builder helps you model really complex workflows in an easy and visual way using the common patterns um that we've learned from building agents ourselves. So here on the left, we've already extracted the common building blocks. For example, tools like file search and MCP, guard rails, human in the loop, and other logical nodes. Today, I'm planning on building a workflow that uses two specialized agents.

### 🔧 セクション 134

The first will be a sessions agent which will return information about the schedule and the second will be a more generic dev information agent. So I'm starting off with a categorizing agent to just help route um and categorize the type of message coming in whether it's asking about a specific session or something more generic. And then I've added in an if else node to route behavior based on that classifier. Next I'll create the session agent. Here I'll drag and drop um an agent node.

### 🎯 セクション 135

I'll call this session agent. I'll give it the context um about kind of grabbing information about a session. And then I can add in various tools here. Today I already have um a doc with all the information about sessions. So I'll simply drop that in.

### 💭 セクション 136

Let's call this sessions and attach it. So this agent now has all the information needed to answer my questions. Um but showing the schedule should also be fun and visually interesting, not just plain text. So, I'll also create a widget for them. I'll head over to our widget builder.

### 📌 セクション 137

Um, here I could create a widget from scratch. I can browse the gallery to learn about other widgets and reuse them. But for today, I've actually already designed a widget for this use case. In this case, it's an onboarding session widget for froge, one of our dev day friends that you'll see around the venue who's holding a 101 onboarding session um in Golden Gate Park. So, we can simply download this and then head back over to our uh to our agent and just attach it in as I don't think I clicked download.

### ✅ セクション 138

So, let me go back and actually click the button download. There we go. Great. So, head over and attach it as an output format for the sessions agent that we just created. Drop that in.

### 📚 セクション 139

We can preview it to make sure we added in the right widget and everything looks ready to go. So this session agent is now done. Um, next I'll create the general dev day agent. So once again I'll drag in an agent node. Let's call this the dev day agent.

### 🔖 セクション 140

We'll once again give it some context about what it's doing. Um, and then we'll also make it speak in the style of froge just to make it really on brand with the day. Um, we'll add in a file again once again. So, we have a file with all of the information about the day. Call this dev day.

### 🎨 セクション 141

Attach it. This agent is ready to go as well. And we'll attach that here. Now, it looks like I have a couple more minutes, so let's add in some additional security with one of the pre-built guardrails. So, one of the most important things when building agents is being able to trust them.

### 🚀 セクション 142

And guardrails help you have that confidence, protecting against hallucinations, adding moderation, blocking PII. In this case, we already have um a couple pre-built guardrails. I'll turn one on for a PII. And then I'll just include name as well so I can easily verify its behavior. I'll attach this in to the beginning of the workflow to make sure Froge is really protected against PII.

### ⚡ セクション 143

And then I'll add in an additional agent to handle cases when um this information is passed in. So again, I'll make it speak in the style of froze to stay consistent and I'll remind it that um it cannot help with questions that contain sensitive information and remove kind of the context. Um great. So I think this workflow is ready to go. I can also configure um the output to determine what shows up to the end user.

### 🌟 セクション 144

In this case, I I can also turn off um file search sources if that is kind of more internal. Um and I think that's it. Let's test it out. I can preview this directly from um our agent builder. So here I can ask what session to attend to learn about building agents.

### 🎬 セクション 145

And I can see this message moving its way through that workflow we just created. Checking guardrail, categorizing intent, pulling information from the file of sessions that I just added in. Um, finding the right session using the widget that I added. Um, and determining, you know, orchestrating agents at scale at 11:15 with James and Rohan is like the best session for me to go to to learn more about this. Um, and then I see a couple rivets because this is this is actually Fro talking to me and and ribbiting at me.

### 📋 セクション 146

So, okay, I think this agent looks good. need need to watch the time. Um, so we just built a few specialized agents using tools. We added in guardrails. We customized them using some widgets and then we also tested out the workflow in preview.

### ⭐ セクション 147

The one thing we haven't yet done is a full set of evals. And we can also do that directly from the agent builder um to make sure that everything behaves exactly as expected before going live. Um, but right now I've got a giant clock chasing me and dev day is waiting. So let's publish this. Um, hit publish here.

### 📝 セクション 148

Let's call this ask froge. Hit publish. Um, and I now have a fully deployed published agent in production with a workflow [Applause] in my own servers. But you can see this is this is quite a bit of code to write. And so I'm just going to stick with using the workflow ID that we just created and then head over to my site.

### 💡 セクション 149

So here in my dubday site, I'm first going to create a chatkit session using um the the workflow that we just created. I'll simply drop in that workflow um ID. I'll add in the chatkit react component using that client secret that we just created in our own server. and then adding in visual customization as well to again make this really froze themed. In this case, it's going to be called ask froge.

### 🔧 セクション 150

It's going to continue to rivet in the placeholder. Um, and it'll have some froge specific colors and starter props. I'll add this froze chat um in a bottom sheet so it'll come up from the bottom of the page. And then finally, I'll add in a link to ask froge at the top of the site um so that it's really front and center on our website. So, let's go back to our site.

### 🎯 セクション 151

There it is. Ask froge top of the site. Let's try it out. So, what session to attend to learn about building agents? And again, this is running through that exact same workflow we just created, checking for guard rails, categorizing the message, pulling from tools from file search, using the widget that we designed, and then again deciding orchestrating agents at scale is the right um session for me to go to and and continuing to rivet in this style of approach.

### 💭 セクション 152

So, okay, great. We've done it. The agent is ready. We can stop the clock. The agent is ready with uh 49 seconds to spare.

### 📌 セクション 153

Um and I can keep iterating on this agent directly in the um in the visual builder and also deploy these changes directly to my site without making any code changes at all. This includes adding new tools, um, adding new widgets for other use cases, adding new guardrails, and I can even wire it up to client side tools to take actions directly in my website. Um, so in just a few minutes, we've designed an agent workflow visually. We added in some tools and widgets. We previewed it, we deployed it, we tested it, and now you all can use it.

### ✅ セクション 154

This is actually live now in your Devday site. um you can tap your badge and you should be able to to see it and use it and um find the sessions that are best for you. So, we're looking forward to using it and meeting Fro and also seeing all of the new experiences that you'll now be able to build using Agent Kit. Thanks. And back to Sam.

### 📚 セクション 155

Thank you, Christina. I think that's so cool. I can't wait to see what you'll all build with it. So, we've looked at AI apps, agents, uh, but now let's shift to one more thing that's just as important, how we write software. One of the most exciting things happening with AI is that we're entering a new era with that changes how software gets written.

### 🔖 セクション 156

Anyone with an idea can build apps for themselves, their families, or their communities. And before we talk about codeex, we want to show you a few examples. In Japan, an 89year-old retiree taught himself to code with the help of Chachi BT. He's now built 11 iPhone apps for elderly users. He's turning a lifetime of wisdom into tools that help others live more independently.

### 🎨 セクション 157

In Spain, Pal Garcia and members of domestic data streamers are helping people reconnect with memories using chatbt, image generation, and Sora. At ASU, med students needed a better way to practice the kinds of difficult human conversations they'll have as doctors. So, they built a virtual patient app with our models where they can try, fail, and get better before they step into a real exam room. And at Versailles in France, visitors can now walk the palace and talk to it. They built an experience where you have a live discussion with art and sculptures with our real-time API.

### 🚀 セクション 158

History becomes a conversation. It's awesome to see what people are building and this is why we're so excited to give developers even more tools to build faster. So earlier this year, we launched a research preview of Codeex, OpenAI's software engineering agent built to work alongside developers and speed up how software gets created. Since then, Codex has become very loved and grown into a much more capable collaborator. It works everywhere you code now.

### ⚡ セクション 159

your IDE, the terminal, GitHub, and in the cloud. Your chat GPT account connects everything so you can move your work seamlessly between your tools. We've released a ton of new features for codecs, and it now runs on the new GPT5 codeex model, a version of GPT5 purposely trained for codecs and a coding. This model is better at tasks like code refactoring and code review, and it can dynamically adjust its thinking time for the complexity of the task. Developers love this new model and the codec usage has gone up really fast.

### 🌟 セクション 160

One of our key metrics for looking at this is daily messages. The number of tasks and conversations that developers have with codecs each day. Since early August, daily messages are up 10x across codecs. And this rapid usage has also helped GPT5 codeex become one of our fastest growing models ever. Since its release, we have served over 40 trillion tokens from the model.

### 🎬 セクション 161

Internally at this point, Codex is everywhere we build. Almost all new code written at OpenAI today is written by Codex users. Our engineers that use Codeex complete 70% more pull requests each week. And nearly every OpenAI PR goes through a Codeex review. And from that, people get more depth than they'd expect, even from a very senior engineer.

### 📋 セクション 162

Starting today, Codeex is officially out of research preview and into G. And while Thank you, And while Codeex already has a lot of traction with individual developers, today we're introducing a new set of features to make codecs more helpful for engineering teams. First, we have a Slack integration. This has been very much requested so that you can ask codecs to write code or answer questions directly from team conversations in Slack. Second, a new codeex SDK so that you can extend and automate codecs in your team's own workflows.

### ⭐ セクション 163

And third, new admin tools and reporting, including environment controls, monitoring, analytics, dashboards, and more so that enterprises can better manage codecs. Expect to see a lot more codeex improvements coming soon. One of the things that's been really inspiring to us is to see the breadth of people using codecs. From developers building side project on weekends to high growth startups to big global enterprises, Cisco rolled out codeex across its entire engineering or they're now able to get through code reviews 50% faster and have reduced the average project timeline from weeks to days. So for our next demo, we want to show you something fun.

### 📝 セクション 164

We're going to show you how can you can use the new codecs and our APIs to turn anything around you into workable software. And for that, please welcome Raman to the stage. >> Good morning, everyone. Last year, we built an iPhone app from scratch, and we've even programmed a mini drone live on stage using 01, our first reasoning model. It was kind of vibe coding before we even had a name for it, frankly.

### 💡 セクション 165

But the progress since has been incredible. Codex is now a teammate that understands your context. It works alongside you and it can reliably take on work for your team. And we thought about how do we best show you all of the cool things that Codeex can now do. We had a lot of ideas, but one that we kind of kept coming back to is what about building something that we could all experience and see together here in this room right now.

### 🔧 セクション 166

So that's our challenge. If you look up here, some of you might notice a camera that's mounting above the stage. And I thought maybe we could start there. And so earlier I asked Codex CLI to create a very simple control panel interface with a very like simple interface. See a camera feed on the left, some buttons on the right, and if we can bring my laptop on screen, you'll see what uh what Codex came up with.

### 🎯 セクション 167

Initially did it really well, but then I also added the Figma branding from the dev day event so it could pull the exact colors and components to actually render it perfectly matching our design. Great. So that's our place to get started. Now I haven't written a single line of code, but let's dive in and see what we can do on top of that. Now switching over here to uh we're going to skip this version.

### 💭 セクション 168

Skipping over here to my terminal uh which wanted to update uh I'm sure you uh you can see that we have Codex CLI. It's logged in with my chat GPT account and it's powered by GPT5 Codex, our net new model that Sam mentioned. Now, let's start by asking this question that I'm sure many of you have not asked a coding agent before. How to control a Sony FR7 camera in Node. And honestly, I did not know how to get started.

### 📌 セクション 169

I saw there was a C++ SDK and I thought maybe like Codex, we want to use that and turn it into JavaScript. But then it had a much better idea than that. Uh I realized that there's a Visca protocol apparently to control these cameras. So, you know, as you can see, Codex can respond pretty fast for questions like this. And this all seemed promising to me.

### ✅ セクション 170

So basically I went ahead and I typed this script over to Codex to completely scaffold an integration using the Visca protocol and wire it up to that uh control panel. Now Codex is becoming harder and harder to demo by the way because it can really work tirelessly on your task. I've seen it work for up to seven hours on a very big refactoring for instance and get it right which is pretty outstanding. here. If I we switch over and if we scroll back up, you know, it updated its plan along the way, wrote a lot of code and everything.

### 📚 セクション 171

And this was the final result. As you can see on the screen, it worked for over 13 minutes on that one task, but it did everything I wanted it to do. So, let's take a closer look. If I jump over to VS Code now, you can see on the right side of the screen, we also have our codeex integration in the ID. And these are the files that the Codex CLI came up with for the camera control.

### 🔖 セクション 172

So you can see it built a node server. It also figured out all of the UDP packets to send to this camera. Imagine the time it would have taken me to actually learn this protocol that's over 30 years old. By the way, Codex even figured out that there was like some very specific headers to to send for this particular camera. All right.

### 🎨 セクション 173

So with uh this UI components now wired up, the server is running. So we can uh take a quick look and try this. So here if I turn on the camera. There we go. We have the camera.

### 🚀 セクション 174

That's all of you. Awesome. And let's try the controls. Boom. I can actually control the camera now from this interface.

### ⚡ セクション 175

It's pretty cool. All right. But controlling with buttons is nice, but I think we can do something better. So I'm going to try to send uh another task, but live this time inside our ID extension. So check this out.

### 🌟 セクション 176

wire up an Xbox wireless controller to control the camera. So, I'm going to send this one right now. I was uh backstage earlier and I found this Xbox controller. I wasn't sure who's playing back there, but I thought this could be something we could try. Uh so, we're going to leave it here.

### 🎬 セクション 177

And as you can see now, like Codeex made a plan. Apparently, three tasks have to be completed. It's now exploring the file. It's figuring out how to wire up this game pad. And what's interesting here is you can see in the ID we also have this concept of auto context.

### 📋 セクション 178

And what that means is that your prompts can be pretty short because codeex will kind of understand your intent. It will see like the the recent files that you've used and really kind of adjust accordingly. So as you can see we're now at task number two. This one will probably take another minute or so. So we'll leave it run in the background.

### ⭐ セクション 179

So in the meantime, what else could we do? Well, I thought one exciting interface is voice. So, to save us a few minutes, I've already asked Codex to integrate with our real-time API and our agents SDK, and I wanted to wire up all of this into the app right here on this green little dot at the bottom right of the screen. But what's great about the real-time API is that it brings natural speech to speech into your app, but it also connects to any MCP server in the context of that conversation. And so that really got me thinking, what else could we show you in this room and turn into an MCP server?

### 📝 セクション 180

And then I thought, wait, we have a lighting system. So maybe we could wire up the lighting system of the venue over to an MCP server. So let me check out this task that I sent to Codex, but this time in Codex cloud. So you can see here my prompt. I asked Codex to uh, you know, wire up this MCP server for this very specific model of lighting system.

### 💡 セクション 181

I gave it like the the reference docs that I found and I gave it the exact interface that I wanted to have for my UI to work. But what's fascinating to me is like if you look at the logs for instance like that's really the magic of uh the agentic behavior of codeex like I could have asked a teammate to do that but because the task was very specific now codeex is my teammate and if you look at how it went through the process it actually figured at some point that it needed to kind of find new information about command 8 to move forward so then it went ahead to fetch the GitHub docs again to kind of really like operate and call tools along the way and that's really the magic of GPT5 codeex you can really let it go off do some complex tasks and and you'll see this like aentic behavior emerge and then after that I did one more turn to actually ask codeex to like include the read me information so I can understand how to run it and sure enough here is my MCP server now going back to uh VS Code what's also very interesting sounds like the Xbox task just finished we'll see that in a moment awesome uh and now going back here you can see that you have uh all your local but also your cloud tasks right here inside the VS code extension. So if I click on the build MCP server for instance this is the task I just showed you uh on uh CEX cloud and here I can actually apply all of the changes locally if I want to test them. So I can just go ahead and click apply and now all of the changes with this MCP server are now included locally. Now, I didn't want to watch you uh I didn't want to let you watch me do npm install here on stage.

### 🔧 セクション 182

So, I just uh took that MCP server already and I started to install all of the dependencies to make it run. So, let's now put all of that to the test. But first of all, if we go back to our app right here, let's see if we can actually control this camera now with this Xbox controller. There we go. It works.

### 🎯 セクション 183

That's pretty awesome. What's funny is like I didn't even specify to codeex which button should do what, but it figured that the joystick was probably a good idea. So that's that's actually perfect. But let's uh do the real test now. Let's enter voice mode and see uh what happens.

### 💭 セクション 184

So sorry in advance AV team, but we'll try to see if Codex figured this out uh to control the lights. Hi there. Hello. Hi there. I can hear you loud and clear.

### 📌 セクション 185

Let me know what you need. >> Yeah. What do you see on the camera? >> I see a large audience in front of you with rows of attendees seated and ready. The room is well lit and the crowd stretches far back filling the space.

### ✅ セクション 186

>> That's right. Could you uh shine the lights towards the audience? >> There we go. >> I've just lit up the audience with a nice bright wash. They should be perfectly highlighted now.

### 📚 セクション 187

Can you uh greet everyone here in the room now? >> Absolutely. The audience lights are up. Let's welcome this fantastic crowd. Hello amazing developers at Fort Mason.

### 🔖 セクション 188

We are so excited to have you here for an incredible day. Awesome. Could you now do something fun with the lights and say hi to people tuning in on the live stream? We've got the fun lights rolling now. Some dynamic colorful effects in motion.

### 🎨 セクション 189

And to everyone watching the live stream, thanks for joining us. This is going to be an amazing experience. Cool. All right, let's go back to normal now. Awesome.

### 🚀 セクション 190

So, I still have not written a single line of code, by the way, to make this happen. But there's one more thing I wanted to show you. Last but not least, Sam mentioned that we're launching the Codex SDK today. And so I wanted to finish up with something that gives you a little bit of a glimpse into what might be the future of software engineering. So let me go back into voice mode and try this.

### ⚡ セクション 191

Hi, could you ask Codeex to show a credits overlay like at the end of the movie, but this time the cast is all DD attendees? I'm running that with codeex now. I'll let you know when it's ready. >> Great. Um, in the meantime, could you start a countdown and take a photo of all of us?

### 🌟 セクション 192

Oh, and there we go. So to explain you what just happened here, when I sent uh a task to the voice agent, it also added codeex SDK as a tool. And what that means is that now on the fly, I can reprogram this app in real time and instantly adapt it to user needs or any kind of feedback they have. So in this case when I asked to create a credits overlay it was able to go ahead and edit the code inside this React app reloaded find what it needed to complete the task and now the credits are rolling. It's pretty amazing.

### 🎬 セクション 193

So with all that we took voice we took a sketch we took some devices around us and we turned all of this into workable software and all of that without writing a single line of code by hand. So really give Codex your most ambitious ideas. Give Codex your most complex coding problems and see what happens. I think you'll be as amazed as we are every day. The only limit now is your imagination.

### 📋 セクション 194

Thank you so much. Back to you, Sam. >> Thanks, Ramon. Uh, this is the biggest change to how software gets created that I have ever seen, and we can't wait to see what you all will do with it. I think the future is going to be very bright.

### ⭐ セクション 195

We've covered a lot today, but obviously models matter a lot too. So I want to share a few model updates. Back in August, we launched GBT5. We trained it to be really good at steering agents and endto-end coding and GPT5 has delivered on that. Leading coding startups like Cursor, Windsurf, and Verscell are using GPT5 to change how software gets written and shipped in their apps.

### 📝 セクション 196

And then after that, we released GPT5 Pro, the most intelligent model that we've ever shipped. Today we're launching GPT5 Pro in the API. It's available to all developers and we hope you enjoy. [Applause] GPT5 Pro is great for assisting with really hard tasks like finance, legal, healthcare, and much more where you need high accuracy and depth of reasoning. We're also releasing a smaller voice model in the API with GPT Realtime Mini.

### 💡 セクション 197

It is smaller, 70% cheaper version of the advanced voice model we shipped two months ago with the same voice quality and expressiveness. Personally, I think that voice is going to become one of the primary ways that people interact with AI. And this is a big leap towards that reality. Now, I want to shift gears and talk about what's new for creators. Uh, and this has been a hotly requested one, so we hope you'll like it.

### 🔧 セクション 198

Uh, we've been seeing incredible work from filmmakers, designers, game developers, educators, and more using AI as part of their creative process. Today, we're releasing a preview of Sora 2 in the API. [Applause] You now have access to the same model that powers Sora 2's stunning video outputs right in your own app. One of the biggest jumps that we've made with this model is how controllable it is. You can give it detailed instructions and it holds on to the state while delivering results that feel stylized, accurate, and composed.

### 🎯 セクション 199

For example, you can take the iPhone view and prompt Sora to expand it into a sweeping cinematic wideshot. But one of the most exciting things that we've been working on is how well this new model can pair sound with visuals. Not just speech, but rich soundscapes, ambient audio, synchronized effects that are grounded in what you're seeing. So, here's an example in this kayak video. You can also bring pieces of the real world into Sora, too.

### 💭 セクション 200

For example, you could take a picture of your dog and give your dog some new friends. >> Look who's coming, buddy. Here they all are. Good pups. Come on.

### 📌 セクション 201

That's it. Everybody together. Happy dogs. So, Sor Sor 2 is also great for concept development. You can just describe a general vibe or a product and Sora will give you a visual starting point.

### ✅ セクション 202

So, here we're going to use it to generate concepts for an e-commerce ad. When your new place feels like a blank canvas, find the pieces that make it yours. Browse, customize, and check out in minutes. Delivered fast to your door. >> People seem to love Sora 2.

### 📚 セクション 203

It's been on the top of the app store since we've launched it and the creativity that people are demonstrating has been super fun for us to watch. We hope that now with Sora 2 preview in the API, you will generate the same high-quality videos directly inside your products, complete with the realistic and synchronized sound and find all sorts of great new things to build. Just like our other modalities, it's built for flexibility. You get to control video length, aspect ratio, resolution, easily remix videos. Mattel has been a great partner working with us to test Sora 2 in the API and seeing what they can do to bring product ideas to life more quickly.

### 🔖 セクション 204

So, one of their designers can now start with a sketch and then turn these early concepts into something that you can see and share and react to. So, let's take a look at how this works. that that is a very cool new way to build toys. Uh and it's incredible to watch with AI how fast ideas can turn into sharable, workable designs. So, we're excited to see what else you'll come up with as you use Sor 2 in your own products.

### 🎨 セクション 205

We hope that today gave you a few ideas of new things to build. We want OpenAI to be a great platform for this new era of building. We think things are going to get pretty incredible pretty soon. All of our announcements today are aimed to support you in this work. The apps SDK for building native apps inside of Chat GPT.

### 🚀 セクション 206

Agent kit so you can deploy agents wherever you'd like easily and with more confidence. a more powerful codeex changing the way software gets written helping your team ship faster and new models in the API GPT5 Pro Sora 2 and Realtime Mini that expand what's possible we're watching something significant happen I think software used to take months or years to build you saw that it can take minutes now to build with AI you don't need a huge team you need a good idea and you can just sort of bring it to reality faster than ever before. So, thank you all for being here and thank you for building. Our goal, one second, I'm almost done. Uh, our goal is to make AI useful for everyone.

### ⚡ セクション 207

And that goal won't happen without all of you. So, we're very grateful that you're here to build with us. And also a huge thanks to the team that made today possible. A huge amount of work went into this. And there's a lot more work.

### 🌟 セクション 208

There's a lot more happening throughout the day. So, enjoy the sessions and we'll see you later. Thank you very much. All [Music] right. All right.

### 🎬 セクション 209

So, some exciting things, some interesting things. Uh, some people think that everything's boring. What? Uh, okay. Let's let's talk about what we we thought about this whole thing.

### 📋 セクション 210

So, um, agent builder. So, I asked about 50/50 people. Um, oh, Ferszad isn't here. Hey, Fzad. Um, so 50/50 people said half of you will use it.

### ⭐ セクション 211

It sounds like I mean, if if if you're already doing it with the CLI, you know, if you're good with coding and stuff like that, that's probably underwhelming, right? For people that are not coders, how exciting was the agent builder for you. Uh Colola is saying hoping for sort 2 to come to free pick and other third parties. Having agent kit and chipt is convenient. Agent SDK Hey, can we just for a second uh re appreciate the fact that most of those most of the stuff they showed were live demos.

### 📝 セクション 212

Zero things failed. It seemed like that is uh unbelievable. I couldn't get my camera to get to to to start working this morning. So, this is kind of a kind of a big deal. All right.

### 💡 セクション 213

So, Dan Shipper looks like he's over at uh, you know, at the thing streaming live, doing stuff live. Very, very cool. Rowan Chang also seems like he's over there interviewing Sam Alman after the keynote. Give me one. All right.

### 🔧 セクション 214

So cherrypick demos. Um, and then so the gentleman towards the end with the French accent who was doing the camera uh uh stuff. So, a lot of people seem to get excited about that. Um, I guess let me ask you this. So, what's the most exciting thing?

### 🎯 セクション 215

The colored lights failed. Okay. The codeex demo is amazing. Sora went from 10 cents to five to to 50 cents per second. Agent Builder Xbox ad codeex.

### 💭 セクション 216

Okay. Very interesting. Does anybody have links? Uh is there a place that has all the links of the stuff that they've announced? Opening eyes at three quadrillion token annual run rate.

### 📌 セクション 217

All of humanity speaks at 50 quadrillion tokens a year. We're scheduled to interview Mr. Immad Mustak uh uh this week. So uh that should be pretty exciting. 5 Pro and the API is a big deal.

### ✅ セクション 218

Very cool. What do you reckon of a dedicated gaming console that is just AI generated games that generate on the fly? I I mean that's going to be amazing from a technological perspective. Um that's not the thing that fires me up the most about how like AI and gaming intersects. To me, it's about creating like live worlds where you have living characters with backstories and uh that are, you know, seemingly conscious like they have some sort of a awareness of what's happening in terms of in the game world.

### 📚 セクション 219

They have us like a story. To me, that blows my mind. Um like the the diffusion models, AI generated games, like those are cool. Like I really enjoyed seeing those. Like the Doom thing was amazing.

### 🔖 セクション 220

Um all the other stuff was amazing. I forget the name of the recent ones where you could like walk around in GTA. I mean, they're getting impressive, I gotta say. Uh, okay. Opening as new site has several blogs for each release.

### 🎨 セクション 221

Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Gotcha.

### 🚀 セクション 222

Thank you for that. Yeah, cuz they they don't have like one thing. Um live stream Yeah. Does anybody have the link for uh the agent builder? like I'm trying to find that.

### ⚡ セクション 223

So in we do have the agent mode in Chad GBT already. So that went live. So So this is kind of like the agent mode. It's on the news page. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 224

Okay. Okay. Okay. There we go. I think they just Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 225

Yep. They just uh updated it, it seems like. Okay, cool. So, this is the thing that I'm seeing in uh Chad GPT. So, we have some sort of an agent uh mode, so to speak.

### 📋 セクション 226

And Here it's working for 12 minutes. It went through a bunch of sources. So it actually used their operator. Went through pulled a bunch of stuff, metrics, etc., etc., etc., and wrote up a report. So I'm going to dig into that later.

### ⭐ セクション 227

Um, so this is not this is not new, the agent mode, right? Because this is the first time that that I've seen it today because looks like it's got like a certain limited amount of things in there. Did I completely miss this? This seemed like the um Yeah, I tried the comment browser. That was that was pretty cool, I gotta say.

### 📝 セクション 228

Okay, here's the stuff that's um been announced. So, apps in Chad GBT and build them. Okay. Agent kit codeex. Okay.

### 💡 セクション 229

Very cool. I was very excited to see that. Um, like I know a number of these companies, like most of them actually, but Whoop was on there. I use the Whoop tracking thing, which is pretty cool. Um, kind of been enjoying that.

### 🔧 セクション 230

Let me bring chat back up. Okay. while I figure out how to. So, has anybody used the agent kit already because they said today is it live? Okay.

### 🎯 セクション 231

Platform.openai.combuilder. Right. That's the link. Okay. Yeah, sorry.

### 💭 セクション 232

So, Keith, thank you for posting. It sounds like it's removing the um the link the URLs, but I appreciate people people posting it. Using it now. Okay. Very very cool.

### 📌 セクション 233

Agent kit is available in the API. Agent is convenient, but it's slow. So, I think Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 234

I'm I'm in it right now. I found it. So, um I think for people that are not developers and most a lot of people are like are are not developers or or even if they know how to code and stuff like that, they're going to sit there putting this stuff together necessarily. This is really opening up a lot of doors, I feel like. So, I'm I'm pretty excited about this.

### 📚 セクション 235

I mean, this seems like a big deal. Um, so here's kind of what that's looking like. So this is Oh boy. All right. So, this is it.

### 🔖 セクション 236

So, we're going to create start my agent. Uh, interesting. Okay. So, oh, quick question for you. So, I was thinking about doing some sort of starting to do um sort of using various AI tools like this one and just doing live streams showing me showing you guys how I use them kind of starting from scratch, right?

### 🎨 セクション 237

So, just diving in without any experience and then like going through it. Let me know if that's going to be something that's um that's going to be useful for people because there's tons of these interesting AI tools. I don't have I always want to catch up on them. I feel like doing a live stream might might be um might be useful. Okay, Cole interested.

### 🚀 セクション 238

Okay, awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I'm going to I'm going to start doing that um just cuz I feel it'll also motivate me to learn more of these tools because there's like tons of this stuff that I want to learn. All right.

### ⚡ セクション 239

So my agent call the model. We have GPT5 4.1 Nano and the pro including today's um 1006 version. So that checkpoint as well as the older reasoning models and 40 is in there. So the agent builder I feel like they said it's openi models only, right? Um, so that's why some of these startups and stuff like that, maybe they're they won't be as impacted because they're still going to be able to build what, you know, bring their own models and and use whatever models you want.

### 🌟 セクション 240

OpenI really seems like they're trying to quarter their market, so to speak. Or maybe it's it's hard to make all models work with stuff like this. They need specific training or whatever to um to work. Interesting. So for reasoning models, display a summary of the model's internal reasoning process.

### 🎬 セクション 241

This gives the insight into cognitive steps that shape the response. You have to verify your organization. So they're really protecting. Um all right, Adrian, uh thank you so much for being here. Catch you next time.

### 📋 セクション 242

Um but it sounds like you have to verify your organizations for you to get the output. So that's interesting. So they're protecting um people protecting their models from getting you knowledge distillation for for other labs potentially just pulling that stuff out. Show research sources display responses in chat. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 243

So that's interesting. And then we have various MCP Whoops. Okay. Invoke a model text protocol. All right.

### 📝 セクション 244

So, we got MCP servers, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar. This is I don't know even if you're not a developer or even if you are a developer I mean just the simplicity of doing something like this because look you have Stripe and Shopify HubSpot PayPal Cloudflare right you also have all your Gmails um stuff like just with this handful of things there could be some interesting stuff you can build we also have. So this is kind of the same thing for OpenAI other developers and of course you can add pretty much whatever else that you want. Okay, so this is interesting. We have our various if else logic stuff conditions to branch the workflow while loops user approved.

### 💡 セクション 245

Pause for a human to approve or reject a step guard rails run moderation jailbreak or hallucination checks. Oh, that's interesting. So if like you get hijacked at some point, you can run a a check like did this have something injected? Is there a jailbreak? Is it hallucinating?

### 🔧 セクション 246

Transform set date. Okay. and whatever files you want. This is uh this could be interesting. It's not available in the EU.

### 🎯 セクション 247

Yeah. I I mean I I don't know because it feels like EU has some laws obviously that that the US doesn't have in terms of all this stuff that delays it. Um, but obviously, you know, I mean, I mean, the the the labs could put more effort into getting some traction in there, but I feel like I feel like the regulations are making it difficult. Um, available in Iraq. Okay, that's Yeah, it's really the EU that's really like uh uh breaking a lot of these things.

### 💭 セクション 248

Um I have access right now in Germany. How do the um what are they called? The Wow, blanking out at the the cloaked servers. What are they called? Wow.

### 📌 セクション 249

Um I am completely blanking on my words today. The VPNs, do VPNs in general work fairly reliably to get around stuff? Like if you're on a NordVPN or something like that, does that get you does that get you through opposite of any work platform we tried in the past other work regulations. So states that have laws that waste these federal funds should not receive those funds. But this all right.

### ✅ セクション 250

So she she this is the same person. Looks like they do the kind of like the same walkthrough. This is for a flight of some sort. What are some use cases that everyone is Oh, I'm sorry. Did it like get super loud?

### 📚 セクション 251

I apologize. Um, what is what are the use cases that people are going to be using this for? I wonder. Anybody have any ideas? Email review, reply, and reminder.

### 🔖 セクション 252

Yeah. Yeah, definitely for email management. That would be, I got to say, pretty pretty cool. Integration of Teams and Calendar is cool. Yeah, I mean I feel like there's a million different little use cases that would be that would be very very cool to to try out with this thing.

### 🎨 セクション 253

All right. All right. So, let me see if there's anything else interesting going on with the streaming or anything like that because there's tons of people there there live that might be doing something, but I think they're just recording. They're not necessarily going to be doing live streaming from the event. The Mattel thing was interesting where you're able to create this idea for a toy and then Sora just like animates that toy kind of like putting it into real life.

### 🚀 セクション 254

I mean that that's going to be interesting. All right. Well, um I'm going to be doing some testing with the agent builder later and maybe creating some um maybe creating some uh workflows, but I feel like that's going to take a while. That's not something like I got to hook up all the um MCP stuff and all that. all that stuff.

### ⚡ セクション 255

Um, but overall, so opening a podcast live from dev day starting in 30 seconds. Let's see what they're talking about here. This might be a This might be a long one. I'm not sure if I'm going to be sticking around that long because I kind of want to get my hands on uh the stuff that's happening. So, let's see what they're talking about.

### 🌟 セクション 256

uh it's been important for us to be able to manage students using this in a cost-effective way. So those have been the two areas that AI progression has helped from our work. It has been a lot of uh orchestration which I'm sure we'll talk about a little bit just just getting different AI agents and models to work together uh for the best outputs for students in particular. So a couple of the releases we saw today, one was the agents SDK now and you've talked about that. >> How much have one tools changed the ability of one to work faster into the scope of what you find is capable now?

### 🎬 セクション 257

>> Yeah, I think we're seeing teams across industries work way faster and building better software because they've got kind of this always on expert hyper senior uh engineer next to them that they're pair programming with, right? And uh so we all right. So let me put the chat back up here. Yeah. So all in all, I mean, there's nothing sort of mind-blowing right off the top, but basically when we start testing these things out, it'll be kind of interesting to see what's kind of possible with this stuff.

### 📋 セクション 258

I mean, certainly looks interesting, but we got to test it. I want to mess around with the agent builder a little bit. Um, and excuse me. Definitely tons of stuff for developers that are going to be using, you know, you know, Sora in the API in the API, GPT5 Pro in the API. That's going to be useful for people if that's, you know, use cases that you're using.

### ⭐ セクション 259

Um, they already have use cases on the website. That's interesting. View docs. Okay. Starter.

### 📝 セクション 260

Okay. They have example apps. Yeah, I got to check this stuff out. It might be a little bit boring to watch because there's going to be a lot of reading and just messing around with stuff. So, um, but for everybody that's uh that join me for the live stream, I really appreciate it.

### 💡 セクション 261

So, I'll try to have like a little follow-up at some point video. And I once I'm caught up on the documentation, we're probably going to sit down and build something. I'll probably shoot another I'll set up another live stream so that we can kind of um start learning this stuff together during the live stream and kind of go step by step. So, next gaming stream when I don't know uh I got a little bit uh interested in Mega Bonk. That's the latest viral hit.

### 🔧 セクション 262

Something about these one developer games like what it's just one developer that kind of brings something something about that is very special. H. So maybe maybe uh maybe soon. We'll see. Anyways, thank you so much everybody for being here and uh I'll let you know when the next live stream is up.

### 🎯 セクション 263

Good luck and uh yeah, exciting times ahead. Thank you. See you in the next one.
