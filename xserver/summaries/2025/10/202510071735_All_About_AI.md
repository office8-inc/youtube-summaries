## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Morning everyone. Thanks for being here at Dev Day. Whoa. All right. We are trying to make AI beneficial to everyone.

### 📋 背景・概要

And apparently I am still learning how to walk on the stage. Chat GPT can now connect to your bank account and spend your money on so on. Open AI had their dev day yesterday and there was some interesting stuff. I wouldn't say everything was interesting for me personally. Uh but I want to start off with something I do want to try out and that is the Sora 2 API.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh, I think this could be pretty cool. And there are some cool stuff we can build with this. So, this is what I focus on today. And we're just going to go through some of the notes I have here. Uh, we have two different versions of the model.

### 📝 詳細説明

We have the Sora 2 that is kind of available in the app, I think. Uh, this is fast generation, good quality, and we have the Sora 2 Pro. We're going to try that out. So, this is slower uh but higher quality and a bit of a higher resolution. Uh we can do image inputs.

### 💡 実例・デモ

We can try that out. Uh remix is something we want to test. Uh yeah, there are some restrictions. So we can't do so many interesting things. Uh but there are few things we can try out uh with input images.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Uh yeah, and prompting. I guess that's pretty straightforward. Uh so I think we're just going to get into it here and kind of look at uh let's start with the pricing. That is pretty interesting. So if you look at the pricing uh there are two different or kind of three different pricing models here.

### 🎯 応用例

You can see we have the Sor 2 uh that has a portrait and a landscape of 720p, right? Uh but if you look at Sor 2 Pro, we can also do 720p. Um this costs 30 cents per 10 seconds per second. So if you want to make a 10 second video, that's $3. Oh, that is not cheap.

### 💭 考察

Uh, and if you go up to the Yeah, the 1024 resolution, uh, it's $5 for 10 seconds. So, yeah, you got to choose choose your uh, generations with care here, I think. Uh, but this is fine. This is more of like a standard. It's on the high end, but you can make a 10-centent uh 10-second video for for $1.

### 📌 まとめ

Uh that is okay. I would say it's not crazy. Uh so let's see what we can do now with the API here. So as always, I think OpenAI do a good job with their um their code here. It's very easy to use, right?

### ✅ 結論

We just pick a model. Uh we can have a prompt. So now we're going to use the default parameters. And this is a very simple snippet. Uh we can add some parameters here like um yeah, we can add seconds.

### 📚 追加情報

I think we can choose between 4, 8, and 12. Uh we can do the parame uh the model right and we can do the the aspect ratio right uh portrait or vertical. Uh this video ID is also something we're going to use. I'm going to show you that later. But pretty much it's a straightforward standard API call uh uh with kind of the API here.

### 🔖 補足

It's nothing fancy. You have you you'll be kind of used to this. Uh we can do Python too. It's pretty much the same setup. So let's give it a spin.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, let's head over to cursor. So, this is kind of my setup now. I'm going to pick the Sora 2 model. I'm going to do portrait. Is that Yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Uh 12 seconds. Uh I'm just going to call it output uhmpp4. Uh that's pretty straightforward. We're not going to do any input image now. We're just going to do like a standard video generation.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, down here now, we can just put in like node generate video.js and add our prompt here. Uh we're going to do some of the viral videos I have generated. I'm not going to go into that now, but I had some crazy viral videos with this. So, this is like a body cam with a gamer getting uh arrested for being too bad at a video game. So, let's just run this prompt here.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, when we fire this up now, you can see uh it's pretty standard. We get a video ID here that we can use for remix and stuff. That's pretty interesting. And yeah, this is just going to generate the video here. So, we're just going to cue this and this will come in uh our uh CVD here as output.mpp4.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, it's pretty fast. So, uh let's just wait for this before we do anything else. That was done. So, you can see now we're going to get the video here. Uh output.mpp4.

### 📋 セクション 18

And I thought we can just watch this, right? Uh it's just a meme video, but let's watch it anyway. All right, man. You know why we're here. You died so many times.

### ⭐ セクション 19

The server clock rolled over from database threw an integer overflow and half the leaderboard went down. >> I was just practicing the tree sentinel >> practicing. You ran straight at him with no pants on 11,000 times. You never rolled once. You can't.

### 📝 セクション 20

>> Okay, so it is pretty funny, right? And the I got to say this looks very good. One thing I'm noticing on the API is that there's no video mark or watermark. H I didn't see that before. Okay.

### 💡 セクション 21

Uh that's interesting at least. Uh okay. So that was kind of the the Sora original model that we had tried in the app, right? [snorts] So let's try to do the pro one. So let's try to do the max resolution.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So let's do a landscape this time. Let's grab this resolution here. Go to our code and put in this. Let's do Sora 2 Pro. Uh let's call it output uh yeah whatever, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

And let's call it output pro. Uh let's do the same prompt and let's run it again with this settings. Okay, so that took a while. That took yeah I don't know maybe like 5 minutes at least. Uh but we got the the video here.

### 💭 セクション 24

So it's 12 seconds. Uh I can already tell that the quality is much higher. Uh but let's just watch it a couple of times and just to see how good it looks and how good it sounds. And yeah, remember this is a $5 or more. That's like a $6 video, right?

### 📌 セクション 25

Uh but let's play this now in full. >> Easy, man. You're not in trouble for anything else. Just the deaths. >> I I don't understand.

### ✅ セクション 26

I was just playing. >> Yeah, you died 14 million times. That counter in the corner. >> Server started spitting negatives. Crashed the whole database.

### 📚 セクション 27

Fromoft called us. >> Easy, man. You're not in trouble for anything else. Just the deaths. >> I I don't understand.

### 🔖 セクション 28

I was just playing. >> Yeah. You died 14 million times. That counter in the corner. Server started spitting negatives.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Crashed the whole database. Fromoft called us. >> Okay. again. That was pretty funny.

### 🚀 セクション 30

The how many million times and it crashed the server. So yeah, I think these memes are very good and they're very popular when I put them up online. Uh but again, you can see the quality was much better now and I would say yeah, I I noticed like I can kind of see the details. You can see the still the text is a bit strange. Uh but overall the quality was much better.

### ⚡ セクション 31

I think the sound was a bit better too. I'm not quite sure. It's a bit early to tell. Uh but this looks very good. But it is pricey.

### 🌟 セクション 32

$5 for one video. Can't do a lot of those, at least on my budget. I don't think I'm going to spend too much on this, but um yeah, pretty impressive. Now, let's look at something I thought was pretty cool, and that was the image input. I had a lot of fun with this uh when testing it out.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, I'm going to show you kind of what I was thinking when I put up uh this workflow here. So, if you go to cursor and let's find I think I call it jump too. So I created kind of this storyboard here. So you can see we have this house and we have this guy on top of the rope and I have this jumping. I have the sun here, right?

### 📋 セクション 34

And this a trampoline here. So he's going to jump down here, right? That is the kind of storyboard ID. So what we can do now, uh we can actually just open up the terminal here. And you can see kind of in my prompt here, uh I can do node generate video.js.

### ⭐ セクション 35

This is my script. POV handheld footage. Follow the scenes in the storyboard. And then I'm going to just tag my image here. That's going to be the input, right?

### 📝 セクション 36

So follow the story. Uh this is kind of the guy jumping on the trampoline and there's a sunny day. This is kind of the story and that is the only input I'm going to give it. So let's run this and let's see what kind of yeah video this input generate with the attached image here. Okay.

### 💡 セクション 37

So you can see we got this back, right? And what is interesting that the first frame here is now our input image. Uh I think we've seen this before in other video models. Uh but it does need the first frame to be the image we put in, right? Uh but as you will see soon, uh this will change when we go to the second frame.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So let's uh play this a couple of times and see what we generated from this input prompt. >> All right. Three, two, one. Yes, that was awesome. That launch feels crazy.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Totally worth it. Thumbs up for rooftop trampolines. All right, 3 2 1. Yes. That was awesome.

### 💭 セクション 40

That launch feels crazy. Totally worth it. Thumbs up for rooftop trampolines. >> Okay, I would say that did a pretty good job, right? It kind of did follow.

### 📌 セクション 41

You can see we have the roof here. We have the trampoline. We have the guy jumping down. So, it did actually follow uh our instructions in the storyboard and it kind of did adhere to the handheld camera style we gave it. Right.

### ✅ セクション 42

So, yeah, I think that was pretty cool. And this is just one of the things you can do with input images. It's very restricted at the moment, so I don't think I'm going to play too much with it uh yeah uh today. Uh but the the video would generated at the start of the video the intro joke that was also done with like an input image from the dev day scene right so I guess you kind of understood that so yeah that is kind of the input image now let's look at take a look at the remix feature for this let's go back to Sora 2 let's just do a 720p uh vertical video vertical yeah vertical video uh 12 seconds and the prompt is going to be beautiful Blonde girl in a 30s wearing a coat. Street interview.

### 📚 セクション 43

The male asks her, "What do you what do you say is the biggest joy in life?" Girl answers, "Sitting down at night, just me and a glass of wine and chat GPT handheld camera." So, let's run this prompt and let's watch the video. Then, we're going to try to remix the video just to see what we can do with a video we already have. And this is where we're going to use the video ID. I'm going to show you that. But first, let's create this video.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Okay, so that was done. So you can see here is the result, right? Um, yeah, let's just play it one time and then we're going to try to remix this. What would you say your biggest joy in life is? >> Honestly, sitting down at night, just me, a glass of wine, and chat GPT.

### 🎨 セクション 45

That little ritual makes everything feel okay. >> I love that. >> Okay, that was pretty lame, right? That sounds like a perfect night. Uh, but anyway, let's try to remix this now.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So, what we can do is we can bring up this. Oh, that was a lot of stuff. Let's clear this. So, I'm going to show you kind of the the prompt we can do if we want to remix this. So, this is with my script, of course.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Now, you can see we're going to run node remix video.js. This is kind of my own script. And here is where we put in this video ID. So for every video you generate, you can go to OpenAI and you can fetch these video ids because they get stored in this kind of library where you can go back and download all your generations. And here you can find this ID here.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So I put in the ID and I put in kind of what I want to change. So I want to say change the woman's hairstyle to a 80s ponytail with a pink scrunchie. And I want to change her accent to British. So let's try to do those two things and then we can see what happens with this input video uh when we do the yeah remixing here. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So you can see we ended up with this one and already you can see she already has this high hair ponytail style. So let's just watch the video and hear if her accent also changed. >> What would you say your biggest joy in life is? Honestly, sitting down at night, just me, a glass of wine, and chat GPT. That little ritual makes everything feel okay.

### 📋 セクション 50

>> I love that. >> Yeah. Perfect. Right. So, that is something I also found pretty cool.

### ⭐ セクション 51

You can do different versions of video. Let's say you have a video you really like, but there's a few details missing. This remix feature could be something cool. You can change the color of her coat, maybe the background, the Yeah, I don't know exactly, but uh you you get the point, right? And this was really impressive to be honest.

### 📝 セクション 52

This is something I haven't really tried on other models before. And this is something surely we can build something cool with. Uh but that's going to be an upcoming video. Today, I just want to go through kind of the API here. And if you look at my list now, I don't think there are any other things I want to cover.

### 💡 セクション 53

Of course, the prompting is something you can explore with. I did try to put in like real people, human faces and stuff in with the image input. You just get shut down immediately. It's not like the first day of Sora too. Uh but so far uh I have really enjoyed the API.

### 🔧 セクション 54

I think it's pretty interesting and yeah, I'm looking to create an app maybe in a few a video upcoming video where we can create a very cool AI app using Sor 2. Uh but it gets very expensive fast, right? Let's say I wanted to generate 20 videos on the cheapest model, right? That's going to be $20 for just some fun. >> [sighs] >> It does get expensive fast.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So, I'm not quite sure yet what we're going to use it for, but uh there are some use cases and hopefully the price gets down over time here. So, yeah, I think that was basically everything I wanted to cover in the Sora 2 API. Uh we're going to explore it more later. Um, later this week I think I'm going to do the GPT realtime mini because this get like a 70% less expensive uh a voice real time and we can try to maybe connect some MCPS and stuff to the real time. Maybe we'll test out the 5 Pro in the API.

### 💭 セクション 56

That is also really interesting, but that's going to be in an upcoming video. So yeah, that was Sora 2. Um, I would say go play around with it. It's pretty fun, but uh again expensive. So yeah, hope you learned something from this.

### 📌 セクション 57

Hope you enjoyed it.
