## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, OpenAI just launched ChadBt Atlas. This is OpenAI's own browser. So, here Atlas integrates Chad GBT directly into the browsing experience. This is similar to Perplexity's Comet. So, if you've tried that, this is not going to be too new.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, today, let me show you what they've announced. I've tested this thing kind of extensively. Specifically, I'm very excited about the agent mode. I think we're at a point where these things are becoming legitimately useful. So to start we can type in a question or a URL.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

We can say what's on Reddit today and it gives you kind of a summary of what's happening. You can also go to sources or you can actually navigate you to specific pages. And once you're on a particular web page, you can also click this askt button and just chat with chatbt about what's happening on this page. So let's say click summarize. It will go ahead and summarize the key themes and points from this.

### 📝 詳細説明

So it will search for you. It will summarize pages and with agent mode, it will actually take some pretty advanced actions that interact with the websites. Now, I noticed that it knows my custom instructions that I have for my ChadBt. So, this is your version of ChadBt. This is the same chatbot that that you're used to, but now in this sort of split screen view where you have the browsing and the AI assistant on the right.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And over time, as it gets more memories, better memories, it should get better and better at finding the things you like, navigating the web in the way that you prefer, kind of like which things you're logged into, which things you use. Now, this is a kind of a Chrome plugin. It's live globally, but only on Mac OS. If you're not on Mac OS, you know, it's coming soon, but if you're on a Mac OS, it's available to everyone. The thing that really caught my eye was the agent mode.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, you can click agent mode, and you can select it from here as well. and agent mode. You kind of see preview here. They got a little like this grid-like animation and the cursor moving. And I gotta say, it's getting pretty good.

### 🎯 応用例

So, in this video, I really wanted to dive into agent mode because once the abilities of these large language models pass a certain threshold in terms of how they're able to navigate the web and use Excel spreadsheets and various other computer apps and software, at some point that really begins changing how we interact with our computers, potentially even making people more efficient at their jobs. maybe even automating some jobs. So, I'm not saying we're there yet, but I got to say this is getting pretty good. Let's uh dive in and take a look. All right, let's try out Atlas's agent mode.

### 💭 考察

So, I asked Atlas to interact with Google spreadsheets. I had to go online, find some data, and now asked it to put it into this spreadsheet that I have open. This is what popped up. It said agent mode may introduce risk. And you have two options here.

### 📌 まとめ

You can be logged in to the site that you're interacting with or start logged out. So, this is just to protect you in case there's some sort of an injection. So, we're going to go ahead and click start logged in. And as you can see here, so it's thinking about what it's supposed to do. And it's thinking about it now.

### ✅ 結論

It just went ahead and pasted it all into A6. So, let's see uh where it goes from here. By the way, I may have accidentally made this task a little bit more difficult for it because I think I just accidentally put some random keystrokes into I6 or whatever. So, now it's trying to reverse that. It's like, oh, we don't want that data in there.

### 📚 追加情報

Let me delete it. So, good start, I guess. Oh, there it goes. And it's just um going through line by line. So, basically, what it has to do is go take a look at my channel on YouTube, see what the last 10 videos were, and just get some data like dates, titles, and how many views it has, and then put all that data into this spreadsheet.

### 🔖 補足

So, let's try again. There we go. Date published, title, views. So, notice the little cursor it's using. So, it's actually interacting this, as far as I can tell, live like you and I would.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, it's moving the cursor. It's typing things in. Okay. And now it's putting in the actual data. So, that took a little bit.

### 🚀 セクション 14

That took a minute or two for it to figure out how to do it. So, it did a few different approaches and finally decided to just click on each cell separately and then input the data into that cell. And as it's doing that, interestingly, it's very humanlike how it's approaching this. All right. So, it worked for 6 minutes.

### ⚡ セクション 15

It had a few back and forths, but finally I feel like it did what it was supposed to. Now, there's some issues. So, it didn't take my last 10 videos. I think it just searched my name and then pulled up whatever the first however many videos were shown. And it did struggle with data input for a little bit.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Looks like there's also one piece of information missing views for this particular video. But overall, interestingly, it sort of completed the task. Not perfectly, but I'm not going to say I'm impressed, but my curiosity is peaked. All right, so here we are in Google Docs this time. So, I opened up a brand new Google Docs and I'm going to click on ask ChatGpt here in the corner so that that chat with GPT window pops up that allows you to control everything.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And as you can see here, it gives you some ideas and it also suggests agent mode. So, let's see what that's going to be able to do. We'll click agent mode. Notice we're saying agent mode. We're logged in.

### 📋 セクション 18

And so we're logged into Google Sheets or Google Docs. And we also have some other options. We're using web search. We can use a cloud browser if we wanted to. We can also have GitHub connected as well as Box, Dropbox, Gmail, and there's a lot more.

### ⭐ セクション 19

All right, let's see. We're going to ask it to go to Reddit Singularity, find the top trending AI news, let's say in the last few days, and post them in this document with a brief summary and links to that Reddit post. also includes some data on how many views or upvotes each received. And away it goes. So, it goes into its little agent mode.

### 📝 セクション 20

Very exciting. I apologize if the window looks a little bit weird. So, Atlas went globally live, but only for MacOSS. Will Smith eating spaghetti on the front page of Reddit, but anyway. So, I record on a Windows, but I do have my MacBook.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, I am sort of streaming my MacBook and recording it on my Windows. So, I apologize if it looks a little bit weird. And one other thing I'm going to test simultaneously is well, can it do multiple tasks simultaneously? So, I opened up another tab. I clicked agent mode.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And you know what? I I'll just go ahead and give it a few different tasks that we'll kind of unpack one at a time as it goes along. In a different window, I gave it one of the tasks that I usually give every single thing of this nature, and that is find an online mind sweeper game and win, which sometimes has some pretty hilarious outcomes. And I gotta say I'm very impressed with what it's doing because again this is not the first iterations of OpenAI's sort of computer use. They had operator and now this is agent mode within the Atlas browser.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So it's it's not probably brand new. It's probably built on top of the existing technology. But I think it will be interesting to see how having their own browser how having Chad kind of built in there how that's going to affect its ability to navigate the web to reason about what it's doing. Meanwhile, low and behold, our Reddit task is done. That took about five minutes.

### 💭 セクション 24

It did came up with a title for the sheet. Top AI news from our singularity October 2025. Perfect. Keep in mind this is running or was running simultaneously to this where the agent is playing Mind Sweeper. So, you can have as many tabs as you want open.

### 📌 セクション 25

You can have multiple agents running in there. There's probably some limit. We'll see if we can uh find that limit where the end is, but Ch is doing pretty well with this Mind Sweeper game. But notice it did exactly what we said here. So Will Smith eating spaghetti.

### ✅ セクション 26

So that's talking about Google VO3.1 that was recently launched. It has a summary and interestingly gives some good background. So this playful meme has been around since 2023 and gives a pretty good sort of background. So if you're not familiar why Will Smith is eating spaghetti kind of like in one or two sentences just tells you, you know, back in 2023 this sort of video looked grotesque. And the fact now it looks pretty good kind of sparked a discussion about how quickly AI generated video is progressing.

### 📚 セクション 27

Interestingly, so notice it says why it matters. So actually I just remember this. I do have custom instructions for CHBT. And one of the things that I add into custom instructions for readability is I say why does this matter? So when you're doing deep research, tell me why it matters.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Any insights? Because sometimes it'll just say the headline like this test got a 76% improvement. And if you ask it to tell you any additional insights why it matters, it often gives a much sort of in-depth answer. Oftentimes helping you understand why that's a big headline or you know why it matters. So in this case it very succinctly says look using a familiar meme as a benchmark helps people intuitively grasp the improvements.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Then it has engagement. So we asked for engagement kind of like how many people are enjoying this, upvoting, viewing this and of course the red link. This is perfect. All right. Next, we're going to say let's let's take a look at one of those stories.

### 🚀 セクション 30

That's the new apps SDK that OpenAI launched in ChadBt. So, I'm going to say let's look at the story and just copy and pasted the title of like what it titled it, which is just chipt and apps SDK. And we're going to say let's try to figure out how big of a story this is. And specifically, we're going to compare it to the leaked story that Amazon is planning to lay off something like 600,000 workers in the US and replace them with robots. So, I told it to compare it to that and just pasted in the title of that story.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And we're going to say find whatever metrics online that show how big the stories are relative to each other. We're going to say, use Reddit and up votes as well as Google Trends as well as any other credible sources to determine how much interest there is in these stories. Write out your findings at the bottom of this Google doc. And we're going to click go. So, you're getting what I'm trying to do.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I'm trying to have it do some analysis for me for how big these two sto are compared to each other. Right? So, one has a 10,000 Reddit up votes, the other has 500, right? So, the 10,000 is bigger. Google Trends shows us search data, search trends.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And I'm also extremely curious to see where else it goes to kind of check when left to its own devices. What is it going to use to try to figure out what's a bigger story? What's a trending story? Meanwhile, our mind sweeper agent won the game. Did it do so playing by the rules and being a good sportsman?

### 📋 セクション 34

No. No, it did not. It found some way to cheat. I don't even know what it did. I assume maybe it found some custom board size and just set it to be one by one.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Then it went ahead and just clicked the one square, thereby winning the game. 100% efficiency. Oh boy. Well, I guess I can't blame it. It did win.

### 📝 セクション 36

It did complete the task as I requested it to. All right, let's launch another agent. Let's see if this one can unsubscribe me from all the spammy marketing emails that I receive. I'm going to say go into my Gmail and unsubscribe me from all my emails in the promotions tab that have unsubscribe links. So far, I've had a few agents like this that could do it, but the maximum they're willing to do is like maybe three or four emails and they stop.

### 💡 セクション 37

If this can unsubscribe you from even 10 per run, I mean, I think that would be pretty cool. If it's willing to do all of them, that would be amazing. Okay, I can't show some of these emails, but basically it just says, "Per safety guidelines, I want to make sure you confirm before I proceeded to go and unsubscribe you." And we're going to say, "Yeah, unsubscribe me from everything." So, this is interesting. It encountered a set of instructions on the Gmail page. Now, this could be a prompt injection.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So, it's being very careful. It's like, "Do you want me to not follow any instructions from the screen without your explicit direction?" So, I said, "Yes, unsubscribe me. Don't follow on-screen instructions not related to that task." So, it's going to be interesting to see how well it's able to handle this. All right, the first one is going very well. So, this is from Vimeo.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, it clicked unsubscribe and now hopefully it's going to click the big blue unsubscribe button. And it did. Hooray. Okay. So, one email unsubscribed.

### 💭 セクション 40

That's a uh success. Now, it's unsubscribing me from yet another marketing email. So, that's two. All right. So, it's doing great.

### 📌 セクション 41

Unfortunately, it's stopping to confirm quite a bit, making it a little bit not efficient for me. But I got to say, I mean, it's it's finishing it. It's doing it perfectly correct. Going back to our Reddit research agent. So, we're comparing it to stories, how popular they are, how trending they are.

### ✅ セクション 42

So, it worked for 4 minutes on those stories. And here are the results. So, notice it starts by saying, okay, so on the R Singularity subreddit, the story, one of them gathered this many up votes. that was from the previous instructions from the previous story that it found. And in the same subreddit, the other story earned this many uploads.

### 📚 セクション 43

So I got to give it huge credit for that. So it's drawing on the context. It's comparing apples to apples, right? So it's not going to a bigger subreddit or a smaller subreddit. It's like, okay, we have this data here.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Let's find the correlating data point on that same subreddit for this story number two. It also checks some other subreddit and lists what it finds, how many up votes on two different stories, and also has links in case you want to go and check it out for yourself. Google trends for the past 7 days show that ChadBt apps far outnumber those for Amazon replace worker robots. So, I'm going to give it a solid B for that. You probably need some sort of custom instructions to explain to it how to make sure that you're doing Google Trends correctly.

### 🎨 セクション 45

This is a skill issue, but it's easily fixed. But the fact that I went on Google Trends and visually inspected the graphs and charts, I I mean that's amazing. Very very useful for doing online research. Then we have a media coverage. And there the Amazon piece is one of the most popular ones and it notices that it's that's in contrast to what we found through Google Trends and Reddit.

### 🚀 セクション 46

This is extremely good. This is very impressive. So, in this one, I asked the agent mode of Atlas to go online, find a motivational story about somebody getting into the best shape of their lives. It has to be somewhere where they posted their entire meal plan and food log, right? So, that was sort of step one.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Find what they were eating to get to that point. Then recreate that meal plan for me. Then go on Instacart and order everything that I would need to make that meal plan. So, so far it's added five things. cucumbers.

### 🌟 セクション 48

I think it was searching for whey protein at some point. Looks like it's getting some broccoli and zucchini and garlic for me. So, it's navigating this thing very very effectively. At the very beginning when it just went into Instacart, Instacart pops up saying, "Hey, do you want a free trial of something?" So, I was a little bit worried that Chad is going to be like, "Yeah, that sounds like a great idea." But no, you know what? It said it said no thank you.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Clicked the no thank you button. So, definitely gets a thumbs up for that. And there it is. So that's my order. So as you can see here, there's a bunch of things.

### 📋 セクション 50

Everything looks pretty good. Baby spring mix, natural cage free, large brown eggs. I mean, this this seems legit. All right. So at this point, it worked for 5 minutes.

### ⭐ セクション 51

All the items I got, I believe that this was part of a healthy meal plan. So the 5minute part was just the Instacart and checking out. Before that, it worked for 4 minutes. Finding that transformation. Looks like it found somebody in Men's Health and got their meal plan, a proposed 7-day meal plan.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, that's perfect. Then, it stopped because it needed me to log into Instacart. Again, if you're logged in, it should be able to just keep going. So, the first part was 4 minutes, last part was 5 minutes. So, a total of 9 minutes to go research a meal plan and order it on Instacart.

### 💡 セクション 53

As far as I can tell, this was done flawlessly. All right, here I'm seeing if it's able to use Hey Genen. So, hey Jen is an AI avatar that you're able to use and say whatever you want. Very popular service. So, I told it to go there, find a female avatar and have it talk about Chad GPT Atlas.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So, it worked for a while. It stopped because it needed me to log in. And here it is interacting with the website to try to create that avatar video. It's going to be choosing a voice. Actually, that's interesting.

### 🎯 セクション 55

I'm pretty sure it can't listen to the audio output. So, it it has to just kind of assume it's working. But, it created a script. It pasted it in there. Everything should be working perfectly.

### 💭 セクション 56

So, it wasn't able to completed because the the button is grayed out because you're supposed to select a voice first. So, let's see if it's able to do it. Yeah, it looks like it's doing it fine. Okay. I can hear the sound in the background.

### 📌 セクション 57

So, I can't tell if it's able to if it if it is able to hear the audio output or have some sort of confirmation that the audio played, but it's continuing still for some reason has a trouble selecting the voice. I guess it's clicking on play. It needs to click anywhere else besides play. There it is. Okay, so it selected Annie professional.

### ✅ セクション 58

And now it should be able to click generate video. Wow, it did it. All right, so let's see what it came up with. Let's hit play. Let's see how well the sound comes through.

### 📚 セクション 59

Hello, I'm excited to tell you about ChatGpt Atlas, OpenAI's new AI powered web browser. It integrates the Chat GPT chatbot directly into your browser window. You can ask for instant summaries of articles, compare products, or extract key insights from web pages right in a sidebar without switching tabs. One advanced feature is called agent mode. >> So, that's pretty cool.

### 🔖 セクション 60

It would now give you that whole website, create a script, create an avatar. You know, I just said female avatar, which it did. It selected the right voice. A+. This is terrific.

### 🎨 セクション 61

It had some trouble selecting the voice, but it it figured it out eventually. Next, you might have heard about a Deep Seek OCR paper. Basically, they're finding that we're able to take words, take a picture of those words, so to speak, and basically have a limbs read that. And the data compression is pretty impressive. So instead of trying to shove everything into the context window, we're able to use images to be able to just pack in a lot more data, a lot more words into images.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So I asked Atlas, find out everything about the new Deepseek OCR paper, then find any well-known people in the AI space that have talked about it. Create a Google doc and write out a summary of the paper, what people said about it with links. So there's mainly two things that I was looking here. one, did it sort of figure out what it was about, summarize it in a way that made it easy to understand what it was, and two, Andre Carpathy went into quite some detail about this paper on Twitter. So, I just wanted to see if we would be able to find that cuz when we're saying well-known people in the AI space that talked about it, that better be one of the names.

### ⚡ セクション 63

That's probably one of the most highest sort of ranked AI people that have talked about that paper. And of course, it's supposed to put it a Google doc, which it did. So, it's saying this is an open source vision language model that reimagines how long text context can be compressed and processed by LMS. So, first and foremost, everything is terrific. It's a very good breakdown of why it's important.

### 🌟 セクション 64

They have a significant section. They specifically point out that this is a finding that could enable LMS to handle context of millions of tokens. And then we have reactions from the community. Notice Andre Carpathy, he's right there. So, interestingly, it linked venture beat instead of X or Twitter where Andre actually posted it.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So, so if I had to nitpick, this is I would this is where I would do it. I'd prefer if it was a link to Karpathy's post, but I'm sure X doesn't just allow any chatbot, especially Chad GBT, to just crawl their website all willy-nilly. I'm sure there's some some limits to that. So, since VentureB sort of like created their article about it, it went to VentureB. This to me is an A+.

### 📋 セクション 66

I mean, it absolutely knocked it out of the park. Did exactly what it was supposed to. Guess maybe not an A+. I'll give it a solid A, maybe an A minus, but again, I don't think it easily crawl X.com, which is why it can't provide the original post. We'll actually test out to see how well it interacts with X in a second.

### ⭐ セクション 67

But again, very, very solid, taking into account the fact that it can't easily, most likely can't easily browse X. All right. Next, I want to see if it create a little audiobook for us. So, I said, "Log into 11 Labs and use a nice AI voice to create a short audio book about how amazing honey badgers are." All right. So, again, I had to help it log in.

### 📝 セクション 68

In the future, once I'm logged in, it has memory about stuff. This shouldn't be an issue. This should be a seamless process. But, it wrote out this script. It had Sarah voice it.

### 💡 セクション 69

So, let's listen to what it sounds like. >> Overall, the honey badger is a reminder that size doesn't determine strength. Its resilience, intelligence, and boldness make it one of the most amazing animals in the natural world. like a tiny superhero in the wild. >> Also, Honey Badger don't care.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Come on. This is terrific. Again, A+. Everything's perfect. Again, we can we can tell it to do more things or we can add various custom instructions if we do this repeatedly.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Maybe, hey, make sure you use this specific voice for everything, etc. But for a one-shot sort of like my first time doing this, again, it's oneshotting everything. So far, extremely impressive. And last, but certainly not least, I said, "Hey, I'm doing a video about opening eyes at Chad PT Atlas, do full research on it, what are the features, create a new Google doc, put all the details in there, and then write out a 30 to 60 second intro to the video about it, made it make it exciting and engaging." So, here's that. So, I went through to make sure that I got the details correctly.

### 💭 セクション 72

So, for example, it's going global. You know, it's being released globally to everybody, but only on Mac OS. I said before, but Windows users are secondass citizens. We are always forgotten about our features delayed. It's extremely frustrating.

### 📌 セクション 73

And it also got this right. So agent mode is kind of an early preview. It's available for plus pro and business subscribers. Again, this significance tab, this is most likely, I'm pretty sure this is because I have those special custom instructions where it's supposed to draw some insights or why it's important or significance, whatever you want to call it. So that's why it includes something like that everywhere.

### ✅ セクション 74

So here it says the browser also highlights the growing competition in AI powered browsing joint offerings from Perplexity Opera and the upcoming AI enhanced Chrome versions which is definitely a point that a lot of people have made. So Perplexity a lot of this is like Perplexity's Comet. So we'll see who makes a better product and who will have the most users in the end. Certainly, this is going to be very, very similar to Comet, at least at first glance. And it wrote a little video intro script.

### 📚 セクション 75

Imagine a browser that doesn't just take YouTube websites, but actively helps you understand them. Anyways, I think this is a solid A. There's one minor detail where I think if you make this, if you make Atlas your default browser, you get higher rate limits for 7 days. It's a minor detail, but kind of an interesting one, right? If you're experimenting with Fed, you just click make this my default and that gives you more read limits.

### 🔖 セクション 76

I wish it would have mentioned that. I don't see that anywhere in here. But let me know what you think. If you try it out, what do you think about it? Are you going to be using it actively?

### 🎨 セクション 77

Is this something that's going to be useful for you? How is this going to affect perplexity and comment? I'm looking forward to hearing more from you. My initial impression of this thing is that it's pretty dang good. Specifically, I'm talking about the agent mode.

### 🚀 セクション 78

It's very powerful, accurate, and actually does useful stuff. Now, time will tell if this is something I'm going be using daily or not. A lot of the stuff kind of seems very cool in the very beginning, but then you just don't end up using it. So, we'll do an update in a few weeks, but just first glance, this thing is getting better and better. And I feel like we're beginning to cross into this territory where it can actually do useful stuff for you on your behalf.

### ⚡ セクション 79

I haven't even tried doing the filling out forms of it or having it shop for me because again, it needs to have a whole bunch of information in there. But I feel like if you use it and it has that context over time, it will get to be very useful where it actually saves you time. But yeah, let me know what you think. Please hit thumbs up. Make sure you're subscribed.

### 🌟 セクション 80

and I'll see you in the next
