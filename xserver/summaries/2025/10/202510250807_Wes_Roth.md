## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Here's a quick app that I built in under an hour by Vibe Coding. Every time I finish a task in real life, my in-game hero gets stronger. I literally build a to-do app that's also an idol RPG. Complete quests, gain XP, and watch your hero out of battle while you work. It has users databases.

### 📋 背景・概要

It's hosted online. It even has payment integrations as well as some large language models that are built in, GPT40 in this case. And the craziest part, I built the whole thing using AI with Emergent, the sponsor of today's video. Emergent is the world's first agentic vibe coding platform that lets you go from idea to a full production ready app just by chatting with AI. It doesn't just design a UI.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

It builds your backend, handles payments, authentication, testing, and even deployment all inside one platform. First thing, zero setup. Emerge already includes native authentication. So login and sign up just work. No Superbase or Firebase required.

### 📝 詳細説明

It even gives you a built-in database. So your users and tasks are ready to store instantly. So here's what I'm building. A to-do list RPG where every completed task gives XP. That means experience.

### 💡 実例・デモ

You level up, unlock new abilities, and your character auto battles monsters while you focus on real life work. Completing your tasks helps your character progress in the game. I'll also add Stripe payments for premium features and a fun AI powered quest generator and storyline using emergence universal LM key which connects instantly to OpenAI Cloud or Gemini without needing to manage any API keys. For the agents, we're going to put E1.5 focused and diligent experimental model. Which model?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Well, we got the beefy cloud 4.5 sonnet 1 million context or perhaps the GPT5 beta. You know what? I'll let Claude handle this. Ultra thinking tokens. Yes, please.

### 🎯 応用例

I'm going to use midjourney to generate some of our artwork. I'm thinking this guy as our knight. And this fella can be our mage. We can always add more characters later. Next, we got some enemies.

### 💭 考察

What is happening here? Interesting fighting stance. Now, I'll create a few enemies. The skeleton. We got a minotaur wielding for some reason a candle, a cobalt.

### 📌 まとめ

We got a little imp/demon bandit. We'll call this one the imp lich. And we have a corrupted bear. This one cracks me up, but I think this is more our speed. We'll start with just five art pieces for now.

### ✅ 結論

And then I just explained what the names are. So I called the users avatar, hero knight, and the rest are the enemies. They all start with enemy underscore. These AI models are fairly good at understanding it. As long as you name the files, anything even remotely legible, it'll probably figure it out.

### 📚 追加情報

All right, let's click go. It's setting up the environment, reticulating splines, and now it's working on figuring out how to create the game. So, step one is thinking through the project, building almost like a not a timeline, but like a a project step-by-step checklist. And it's asking for some input. By the way, we can always say you figure it out and it will.

### 🔖 補足

But if you want to customize some stuff, we can. So, it's clarifying some details. For example, how should the auto battles work? One thing I absolutely love about how they did this, and I would not be surprised if you see some of the big AI labs maybe start copying them. Notice how they they ask a question about a specific mechanic in the game or whatever app you're building.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So they have a question and then they they give you a few multiplechoice sort of potential answers, right? A, B, and C. So for example, we can have real-time continuous battles. The hero constantly fights while app is open. We can have a turn-based battles triggered by task completion or an idle style battle that progresses even when tasks aren't being completed.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And they have five questions that they would like some input to. You can literally just answer 1 A, 2 B, 3 C, whatever. like one meaning that's the question that you asked and then C is how I want you to do it. So I'll give it some input about how the auto battler should work. I have something specific in mind.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So I'm going to say that the character is always fighting. By default, the progress is slow. For every task completed, the character gets energy. For each task completed, the character gets energy. Each energy unit is 1 hour of fast progress where a character advances maybe 4x or 10x faster.

### 🌟 セクション 16

We're going to have to obviously troubleshoot and play with it later for game testing to see what makes sense. And the user completing to-do items can earn up to 24 hours of energy every day. So if you do the stuff that you're supposed to do, then your little knight, your little avatar progresses faster. Later, we might add something where something horrible happens to the character if you don't do the important tasks. Next, it's asking what should leveling up unlock?

### 🎬 セクション 17

stat boost, active abilities for hero to use or visual upgrade to the hero or D. All of the above D. So here I'll put two D. So notice that's all I have to say. It thought through what it had to do.

### 📋 セクション 18

It came up with a few solutions. So I can choose one of those options and it will make that happen. Then we have task categories. So I'm thinking each task the user is going to set it to be easy, medium, or hard. So we're going to say B.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Four I'm going to pick C. Boss enemies appear at certain milestones. and five UI style. And notice it's uh it says dark fantasy matching the darker pixel art aesthetic. By the way, if you scroll up, it kind of unpacked these little icons that we gave it.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, it kind of took a look at them and understood what theme we're going for. Are you getting why this is the future? So, for five, we're going to say a it nailed what we're looking for. We're going to say please create everything in dark mode. So, at this point, emergence multi- aent system handles everything.

### 💡 セクション 21

The UI agent builds the front end automatically. Here you can see the design agent going to work. The backend agent writes the logic and roots. The testing agent checks both instantly to make sure it's working. So you might have noticed that there was an error that appeared in the app preview window.

### 🔧 セクション 22

That's the testing agent that's testing your output to see that it's actually working, catching the issues and fixing them. It did all that while I went to make myself a sandwich. Once it's done, it actually reports back to me saying the initial smoke test failed due to a small JSX typo, which I fixed. Good job, little robot. All right.

### 🎯 セクション 23

And here we have our game. We have the hero knight attack defense of leveling up HP, XP, and energy. They're automatically in the battle arena finding various monsters. As you can see here, you know, squaring up against the foes. Everything is moving very quickly now because they have some energy.

### 💭 セクション 24

How do you get more energy? Well, we scroll here. By the way, notice there's a battle log. Emergent lets you add real-time updates really quickly and simply. So, I wired up this live battle log that tells you how your hero is doing.

### 📌 セクション 25

It's a great touch for engagement. And at the bottom here, we have our quest log. Basically, the to-do list. Our to-do lists, aka our quests, can be hard tasks. And we get to select the difficulty.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, for example, when we create it, there's our hard task. There's our medium task. And here's our easy task. As you can see here, it's showing our rewards. We can delete them or complete them.

### 📚 セクション 27

Notice when we complete them, the energy bar goes up. The only problem I ran into it is some of the visibility was poor, so I asked it to add some borders just to make it a little bit more high contrast. Next, we're going to use emergence universal LM key to generate random quests. lore and story line. Make it dark and have it fit the theme of the app.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, Emergent gets the needed libraries, the needed packages and tests to make sure that the quest generation feature is working. And says perfect, the AI quest generation is working beautifully. And here's our new addition AI generates a quest. And if we click it, let's see what happens. Unravel the web of deceitful taxes.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, notice that it integrated emergence universal LM key. It's using, in this case, Open EI's GBT40 Mini. Here's the thing, that feature is pretty cool, but that's not quite what I had in mind, and I just realized that I explained it poorly because for quests, referring to quests as our to-do list. What I had in mind was more a story line in the battle log. So, what happens now?

### 🚀 セクション 30

Is it a game over? Are we stuck with this new feature? Well, not quite. With Emergent, I can just roll back to a previous state, either just to chat or both chat and code. It's all connected to GitHub, so I can push and pull versions just like developers do.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Or I can fork my current progress and start a new path to try to develop it in a different direction. Everything gets summarized and you get to start it in a new instance. Get a fresh context window with a clean slate for new tasks. As you can see here, this is where I asked it to generate the random quests and every step I can roll back. So, anything from there on in very tight intervals, I can roll back to those saved checkpoints.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Now, here's the thing. This app isn't just webbased. Emergent also builds mobile apps using Expo. So, you can get a QR code, install it on Android or iOS, and it's production ready. Perfect for checking off tasks and seeing your progress while you're on the go.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Here I asked to create a mobile version of the app. Now we can preview it here or deploy it. Now before we hit deploy, let's add one more thing cuz it feels like we're missing something, right? What does every great app needs? Hm.

### 📋 セクション 34

Oh, it's monetization. I can connect Stripe using emergence builtin payments feature. No SDK setup or extra APIs. We're going to tell it to add monetization using Stripe at a $9.99 per month subscription. This unlocks faster progression and custom art.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Let's go. So, it starts out by integrating Stripe payment processing for subscriptions. It creates an env file to store the API key, which is smart to make sure that your private keys stay private. And now it's adding Stripe integration to the back end. The agent Neo, by the way, is the agent's name.

### 📝 セクション 36

He's saying, "I'll add the subscription, models, routes, and premium features." By the way, at any point you can see your code. Get a VS code link. So, you have access to all the code. The code is yours. And now we have this beautiful golden button here.

### 💡 セクション 37

Let's click it. Ah, unlock premium power. I love it. So, as you can see here, we have a premium monthly payment, $9.99 per month, faster progression, custom AI quest art, premium badge. And if we click on upgrade to premium, it takes us to the Stripe checkout screen.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So here's the Stripe checkout screen, $9.99, and you fill out information here. Now, this is just the test mode, but this is more or less what it would look like in real life. So, it mentions that you're using a test Stripe API key. And we'll go ahead and hit deploy now. And now for the best part, deployment.

### 🎯 セクション 39

With one click, I can publish the app, connect my custom domain, and it's live. Emergent ships production grade apps, not demos. You own your code, your data. There's no platform lockin. We can run a quick health check before deploying our website.

### 💭 セクション 40

As you can see, that triggers the reviewer agent, which runs a comprehensive health check and deployment readiness assessment for the epic to-do RPG application. I'm considering renaming it to Quest and Conquer. Notice it has some key features to verify backend API endpoints working front end serving properly. Database connections stable. By the way, as I mentioned before, all the data is saved in the databases.

### 📌 セクション 41

There's a login screen. You can log out like this. This is a fully functional login screen, right? You enter your email, password, register if you haven't done so already. Your data gets saved.

### ✅ セクション 42

This is again a production grade app. I added this login asdev quick start just so I can bypass that screen for testing purposes. The last thing I'll do is disable that. There's tons of checks it runs for Stripe API authentication, MongoDB, etc., etc. The reviewer agent found that mostly everything is great.

### 📚 セクション 43

One sort of thing that should be fixed says is there's one hardcoded API key that should be moved to the Enva file, but all critical deployment requirements are met. Notice that's the reviewer agent message. At which point the edit agent takes over and he goes, "Good catch. This feels like a a team of developers working for me developing my silly little games or I meant to say the next billion dollar startup they envisioned." So notice here. So it it knows that that was an issue because the reviewer agent tagged it.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So it fixes it and it gives me a report deployment readiness check. Looks good. We are now ready for deployment. We're going to hit start deployment. It does mention that we're using a test stripe key.

### 🎨 セクション 45

That's totally fine for now. And I'm going to click deploy now. As you can see, it's going to build the package, migrate the database, etc., etc. Deploy, and run a final health check. If you're wondering if it's going to reticulate splines, it will.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Don't worry. And now our app is deployed. Let's check it out. And there it is. It's online.

### ⚡ セクション 47

You can register, log in. For the time being, let's log in as a dev. Everything is looking really good. We're able to link and host it on our custom domains. We can continually add to it and redeploy the new versions.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So now when I complete my realworld tasks, my hero fights monsters, gains XP, and levels up automatically. The entire app authentication, payments, database backend, and LM integration was built entirely by AI. I've used other Vibe coding tools, but they all stop at flashy front ends. Emergent goes end to end with authentication, back-end integrations, deployment, testing, mobile, all with one conversation. It's already the number one coding agent on Sui Bench with over 1.5 million builders and 15 million annual recurring revenue in just a few months.

### 🎬 セクション 49

That means that people are using this to build real stuff. If you want to turn your very own idea into an app, whether it's a productivity tool or a mobile game or your next startup, try Emergent. They've got full guides on building apps, creating agents, and integrating payments. Check the link below to start building. I never thought checking off a to-do list would feel like defeating a boss.

### 📋 セクション 50

Huge thanks to Emergent for sponsoring this video and giving me the tools to build something actually alive. I'll see you in the next one. I'll be leveled up by then. Make sure that you are too.
