## 💡 概要

Google DeepMindがリリースしたGemini 2.5 Computer Useモデルを使用したMCP（Model Context Protocol）サーバーの実装とデモを紹介する動画です。このモデルはコンピューター画面を認識し、ブラウザやmacOSアプリを自動操作できる機能を持っています。動画では、実際にファイルを検索して開く、Webフォームを自動入力する、ターミナルでPythonコードを実行するなど、様々な実用例が紹介されています。AI開発者やエージェント技術に興味がある方向けの技術解説動画です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **Gemini 2.5 Computer Useの特徴**：画面のスクリーンショットを取得し、マウスやキーボード操作を実行できるAIモデル。ブラウザ操作とmacOSアプリ制御の2つのモードを実装
- **MCP統合でClaude Codeと連携**：4つのブラウザツールと4つのmacOSツールを実装し、Claude経由でGemini 2.5の機能を利用可能に
- **実用例①：ファイル検索と再生**：Macのファインダーで特定のmp4ファイルを検索し、右クリックメニューからQuickTime Playerで開くまでを自動実行（やや遅いが正確）
- **実用例②：フォーム自動入力**：RoboFormのテストページで、映画「マトリックス」のネオになりきって全フィールドを自動入力。複雑なフォームも処理可能
- **課題と今後の展望**：実行速度はまだ遅く、ターミナル操作では非効率な部分も見られるが、Claudeの初期Computer Useモデルよりは大幅に改善。MCPとの組み合わせで実用性が向上

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Hey chat GPT start computer use to create GPT6. Google deep mind released a new Gemini 2.5 computer use model uh a few days ago maybe yesterday already I think so. So today uh I built an MCP server that is using this uh computer use model. So I have kind of two stages. One is browser use and one is controlling my Mac here.

### 📋 背景・概要

Right. So, uh it's pretty interesting and the MCP server is working great. So, today I just want to take you through a few different use cases uh how we can use this computer use model from Gemini to yeah control our computer or our browser. So, let's just get into it and I can show you a few things we can do with this. To show you this uh we are going to use cloud code.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, I'm just going to go to cloud code here. I'm going to do my I have a global one for this. So/MCP you can see computer use this the only one we have here and if you look at the tools now I kind of did this in two different um yeah I can quickly show you the code here but we have four tools for browser use and we have four tools for open Mac as u Mac OS app control app do a screenshot and actions and we have the same for browser use right screenshot and execute actions so if you look at the code here I'm not going to go through the code but you can see we have one uh TypeScript for browser and we have one for MacOSS right and in the index we kind of reference to both so we can control them uh yeah you can see some examples here uh but I don't want to spend too much time on this here's kind of our type definitions like I said X screenshot Mac screenshot browser and you kind of get the point uh if people want to dive deeper into this let me know if you are interested in the exact code here But the idea today is just show you how this work in practice and kind of how well this model performs in real use cases. So I think I want to start off with a MacOSS use case. Then we can do a browser use case and maybe finish with the favorite use case I created.

### 📝 詳細説明

Uh yeah, you will see that in the end of the video. So let's just start with something simple here for the the Mac OS app. So, uh, I think it was last week before the new Taylor Swift album, I asked Sunno to create like a new try to guess what the songs were going to be on that new album. And it created a song called Elizabeth. Yeah, it's an uh video file ismpp4.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And we're going to ask the computer to find this uh on my Mac and rightclick the file and open it with a quick time player. So, I'm just going to hit enter now. And we're going to see the MCP server. Now do some yeah commands to this model. Right?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

If you wait a second, you can see tool use here. Find the file name uh here on the computer. Right click, open the quick time player. Max turns 15. So we have like a limit on turns here.

### 🎯 応用例

So I'm just going to say yes. So now, of course, I'm hands off. You can see that. So this is going to try to use the tools we created with the MCP uh with the model now. Okay.

### 💭 考察

So we got some errors here. So, it needs to maybe do a smaller screenshots. Let's try that again. Uh, okay. So, now you can see it went to the finder.

### 📌 まとめ

It's probably going to do some kind of search. Let's see. Okay. So, it's clicked on search. That's good.

### ✅ 結論

So, let's see if it types in Elizabeth, I would say. I would guess would be the best the thing to do here. Yeah, it's doing Elizabeth MP4. Great. So, it found that.

### 📚 追加情報

So, now it should just rightclick it and do open with QuickTime player. Okay, so it's going into archive. So it should do open w with or open me here in Norwegian and it should do quicktime player. So let's see if it finds that. Okay, so open with and we have quicktime player and hopefully that should open up the video.

### 🔖 補足

So you can see it's not very fast, but it is pretty good at actually finding the right pixels. Okay, good. So I don't know if it's going to click play here. Let's see. Okay.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, I would say that was task completed. So, you can see it found it, opened it, and played it. So, yeah, it's playing the content. Uh, so I think that was a pretty good job. Wasn't really fast.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I would do it, of course, much faster, but I think it executed pretty well on controlling my computer here. So now let's go over to the browser use case and see if we can do that. Okay, so I wanted to see if we can do some uh filling out some forms. So we have this robo form here test. Yeah, something we can do here, right?

### ⚡ セクション 15

We can test this to fill out forms. So I'm going to go to my MCP server. I have a big film uh form to fill out. I'm going to do the URL. Help me fill out all of this.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Uh the assignment should is to role play as Neo from Matrix, right? So just make up something to fill out. So what happens when we run this now? So this is not going to be opened in Chrome now. This is going to be opened in um uh Chromium I guess.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Play right. So you can see we're going to do the screenshot page or I'm not quite sure. Maybe you're going to do it something else. Uh I think it's just going to be the Chromium one, right? Yeah.

### 📋 セクション 18

So we go to this robo form filler here. We do a screenshot. And now I think we go back to computer use and planning out back to the cloud code agent to plan out what we're going to fill out. So we go back in again. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So we did that extra evaluated. It's scrolled down just to see the full page. And now it's going to fill out the form as Nate Neo from Matrix. You can see here it's doing the plan. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 20

I'm going to say yes to that. Okay. So we go back to the robo form. Uh now I kind of want to see it start filling out this. Right.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, we should just press got it there on the cookies and start filling out uh because it has all the information it needs now, I think. Yeah, you can see we start with Mister and it's probably going to be Thomas, isn't that Thomas Anderson? Yeah. So, I'm just going to speed this up and I'll be back when uh let's see how far we can if we can do the full thing. I'm not quite sure because of the turns, but let's see how far we get here.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Okay, as you probably saw, it closed down the page, but you can you kind of saw it filled out all the forms. So, not I think it stopped uh on a few last of the fields because we didn't have any more turns here. I could have up the max turns, but that's fine. Uh it did actually do what we asked for and I think it worked pretty good. So, uh I want to do a final test and that is going to be back on the MacOSS use and we're going to do some terminal stuff.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, let's see how that uh works. Okay, so the final thing I wanted to do was to use the computer, use MCP, open up cursor, create a file, uh, hello YouTube.py, add Python code to print hello YouTube, then execute this code. Uh, I'm just going to set the max turn to 15. So, let's just see what happens now. Are we going to go into cursor?

### 💭 セクション 24

Are we going to go open up a new version? Let's just see. I haven't tried this before. Okay, so I guess we went straight to cursor. Um, does it even know how to navigate this?

### 📌 セクション 25

I'm not quite sure. Okay, so we did a new file at least. So, let's see what happens now. It's probably going to screenshot this. And it should just be able to Where is that file?

### ✅ セクション 26

Is it this? Okay, so it's that's not going too well. Why is it writing so strangely? Maybe I should set that on a region European keyboard. I'm not quite sure.

### 📚 セクション 27

Okay, so now it's trying to save the file, I guess. So it's called it some kind of untitled Hello Python. Okay, that's it's not perfect, but I guess it's fine. Okay, so it is actually doing a fine job saving here, I guess. But we also need the code in this file.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Okay, so now we have the Python here. Let's see if we can actually do the coding code here. Okay, so it looks like we did the correct code here. So it's print hello YouTube. That looks better.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So now it has to save this before we can run it. Why is it doing a new agent? So, I'm not quite sure if it's just going to go to file or save or if it's just going to do control uh command s. Okay, so it did save it. So, it's going to Python hello YouTube.py can open it.

### 🚀 セクション 30

No such file. Was it the wrong file? I did a plus sign. Okay, so let's see what it's going to do then. Okay, so it clicked on the split edit or why?

### ⚡ セクション 31

Just click on the play now and we should be good to go. I don't know if it knows the keyboard layout. I'm not quite sure what's going on here now. It's trying to change the name of the file. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Okay. So, it changed the name to hello.py. Okay. Why is it doing a new terminal now? It's so close now.

### 🎬 セクション 33

It just has to run the Python code and we should be good to go here. Okay. So, why did it close the terminal now? That was very strange. Okay.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, it has the terminal now at least again. So all it has to do now is do python hello yt.py and we should be done here. Okay, so we're doing a screenshot. Okay, finally. That took forever.

### ⭐ セクション 35

That was very unefficient, but we got there in the end. Okay, that's fine, I guess. Uh but uh yeah, that wasn't too impressive, but it was cool, but not very impressive. But overall, I think this new model is h quite exciting. Uh, I had a lot of fun with it setting up this MCP, trying out different stuff.

### 📝 セクション 36

Uh, there were some clips I didn't include. I tried to do some painting uh on paint and I did some other stuff with Yeah, maybe in another video. Uh, but there's a lot of fun things you can do with this. Is this perfect now? I don't think so.

### 💡 セクション 37

Uh, but it's getting incrementally better. It's much better than the first time I tried the cloud computer use. and it's just keep uh upping each other these different model providers. So, it is a step forward and it's going to be interesting to see where this part of the stack goes. And it's pretty interesting when you combine it with an MCP tool and you can just get access to more context and your context engineering can get like a bump up in level if you find the right use cases for it.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Uh, I had a lot of fun playing around with my Mac computer uh, controls, but it's a bit risky, so I don't know if I recommend it. But go check it out. Gemini 2.5 computer use model. Thank you for tuning in. Have a great day, and I'll see you again soon.
