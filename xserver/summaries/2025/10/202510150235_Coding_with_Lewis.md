## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This food app wanted $20, so I rebuilt it for free. [music] Yuka is an app that scans a barcode for food and gives you a rating based on if it's good for you or if it's not. [music] Now, you have the option to pay, which I mean, it's a free app. You should probably do it anyway, but not me. First, we can get a barcode scanner package.

### 📋 背景・概要

It essentially just scans a barcode and translates it into a large number that you can use. Then, we go to openfoodfax.org or that has a free API. Did I say free? Free where you search items by Can you take a wild guess on what you search for? [laughter] Right.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

A large number from a barcode. Then all of your data right there at your fingertips. Like I'm not joking. It's literally everything. Then you just create a small UI with all the relevant metrics, metadata, you know, that are good and bad.

### 📝 詳細説明

And voila. That $7 million could have been mine. But you know what? Shout out to Yuka the goats. Okay, I'm not going to rain on their parade.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Sometimes [music] being petty just pays off. What app should I recreate next? by mina.
