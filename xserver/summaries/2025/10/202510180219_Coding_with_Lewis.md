## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This Chrome extension turns work into Elden Ring. Elden Ring is a game that is notoriously hard. So, when you hit a checkpoint, you get this really satisfying [music] sound, but when you die, you hear this heartwrenching sound. Why did I do that? So, Salty, sorry if I'm not saying that right, decided to bring this to GitHub pull request.

### 📋 背景・概要

So when you finish a feature or a bug fix and open a pull request, you can feel the satisfaction of opening up that pull request and finishing up the code that you so desperately needed to do. But here's the issue. If your code doesn't perform, you also get that punch in the gut that you have to do this all over again and you die in real life. I got issues here. This all came from a viral tweet where they implemented it in their Gmail whenever you sent an email.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

[music] And honestly, I just wish I had this across all of my productivity applications. Like imagine doing a Zoom meeting with someone you don't like and then it's like, ah, there we go. It was all worth it in the end. And this is why sometimes you have to work with your brain and not against it. Um, praise the sun.

### 📝 詳細説明

Best Alen ring, right? That alen ring.
