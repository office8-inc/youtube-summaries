## 💡 概要

長時間稼働するAIエージェントの構築方法を実演する動画です。Claude Codeと独自開発のMCPサーバーを使用して、5分間・10分間といった時間指定でリサーチタスクを実行するエージェントを構築しています。AIエージェントがX（旧Twitter）やRedditからリアルタイムで情報を収集し、Web ページを自動更新する実践的なデモを通じて、タイムベースのタスク管理方法を解説。AI開発者やエージェント技術に興味がある方に最適な内容です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **長時間稼働AIエージェント**は数時間〜数日間持続し、メモリとチェックポイントを維持しながら自律的にタスクを実行
- **MCPサーバー**（Grok、Reddit）を活用してX.comやRedditから情報を収集し、リアルタイムでWebページを更新
- **タイムベースタスク**により、5分・10分など指定時間内で自動的にリサーチを完了し、時間切れで自動停止
- Claude 4.5は**30時間以上の複雑なタスクに集中できる**とAnthropicが発表
- 実験結果：10分間のリサーチの方が5分間より詳細な情報を収集できるが、情報量のバランス調整が重要

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, Sam, what is a longunning AI agent? >> A longrunning AI agent is an autonomous stateful software process that can persist for hours or days, maintaining memory and checkpoints. >> It can plan and execute multi-step goals, call external tools and APIs, monitor progress, recover from failures, and keep working without constant user prompts. >> At least that's what chat GPT told me. Okay, so what you heard in that intro that was made with Sora 2 by the way.

### 📋 背景・概要

Pretty fun tool if you ask me. Uh today I want to take a quick look at what they call longunning AI agents. So the way I want to define this is uh a longunning AI agent is an autonomous stateful software process that can persist for hours or days. Okay, we're not going to do days. Maintaining memory checkpoints so it can plan execute multi-step goals.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Call external tools. That could be MCP servers that we're going to use today. APIs, monitor progress, recover from failures, keep working with constant user prompts or without constant user prompts. So we should kind of give like a goal and it should work towards that goal. We're going to introduce something else that I call time tasks.

### 📝 詳細説明

I will show you that. Uh but we are going to use cloud code today. uh and I built some MCP servers to help us do research and help us execute uh the task we want to do while staying inside this uh time task window that is going to keep the agent running over a longer time actually to do a yeah to try to do a task and execute some goals we have set. So let's start over here in the terminal. Let's go to claude right.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Uh you can see we are in the long agent directory here as you can see on top here. And for this directory I have built some MCP tools. So the tools we have these are my global tools Gemini and Jitub. You can just ignore those. But we have a gro server.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Uh the tools here is that we can search x.com. We can look for handles. We can look for popular post. That is some tools we have. Or um we have the Reddit server that can kind of do the same on Reddit.

### 🎯 応用例

do research, find posts, search for post, right, that is on Reddit. And I have a tool here called uh Reddit um no research display. This is going to create like a live up uh real time web page that we can compile all the research and we can update this in real time. You'll kind of see how it works when we start this now. So uh we also have some other tools.

### 💭 考察

These are kind of the builtin tools. If we go to where can we see those n tora so these are the tools like web search fetch and everything so I don't need an MCP server to do a web search uh so what we want to do now uh you can see here is that uh in my claw MD file uh I have something called important if you are on a timebased task always adhere to the time spent on a task also don't ever stop working before the time is up. Okay, this is a bit important. This is the way I like to do uh long running tasks. You can there's there's a bunch of way to do it, but this is a very simple way if you just want to get started.

### 📌 まとめ

So, let's look at my starting prompt now. So, here it is. So, you can see your next task is timebased. The agent should do 5 minutes of research using MCP servers and tools and make live updates and improvements on the web page on the topic Sora 2. Is it's over now?

### ✅ 結論

I was supposed to do is it over now. Okay, so like this uh write an in-depth article marks three paragraphs, bullet points. Goal is to find a sor 2 video to embed. Keep updating and refining. Don't just add content.

### 📚 追加情報

Use uh update and refine the existing. We have adding relevant images and video that involves the topic if applicable. The time frame for a job like I said 5 minutes. keep count of this time in a background task and hard stop for research after 5 minutes. So here we kind of have the timebased task.

### 🔖 補足

I only want agents this time to work for 5 minutes. We're going to run do a second run where I do 10 minutes and we're going to check out the differences. So I'm just going to start this now and you can see what's going to happen now is I think the first thing is to start the timer. It should be we can just look at use like a background batch task here. Yeah, we have yeah we have a sleep 300.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So I'm just going to accept that. And you can see down here one background task running. So this is counting now to 5 minutes. 300 seconds is 5 minutes. And here you can see we are already starting the tool call.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So we are doing web search. We are searching for OpenAI video generation. So what I can do now is I can open up my local host 3000 to check out the live server. So you can see there's no content here. Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So here we got the content right. So it did a quick update here on the web page. Let me just adjust this a bit. So you can see Sora 2 is it over now? And this made some updates.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I guess it's kind of behind my head now. You but you can see we have done some updates here now. Uh yeah in the real time. So you can see we are still using Grock here. We are going to X looking for information.

### 🎬 セクション 17

We are doing some Reddit searches. So I'm just going to let this run now. I'm going to record this so you can see the changes in real time and I'll come back when the five minutes uh has uh completed here. [Music] Okay. So you can see uh the bash output now time is up.

### 📋 セクション 18

So 5 minutes have passed. Yes, this worked perfectly. So now we kind of adhere to that 5 minute research complete and we stopped. Perfect. That's what I wanted to see.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And we have some key findings here. Uh unfortunately we couldn't embed an actual Sora 2 video. Okay. Uh, that's fine, I guess. Uh, let's take a look at the results here.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, you can see we have the title. Not even close. Sora 2 just launched and it's already defining AI video released 30th of Dece September. Calling it the chat Gypty 3 opponent for video. Okay.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, yeah. Uh, this looks to be uh legit information. Uh, but it's not very good. We didn't get any images and stuff, but that was not the point. The point was just to test this out and see how it works.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Uh, now we can use our tool to just clear this because we're going to do a 10-minute run. Clear content. This should trigger the MCP tool to actually remove this content, right? Because we are running this in real time. Yep, there we go.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, now we're just going to do I think we're just going to clear this, right? And we're going to send off the same prompt. Uh, but this time it's going to be 10 minutes. So, we just do the same prompt, but we changed the timing here. So, I'm going to do Yeah, I updated everything to 10 minutes.

### 💭 セクション 24

And yeah, let's just run it again and see if there's any difference running this task for 5 minutes uh or 10 minutes. Okay. Yeah, sleep 600. Perfect. Background task is running.

### 📌 セクション 25

Yeah. So, again, I'm just going to let this run and I'll be right back. [Music] Okay, so you can see the 10 minutes research task was completed. If you scroll up here, you can see the bash output was uh 10 minutes has elapsed, time is up. And again, it adhere to that instruction and it just stopped the research.

### ✅ セクション 26

So that is perfect. That means that we can try to scale this even more. We could set 30 minute research task, right? And just keep blowing on here. And we can just change this setup to other stuff.

### 📚 セクション 27

We can do coding, maybe some time task on working on a code, writing tests, and expanding uh on features. Uh yeah, you can see basically uh we did pretty much the same, but we just spent longer time. So if you look at the output, uh I guess it was pretty good for me. This was a bit too expensive. We added an image, so that was a nice touch, but uh this was too much information if you ask me.

### 🔖 セクション 28

We didn't really ask for that. Uh but this is just adjustments we can do in the prompting, right? Uh the main core idea today was to see if we could keep the task running for the set time we set, right? And maybe for a future video, we can do like a coding task that is going to be like 30 minutes long just to see how that works. uh because if we take a look at kind of the statement from open from anthropic they said that uh cloud 4.5 is a state of the art on the swbench verified uh practically speaking they observed it maintaining focus for more than 30 hours on complex multi-step task uh I think you will need a good framework for that but maybe it's possible I'm not sure how exactly they did this uh but we did 10 minutes this is 30 hours that's a whole different ball game of uh running this long running agent task.

### 🎨 セクション 29

But um yeah, like I said, I hope this was interesting and I hope this gave you some ideas on how you can start learning playing around with uh setting this longunning agent task and maybe you can do it time based as I did or you can do it goal based. There's a lot of ways to choose here. Uh but all in all, a very interesting thing and it's just going to get more and more of this uh implemented into your workflow. Uh, at least that's what I think and you might as well just start playing around with it now so you have some idea uh what people talk about when they say longunning AI agents. So yeah, thank you for tuning in.
