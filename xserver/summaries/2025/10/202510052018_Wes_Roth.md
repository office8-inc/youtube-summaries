## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Let's start with what everybody's talking about which is Sora. >> Sora >> Sora 2. What was your impression so far? >> You know, I have been shocked. I you know I at first I was like okay it's like V3 there's these tools they add audio they do pretty good visuals but now that I've spent uh several days creating content realizing the power of the way that it's built sort of in the short form format including being integrated into essentially a Tik Tok competitor.

### 📋 背景・概要

I mean you can tell that's where the that's where this is going. Um it it's such a it's just like such a better experience and it's probably going to be so much more impactful and profitable than V3 and the same kind of model. So that the packaging of the tool with the tool, the game plan for it, it just feels like this is something worth paying attention to. >> Yeah. And one thing that's I think very interesting is that so I kind of had this epiphany maybe is is basically about where openi is going and seeing a lot of people talk about this online as well but basically so it seems like they're creating a lot of stuff that's going to match them up against Google a little bit more because already they have a big reach.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Um I'm sure a lot more people I I know I am searching on chajipt now a lot more than I used to on Google. So my Google use is going down as my Chadypty use is going up. Um now they also want to monetize the free users. How do you do that? Well, they announced Pulse.

### 📝 詳細説明

Pulse is kind of like a daily sort of news thing that gives you your personalized news. It's an algorithmic feed that you control. So you can say I want to see less of this, more of this, etc. I mean that's an incredible way to monetize users by serving them ads. Sora 2 is a social network.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Guess what? We're going to have um ads appearing there soon. Eventually, 100%. >> Okay. I was going to ask about that.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

You feel like that's that's coming soon. >> Absolutely. I mean, it's one of those things where every single platform once it gets big enough, it starts doing ads. It's just a way to to monetize at scale. Um it's too sweet of a sort of revenue opportunity to ignore.

### 🎯 応用例

And I mean, you know, we've seen how easily ads are integrated into Tik Tok and Google Shorts, how easy it is to get somebody to pop into a live stream, a promoted live stream, etc. So, and think about how easy it's going to be to slip ads in the AI generated content. already there's tons of people on X right now saying how that UCG user UGC user generated content got a lot of yeah uh e-commerce brands use those influencers those people are no longer need it because you can easily create something in Sora 2 where it's a usually a very pretty female holding up the product going oh my god I can't believe this product blah blah blah it's amazing buy it something along those lines that can be 100% AI generated And you can, you know, in those few split seconds, if they can hold your attention for 3 seconds, 5 seconds, you can do a pretty effective pitch on a product. So, this is just ripe for ads, I feel like. You know what?

### 💭 考察

I've You've probably heard me kind of rail on the whole thing that I'm not I don't love the idea of an AI system being powered by ads because it's literally going to lead to manipulation. It just seems like the last thing I want is the advertisement to be generated specifically to target my weaknesses. >> Um, and that's what could happen here. Like this could be the kind of content that is just generated on the fly, maybe specifically for each person. And um, yeah, I don't know.

### 📌 まとめ

>> Does that worry you at all or do you think that'll be okay? Will they be able to put walls up that'll make you trust it? >> 100%. It worries me. Not so much with the Tik Tok AI slop whatever like that that's not my biggest concern.

### ✅ 結論

My biggest concern is more like you know when I use Chad GPT for research I don't want the answers to be influenced by ads right so I if I'm looking for the best product I wanted to find the best product based on the research that I did and I'd be like oh but you know if I promote this thing we get paid. So definitely my fear is more in that sort of searchbased how do how do ads affect that? And so we're going to have to see how they build that out because there's a obviously a wrong and a right way of doing it. Um in terms of ads that are in the entertainment things like on on you know Sora, Tik Tok, etc. that doesn't concern me as much um as there there's certain places where you you can't have that ad influence, right?

### 📚 追加情報

So doctors shouldn't be prescribing stuff based on how much they get paid to prescribe that stuff, right? You know what I mean? >> Right. Of course not. Yeah.

### 🔖 補足

Does >> news shouldn't cover stuff that benefits them. So there's there's certain sources of information that should be sort of untouched by that commercial interest. Um, and that's to me now Chad GPT is becoming that for me more and more. The the Tik Tok whatever, not so much. You know what I mean?

### 🎨 セクション 13

It's still not great, but just not as big of a concern. >> Right. Okay. So, Pulse, checkout, and Sora. So, let's talk about the actual content in a second, but um, what do you think about Checkout?

### 🚀 セクション 14

Is that going to be do you see it all coming together here? I mean, I feel like if they sort of win, if they if if this plan works out and they they're able to scale it up, I mean, they become sort of the next Google. All right? Because the amount of shopping online. So, they've already integrated Etsy and they're working on integrating Shopify.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, outside of like the big brands like Amazon, Walmart, right? sort of like the giants. The medium-siz stores and a lot of large stores and all the small stores mostly run on Shopify. So, it's kind of that platform for third party sellers. That's I I did e-commerce for close to a decade.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I've used mostly Shopify. That's the the only um platform I've personally used other than being on Etsy and Amazon and those other marketplaces. Um but Shopify has got the biggest reach. It's got it's it's a has a massive presence. So if Chad GPT starts integrating cho uh with Shopify and driving traffic to Shopify, I mean that really changes the game I think for a lot of sellers.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So all of a sudden you got to start thinking about not just SEO, search engine optimization. You got to whatever chat or whatever, you know, how do you optimize chat GBT to drive stuff to your um to your store? And obviously that's another big opportunity to to place ads. And that's a whole thing. I do want to I I know it's going to be big if they if they manage to get it right.

### 📋 セクション 18

Um, I would love to talk to somebody in that field to to maybe get some insight into how they're going to sort of do it and and what the actual like technical approaches will be. But this feels big between Pulse Shopping, you know, checkout and Sora, man, they have so much room and >> absolutely. I mean, I was thinking about how so this gorilla on stage has this chain, right? Like why couldn't that chain have been generated from an item that's on Amazon right now? Like why not, right?

### ⭐ セクション 19

Like does it have to be a generic chain? And truly does it even need to be labeled as an ad? Because if this guy if you wanted the chain on the gorilla making the joke or whatever he's doing the rap like I don't know. I just feel like it's all so going to be so integrated. And I mean this video of you like that wets suit, you could just click on the wets suit and order it from Amazon.

### 📝 セクション 20

or this fishing pole or this Mario game, you know, like it's just the integration is going to be so tightly coupled to the content that's generated. It's going to look different than any model we've had before. I don't know what labeling is going to look like. I don't know what people are going to feel the differences between an advertisement and a regular piece of content, but this bridge can be closed if if that's what they want from the business. One thing that YouTube recently did or in the process of doing is now it's going to allow YouTubers to insert their sponsorships and take them in and out of videos.

### 💡 セクション 21

So instead of uploading the whole video with your sponsorship already sort of spliced in there, it's going to allow you to put it in, take it out. So, it's acting almost more as a um I'm seeing a lot of the same stuff on my feed as as >> there's not that much content on the whole channel yet, you know. >> Um >> like the whole network. >> Yeah. But anyways, I do want to show people some of the stuff that that I I saw.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, some of it is is surprisingly pretty good. Um but to to finish my thought, so the idea of now thinking of this as real estate where you can come in and out and put things in and splice things in. So like with the gorilla example that you had, it's wearing a chain. I I think it's going to be very realistic to put in a product not just the beginning, right? So, not if you just thought of it when you're generating, but if it takes off, it goes viral, somebody reaches out, hey, I'll pay you to put my chain in in that gorilla or whatever on that gorilla's neck, and you're going to be able to >> Oh, it the other way.

### 🎯 セクション 23

>> Yeah. So, the they, you know, they can pay you on a 30-day basis like, "Hey, for 30 days, put this on there or whatever CPM or whatever." So I feel like the advertising aspect is going to be so much more integrated with this AI generate stuff. And again, >> wow, that's, you know, that's a mind-blowing idea because now all of a sudden in the back, so if you've ever placed an ad on Instagram, you kind of know there's demographics, right? Like you could do women or men or you can do like this de this like geography, the city, the state, uh the kind of people who like this interest. Yeah, if if now what you're saying is that you can place your item out onto content and almost everybody has an AI that customizes it for them, you can probably just click something that says people who will buy it, you know, or like this exact demographic and it's going to be able to figure that whole thing out.

### 💭 セクション 24

I mean, we've seen the algorithm update now on YouTube, so it it takes a guess as to whether you're underage or not. You know, that same guessing could be applied to where that gorilla chain ends up. Yeah. And I mean just so people know where I mean I'm coming from and I think Dylan's probably the same way. So it's not that we're necessarily like excited about this stuff.

### 📌 セクション 25

It's more like you know we kind of I think most people realize where it's going. So we do want to make sure that we're sort of talking about where things are going. That's not necessarily I mean am I happy about there being more AI generated content and AI influencers and this ultra customized marketing stuff being so much easier to interweave into content. Do I think that makes the world a better place? Not not necessarily.

### ✅ セクション 26

But you know that's where this is going. >> Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, I did it did kind of feel like an epiphany when I thought about how advertising will change but change, but not cuz I need that in the world just cuz I can just see how big that's going to be for these people. >> Exactly.

### 📚 セクション 27

Absolutely. >> Yeah. And the other thing about the integration is there's so many um how do you put this like there's this I don't know I guess I kind of thought I kind of lost my thought, but the idea of everybody getting their own piece of content is just it just changes kind of everything that I've thought about. It's it's not channel surfing. It's not clicking through YouTube videos.

### 🔖 セクション 28

It's just different. It just changes so much about what it means to like, have you actually sat and just scrolled the platform the same way you would Instagram reels or Tik Tok or YouTube shorts? >> So, I'm very careful to avoid I don't have Facebook or Instagram. >> Well, I just made Instagram, I think, because we were talking about it. So, I'm I'm at some point probably need to start posting on there.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Um, Tik Tok I've avoided when it just came out. It was big. I tried it and I felt like it just would suck me into this hole and then time would go by and I couldn't break out of it. Like something about it I was like this is like we went too far with this addiction element. So I I don't touch it.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And then I don't like the fact that it's coming to YouTube now. I I don't like that. Here it's a little bit different. Um because number one really I'm not a fan of just watching the crap go by. But really what I'm excited about what I thought it was super interesting is the cameo appearances.

### ⚡ セクション 31

>> Yes talk about that. >> Yeah. And so there's been a few articles that were out about this stuff. So because this is so new I think a lot of people still don't understand what it is. So maybe we should take a second to um explain to people what it is.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So each person on here >> I'm out on the city >> uh is able to >> is able to create their own avatar AI avatar if you will by basically recording your face. You got to say a few things um and then if anything checks out then um you're able to you know use something like this. Type in some words and then it puts you in that situation. Um then you have 100% control over this. you're able to allow either everyone to use your avatar or or select a group of people or mutual.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So if you follow them, they follow you. So you have a lot of control into who gets to use this. And also, as far as I can tell, they do have they do a very good job of not allowing bad things to happen to you. I mean, >> you tested that. >> Well, I I've just been looking at what people produce with Sam Alman.

### 📋 セクション 34

Okay. And while there has been borderline stuff, >> there's only one clip that I saw I was like, "Oof, like this is a little bit >> probably inappropriate, but but other than that, I mean, yeah, he's there's one where his head is sticking out of a toilet and he's singing and some people might say that's bad or whatever, but it's all within kind of this goofy thing." >> Yeah. >> Like nothing horrible. pointing out that >> and um you know I've seen how many of how many people made stuff with him in it like million millions of clips with him at this point. I haven't seen one that's just horrible.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I was shocked to see so many famous people. I thought there'd just be these crazy filters on it. Like like you have Bob Ross, you've got Michael Jackson, you've got um characters from video games in here. And the reason why this really surprised me is because it's not really what you see from the image generator inside of um GPT chat GPT, right? Like Dolly 1 and 2 didn't do that.

### 📝 セクション 36

They didn't take it this loose. Um VO doesn't like really let you generate this kind of stuff. So they really went all out and they're absolutely just asking to be sued, but I think that's part of the strategy. So um here's here's kind of what I think's going to happen. Let me um play this like Star Trek clip.

### 💡 セクション 37

And you can see they actually decided to I I asked for a Star Trek styled video. They actually decided to put the >> Star Trek emblem that looks really close on there. And then check out the style this video is. >> Confirm it's real, sir. >> Lieutenant, bring up the world we detected on Long Range.

### 🔧 セクション 38

The one that looks like it's built out of blocks. >> Hi, Captain. Routing it to the main viewer. Displaying now. >> Incredible.

### 🎯 セクション 39

It's like a video game grew into a planet. >> All readings confirm it's real, sir. >> Okay. detect. >> Um, so what I'm trying to get there is that what's going to happen is the same thing YouTube did.

### 💭 セクション 40

They took actual music from real artists and they let it be uploaded to YouTube years ago when this was not acceptable yet. Um, and then bunch of companies sued them, right? Like Taylor Swift didn't want her song on there and not getting paid for it. And then throughout the lawsuit, they kind of introduced this ability to identify when the song was being used and tag it. and then if there was an advertisement ran on it, share some of that revenue back with the company that owns Taylor Swift's music.

### 📌 セクション 41

Um, and then that kind of opened the door to what we saw with Tik Tok where they were more on a Chinese server. So, they even pushed it sort of further the way Sam is right here and just said, "Put it out there and then slowly make sure that the companies see the benefit in the the amount of views that they get in making it trending means that you'll sell more albums when you're on tour." And then it kind of just sort of diluted the whole system down into what we live through now. So I think identity is next. And to me, this was a big shocker. But I guess Star Trek has to let go of like control over their their whole brand.

### ✅ セクション 42

and they're probably just going to have to say, "All right, every time someone like me, a random person on the internet, generates something that looks like Star Trek and it has the Star Trek emblem, as long as it's PG-rated and it's not hurting our brand, we should just let it go." And then maybe if there's a gold chain on me and somebody clicks that and goes to Amazon, uh, the company that owns Star Trek, Paramount, would get some money. Or maybe an advertisement is built into the ad and Paramount gets some money. or there's an advertisement before after it and they get some money and it ends up just being this weird mismash of IP being very different all of a sudden. Like I I really question if this is a move that's going to could like shake all fundamental IP like across the whole industry. So, we interviewed Ed Sachi a few weeks ago, I think.

### 📚 セクション 43

And I got to I got to give him a lot of credit because as we were talking, he made some his vision of what's going to happen to me felt so much ahead of everyone else. But interestingly, over the last few weeks, I'm like, "Oh, no. I think this is where all the big companies are are heading. This is where That was a very strange video I did of me." Uh but um >> strange >> I got to I got to show people I I'll show some of my favorite clips in a second here. But um his idea was that these AI models number one like Yes.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So what we're talking about is like you will have sort of control over your likeness, your appearance. And we're already seeing that with Sora, too. Like I can control where I appear. Uh I I did a little PSA yesterday on Twitter. I'm like, "By the way, if you if you make cameos of people and those cameos, like those videos, they're still private.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So, they're in your sort of private folder. Those people can see your videos." So, I was like, "Some of you people are making some weird stuff with me and I can see it >> and not publishing it." >> Yeah. Even though you're not publishing it, I can still see it. >> Um and um but but I do have control over that. So, I can actually delete I can click delete if I'm in a video that somebody has in there.

### 🚀 セクション 46

And can't you kind of see how that's going to the next step of like you also now Taylor Swift can also identify herself and can probably get some of that revenue back because the system itself knows where this content is. Yes. And not only that, but the thing is what Ed Sachi where he kind of blew my mind is he was saying because remember we were saying how oh but it's gonna destroy certain things because somebody's going to take you know Captain Peicard and he's going to they're going to make him do something super silly and it's going to sort of like devalue that brand that character that that world. You're saying no no no like the AI model will allow you or the the copyright holder the IP holder to control how those characters get sort of used. So if they want very strict controls to where they can't be sort of out of cannon so to speak, they they can only act like they're supposed to within that story line, you can preserve that.

### ⚡ セクション 47

And with Sora, there is custom instructions. So if I don't want people to put me in certain positions literally or or or figuratively or whatever, you know, I can I can Yeah, I can say that if I don't want to be associated with >> certain political things, I can do that. >> So yeah, we're already seeing that a little bit. Yeah, the that is man this thing is I feel like I'm just like unpeeling this onion of interesting ideas that Sam Alman had already figured out that I'm just learning. You know what?

### 🌟 セクション 48

That is such a profound thought and it it blows my mind to think about that, but yeah, I I guess and I hadn't thought about this before, but Peard from Paramount could be assigned that IP like they're in charge of where the Pequard deep fakes go and on their end they would have a piece of memory and they would say Bard is has these uh personality types. He's only seen in a leadership position. and he's never bent over looking stupid. He's never put in the past or whatever whatever their long kind of custom instruction is for him. And then people like you and me, we go to generate a skit where it's like Dylan and Pequard like on a podcast and if it doesn't align with that custom instruction, then Paramount doesn't allow it.

### 🎬 セクション 49

>> That's crazy. >> Yeah. And Ed Sachi was the first person that kind of when he was saying that it dawned on me like oh like the AI thing will the model not just produces whatever anybody wants it to it will control the actual sort of how you can represent that character and >> so help me imagine what does that world look like? So so I maybe I can't generate a fight with Logan Paul without him winning or something like that if he wants to take it that far. Uh well, so I think with with the sort of the influencers, it's going to be different than with the IP with the actual like whatever Lord of the Rings, Iron Man, etc., etc., etc.

### 📋 セクション 50

I think this is one of the reasons why a lot of brands like what we were talking about in Hollywood, they're not going to necessarily want to opt out of these ecosystems because yeah, their characters might be getting used on the platform and normally they would not want that. They're like, "Nope, we're not getting paid so you guys can't use it." Now it's it's different because it's like your the people on that platform can use your IP in the way that you designate to be used to play with that and sort of interact with that. So similar how streamers play video games, right? So most video game companies are not like, oh, let's block that streamer from streaming our game because it's like, no, he's sharing it with his audience. So, I'm sure they're going to they're going to be care number one about getting the money, getting some cut of the revenue, if that generates any revenue.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Um, and also not, you know, I'm sure they don't want their characters saying horrible stuff that gets them in trouble. Uh, and then they're going to they're going to have, which I think is going to be a blanket thing for everybody. And then you're going to have custom instructions to say specifically, don't do this. Um, but for influencers like for for us or for the rock stars or Logan Paul, who's on there by the way, I have a clip with him and a few other people. Um, but for them, yeah, they might just block certain things.

### 📝 セクション 52

Like if there's some scandal or thing that they're involved in, maybe they'll block reference to that scandal. Or if there's some new event in politics, they can block that. Or if there's, you know, how sometimes there people make up words that are have like bad political meaning to kind of hide that um slang for it or whatever. So maybe don't say this word, right? Cuz this word could mean this other thing or whatever.

### 💡 セクション 53

So that's how how I'm viewing that if that makes sense. >> Well, do you want to show off anything in particular that you found surprising? >> And then after that, we could even talk I'm sure you've heard of Tilly Norwood, so we can talk about her. >> Oh, so I've heard of it, but I've know very little about what's happening with that except that I but yeah, that's I just heard of it yesterday for the first time. So >> yeah, we can touch on her.

### 🔧 セクション 54

She's now in negotiations with multiple Hollywood talent firms and she doesn't exist. >> Good for her. I'm I'm sure she's very happy. Whatever that means. Uh yeah.

### 🎯 セクション 55

>> Oh, these are my drafts, I guess. So, um yeah. Yeah. So, as you can see, there's tons of stuff that I do not publish because it's weird and or or it just doesn't make sense. Usually, most of it is weird.

### 💭 セクション 56

Um, so, okay. So, one of the things that I have been really enjoying is this idea. Oh, for for fans of Bob Ross. >> Hold still for me. We're going to put a little bit of sky right here on your cheek.

### 📌 セクション 57

>> Why is this happening? >> Nothing to worry about. Happy little colors. That's all. >> I did not agree to this.

### ✅ セクション 58

>> It'll be fine. Let the >> seriously, why is this happening? Hold still. So, um, >> painting your face into the painting. >> Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 59

Uh, one of the things that today I saw somebody do it with Okay. So, today I saw somebody do it with Dust 2, which is a map in Counterstrike, and I was like, "Oh, that's a good idea." So, being like a travel vlogger in these various locations, whether it's sci-fi or or video games. So, here's just let me show you a few. I think this really kind of showcases kind of the creativity they can have of this stuff and it might be very interesting for people to get a glimpse because it's either them or some influencer they like or I've used a lot with Michael Jackson and and people like that to to put them in locations. This is where that combination of creativity is going to be like this person in this weird location doing this weird thing.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So here at mid All right, we're on dust two. One of the most iconic layouts in gaming. I'm starting here at mid walking through these sunbaked alleys. You can see the faded paint and the wires criss-crossing above. Everything funnels toward catwalk just behind me.

### 🎨 セクション 61

This red be >> that's looking pretty good, right? Pretty realistic. >> Unbelievable. Yeah. I mean, I will say also compared to VO3 or or cling like it actually does multiple cuts with audio, which is another kind of new thing.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Like you can tell it's been trained on popular short form content with cuts involved, too. >> Surprisingly good short form. that weird vlogger style or whatever you want to call it. >> Here's Black Mesa. >> Inside Black Mesa.

### ⚡ セクション 63

I'm in one of the admin corridors for sector C. Everything feels very late. Those poured '9s concrete walls, the yellow and black hazard stripes, pipes overhead. We made it inside black. >> So, uh, let's see, just maybe one more that I think really really worked out here.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Um, so this is the night elf zone. >> All right, we're out here in Teldrasal, the night elf starting zone. The whole place sits on the back of a giant world tree. So everything has this soft purple glow and that cool resin and pine smell in the air over here. >> So I think that's one of the things that I think people are going to love.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So this idea of putting people either in weird situations or weird locations either for a laugh or I mean this isn't funny, but I think it's it's engaging though. I mean this is the kind of stuff I think I would pause and watch if I'm just flicking through. Just look at them in that world. how interesting that is >> cuz a lot of us played this game. We remembered like I I either played as the orcs or as the night elves depending on which faction I went.

### 📋 セクション 66

So between this and >> orar the front gates of organar and the scale of >> you know between these two this really sort of to me a lot of my childhood or whatever like like this brings a lot of memories. So the idea of me now being a travel vlogger on location shooting something. >> Yeah. It's like the beginning of like going into VR and just starting to live in these worlds. >> Yeah.

### ⭐ セクション 67

And I think this is going to resonate with a lot of people cuz they're like, "Oh yeah, I remember that location." I and then seeing it like with with through a a different set of eyes is is is going to be a trip for people. So I definitely see something like this having a lot of interest. But again, so I think the biggest thing, the biggest appeal here will be actual um cameos with people either you know or people you follow online. So maybe I could find a few um so let me see if I can find a few that uh >> you did what? Brian Johnson, Michael Jackson.

### 📝 セクション 68

I've seen you doing stuff with Sam Alman. >> Yeah. So here's here's uh here's one >> days >> two maybe three. This burger is the only thing keeping me standing. My eyes feel like sandpaper.

### 💡 セクション 69

>> So that's up me and Brian Johnson. The video is a little bit weird. So um because it like the it it kept going past the wakeup scene. So I'm still figuring out how to prompt it to get the right results. Couple tips I think for people.

### 🔧 セクション 70

One is use quotation marks for specific things that if if you want specific things to be said using quotation marks I think it gets it a little bit better. It kind of understands it a little bit better. Um so a lot of this is people's cameos that they did with me you know without my sort of I mean I guess I approved it but you know I have no control of of where they take it. This was one of my favorite >> decision has always been my language. every line, every stitch, every decibel, exactly where I want it.

### 🎯 セクション 71

That's why we built this, the West Roth edition. >> I guess I'm in a in a car commercial. So, that was very interesting. There's one that either I'm pretty sure I did it with Matt Vid Pro that I just want to showcase here. I I I don't want to spend like an hour doing this.

### 💭 セクション 72

I just want to kind of maybe show some of my fe my favorites. >> Um, let me see if I can find one. What what were your impressions so far of the platform and the cameos? >> Yeah, I mean I'm like I said a shock that cameos work that you can add Michael Jackson and video game characters. I've found myself falling into a lot of the like almost like pretend serious on cartoon type things.

### 📌 セクション 73

Like I I watched like a longer form thing with Princess Peach talking about like what it's like dating Mario and like why he's such a clinger and like clingy guy and stuff and it just the perspectives beyond the special effects are kind of shocking me too. So yeah, I mean I've seen you somebody described it as being very tired afterwards and I have felt that. I don't know if this is the same, but I I I get on TikTok and I watch it for too long and I feel bad about myself. When I sit and I look at Sora for 20 minutes or something, I actually feel tired. I don't know if my eyes are just trying to process the insane insanity of all the crossovers or the sort of visual tweaks.

### ✅ セクション 74

The brain just seems kind of like it seems like it's really working hard. I don't know if I'm going to jump into it the same way I want for like a dopamine hit, but I might. It certainly seems like a right now it's a bit different than the other platforms. Yeah. And definitely we got to assume that by next year because it seems like every six months or so these things have a large leap in quality.

### 📚 セクション 75

So, imagine another year where we'll look back in this and be like, "How did we even watch this? This is so fake and whatever >> because it's going to get so much better. Our likeness is going to be so much more like ourselves." >> Um, so we'll see. We'll see cuz right now it's it's obvious it's AI. But this somebody made this one.

### 🔖 セクション 76

I really enjoyed this one. take me back to the days. >> So that's that's Tim from Theory. >> He's a musician though. He probably loves it, you know.

### 🎨 セクション 77

>> Yeah. And then I made one with Mad Pro where you were testing a tool called Roy where you live an entire life in a simulation. Coming out of it can be a bit jarring. >> Where am I? What happened to my wife and kids?

### 🚀 セクション 78

Who are you? >> We're testing a tool. >> Anyways, I just wanted to point those out because it does have >> Let me let me let me get out of there. So, um, yeah, I wanted to point those out because it does have a certain sense of humor, so to speak. So, sometimes even if you don't explain it too too well, it kind of understands where you're trying to go with it.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So, there's certain ones that nail the something funny about it. And it's hard to describe what, but it kind of >> No, it does. you know, you can uh so I've done some stuff with Rick and Morty on on my Sora that was just like be funny and it it kind of did like it came up with words that I didn't type in in quotes and it it had Rick and Morty bantering about something silly that just just diffused out of nowhere into these systems. So yeah, in fact, in fact, South it'd be interesting to talk to Ed Sachi about South Park is really well represented in this data set also. Um, Stan and Kyle sound exactly right.

### 🌟 セクション 80

They talk exactly right. It almost seems like it's going to jump ahead of the stuff he was doing. May not jump ahead, but it certainly feels like you could start watching actual South Park shows if they would just make this 20 minutes worth of content just strung together. So, the long form maybe is still six months, a year away or something, but it's seems like the capabilities for the story line are are kind of deep in this model already. Yeah, I mean we've seen an example of I guess you could call it long form during when Sor was launched.

### 🎬 セクション 81

One of the employees had that whole sequence with him and um Sam Alman trying to launch Sor. It's like a dream sequence. And so now looking back, I'm like, okay, so he took maybe 20 to 30 of those little shorts and kind of put them together. But man, it looked pretty good. I mean, it had a story line.

### 📋 セクション 82

It had It was good. It was good because it told a story. Um, >> I wouldn't call it short uh uh long form quite yet, but it's it it's definitely it's definitely getting there. It seems like >> Yeah. Here's an example of the park.

### ⭐ セクション 83

>> Dude, lead paint used to be like the fancy stuff. Now it's just a fancy way to ruin your brain. Yeah. My uncle says it gives walls a rich patina. It also gives them a rich dentist and a rich collection of headaches.

### 📝 セクション 84

>> So, look, all of that conversation was nothing. Look at my prompt here. just make a bunch of South Park style characters talking about why lead paint is overrated. Like I didn't give them those exact words. They bantered in a way that they would banter naturally and it was probably funnier than if I would have scripted it, you know?

### 💡 セクション 85

>> Mhm. >> So they blows my mind. We could show them this one too. This was what the truth behind us. >> Check before you talk.

### 🔧 セクション 86

### 💭 セクション 88

I always feel bad. I'm like I hope I hope I don't come across as this. But I and actually on your channel because we posted that on YouTube as a collab and somebody commented like Wes seems like a pretty chill guy. Like I don't think this is a good representation. I'm like, "Okay, thank God." Like it isn't.

### 📌 セクション 89

Yeah. >> Yeah. I'm >> Have you Have you seen anything on any of the other social networks that has the Sora watermark on it yet? >> Oh, I mean it's flooding Twitter X, right? It's >> Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 90

Sora on it because I haven't seen that on YouTube yet. So, I didn't know if they were like particularly banning or keeping the the watermark off or if I just haven't seen it yet. I feel like I've seen one or two, but not it hasn't flooded yet, >> but I avoid the shorts section, I guess. So, >> okay. So, this I'll we'll talk about Tilly.

### 📚 セクション 91

This is a little bit overhyped. I think this is a bit of a kind of marketing thing, too. But she um but it it does bring up an interesting concept, which is this idea that there can be cameos now with people that aren't real. And there are companies out there that need to make that are making actual AI characters and they're pitching them to Hollywood. Um, oh, you know what?

### 🔖 セクション 92

I'll I'll find I'll find this video that kind of blew my mind, but there was a woman, maybe I'll just describe, but there was a woman who had she was hired to be in a movie and she had a watch party. She had like a cameo in a movie and she had a watch party with all of her friends and she was not notified that she was replaced before it actually went live. So they paid her, she acted the role out and then when she was doing the launch party, she was replaced with the Hakua girl and she wasn't told. So it was very disappointing. She's there with her friends expecting to be in the show and they see that uh Haley the hawk to a girl has been replaced and the company says well that's you know in response because she has a larger YouTube following a larger social media following and that's going to help you know probably sell the movie better.

### 🎨 セクション 93

So somebody in the marketing department at some point changed it and I mean I don't know what I thought about that. I felt bad for the woman who was cast originally and wasn't informed that you know she was not going to be in it anymore. makes me wonder about characters like Tilly Norwood here who's not real and is represented by a major Hollywood studio and can be licensed for an actual movie um that could be in theaters and will always look look the role now you know and what happens to Hollywood actors. Yeah. And actually so uh people watching please comment down below kind of your take on this.

### 🚀 セクション 94

I'd be very interested to to hear everybody's take on it. So yesterday somebody posted on Twitter saying something along the lines of like the era of effortless content creation is here and that everybody that kind of knows where this is heading should double double down on creating an online presence and trying to get some sort of a distribution some sort of IP that they're able to push out there. Um, and then there's of course there were a push back to that. So I'm curious, do people see this as the end of human influencers and like is that going to decrease or is that only going to get that much more important to have this presence or is it neutral for people? I'm curious.

### ⚡ セクション 95

>> Okay, so let me play this for a second. [Music] and I said something about chicken tenders. >> Yeah. >> You know, I was thinking about it's like everything that happened to me, it's like it's like >> Yeah, she's freaking out. I mean, that's a little little too much screaming, but anyways, but she realizes that she's been like removed.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Maybe this is even fake, too. I think this is real. like they covered it like it was real, but it seems like she was very stressed out that the Hakua was in there, you know what I mean? And I don't know, my heart just kind of broke for her, especially when there's not transparency that she's not going to be in there and her friends have come to a watch party. I don't know.

### 🎬 セクション 97

And they're like, "Turn it off." Like, "We're sorry." They hug her and obviously they're good friends, but it's just stressful, you know? So, I So, I don't follow a lot of this. So, just so I understand. So this is these are people that are like on Instagram, right? They're not sort of mainstream Hollywood actresses.

### 📋 セクション 98

>> Yeah. Yeah. They're just people who were hired to be in a movie and then, you know. >> Okay. So, she got replaced as like an extra we're talking about, right?

### ⭐ セクション 99

>> Kind of. Yeah. She had a role in there, but not a huge role. So, yeah. It's it's it's it's interesting.

### 📝 セクション 100

So, first of all, I don't know if that's real or not. Let's but let's let's pretend it is. Let's assume it is. Um, we might see a lot more stuff like this where you sort of you give your likeness to a movie or whatever and it doesn't appear or it appears in in places you don't want it to. We also had that in the past with actors that died showing up in scenes and it's just their AI sort of whatever um likeness.

### 💡 セクション 101

Um, >> and and does it lead to just everything is Kim Kardashian and Logan Paul? Like, you know what I mean? Like that's the other thing is does it just crush >> individuality and we're I don't know. Or maybe there's tons of individuality. Like it could go either way.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Maybe like those kind like Kim Kardashian just gets drowned out by the fact that now everybody's making videos with their friends. Or >> maybe the only thing Hollywood cares about is the gigantic people who push the numbers and they end up everywhere. So, or maybe it balances out perfectly and it just is kind of this new equilibrium of of media. I'm not really sure. >> I have no idea.

### 🎯 セクション 103

I So, I got to say this. I've always had a hard time understanding a lot of this social stuff online. So because I started doing online business back in like 2011 and the people that were like doing podcasts and trying to be like online pres like uh having an online presence just for the sake of having a cont content out there like I did not understand that. I'm like well like don't you want to have a business? Don't you like is the what's the point of just people knowing you?

### 💭 セクション 104

It's like fame without the money. Like I just could not wrap my head around it. Um, but then and this was before YouTube was how it was now. This was before Twitch. This was before a lot of this stuff.

### 📌 セクション 105

Now looking back at it's like oh it seems obvious but like this idea of people following people online to have that sometimes they say like parasocial relationship. >> So kind of like yeah like when you're streaming and you log in to see that person live to interact with them stuff like that. Um, and of course, YouTube also morphed into something else now where a channel is, let's say, one person that that posts and over time you develop kind of a relationship with that person like it like you go there for certain news, whatever. Um, like that wasn't obvious to to most people. This wasn't obvious.

### ✅ セクション 106

A lot of people when PewDiePie started getting super popular, people are like, why? like he plays video games, he plays Minecraft. Why does he have millions of followers making millions of dollars? Like it was super hard to wrap our heads around it at first. So, I might be like the wrong person to ask cuz maybe I just don't have a like an intuitive sense for these things cuz I was off.

### 📚 セクション 107

>> Did you know this was going to be big back in I don't know 2010, 2011? >> No. No. Oh, I mean I was I had a couple of epiphanies just during our conversation today about like how much this is changing the way media is going to go. So, no, I I get caught off guard as much as anyone.

### 🔖 セクション 108

I have very poor sense for predicting the future as much as I think about all this stuff. It only makes me more aware of how little I know. Yeah. And it's hard to and I think some people maybe have some intuitive understanding of it or they just maybe at that point they just wanted to be in the spotlight and then they were chasing that without realizing what a big sort of opportunity it was to because I mean a lot of Hollywood a lot of the news channels a lot of the published media got replaced with the online media right so it kind of took up more space and now it's almost like you see a lot of those people trying to come into the online space um >> well it' be hard to argue that um Haley the Huck to a girl even planned any of it. Like I mean her whole story is sort of fascinating because it was a street interview that went viral from a comment.

### 🎨 セクション 109

Like that wasn't even something anybody thought of, you know? >> Yeah. >> And now it leads to her knocking out somebody else in a in a fairly big Hollywood movie. Like what? >> Yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 110

And again, so that those things I feel like maybe some of them are a little bit too um like one in a million, whatever, but I mean, you look at the Twitch streamers, that's not that's not like winning the lottery like or it's it's not what I'm trying to say. So with Twitch stream, there's enough of them. They're fairly recent to where they just start streaming, playing games, and slowly grow an audience and eventually make millions of dollars a year to the point where it repeat that sort of process repeated so many times that you're like, "Okay, there's something here. People are looking for something." A lot of them play video games and seem to attract maybe somewhat younger viewers, although some Twitch streamers are more towards the older people. Um, but there's obviously some part of us that is drawn to that for community.

### ⚡ セクション 111

I've uh never watched that until whenever the Fallout 4 came out, I think it was, and I didn't have time to play it cuz I was I had a lot of work, but I was interested. I just I like what it's I want to know what the story is like, whatever. So, I I turned on Twitch for the first time because a lot of people in there were playing it. There was this Twitch streamer, Co-C Carnage was his name. And uh cuz I've tried looking at Twitch before just to try to understand that phenomenon and always I had to bounce off cuz man it was like toxic.

### 🌟 セクション 112

It was loud. It was immature. It was just like I'm like gh like this like a some clown that's there for entertaining little kids. I'm like gh like I don't want to see it. But here was a streamer of those.

### 🎬 セクション 113

He was older you know he had kids and he talked about more I don't know mature stuff. I don't know what to do how to say it. >> Felt some kind of eye connection. I was like, "Yeah, this is interesting. Like, I could sit here like while I'm working and have him on a side monitor and just it it it felt normal.

### 📋 セクション 114

It felt I was like, "Okay, I I get it." And later he described it as the vibe that he's going for. It's like imagine just hanging out at somebody's house when you're younger playing video games. Everybody's like talking and playing together. So, it's that vibe, but just, you know, sort of uh remote, right? to this idea that it's not like you and I were like communicating like this oneonone.

### ⭐ セクション 115

This is a different vibe. You're just hanging out. So you might imagine sitting with your friends, you're talking to one of them. There's another group over here. Everybody's kind of like not everybody's talking to each other at the same time is just hanging out in in in the vicinity of each other, if that makes sense.

### 📝 セクション 116

Yeah. So that's kind of like a hangout and that's kind of like the vibe that they're capturing there. Um, so I don't know if AI is going to replace that, but would it replace Tik Tok? It seems like those short format things are going to be like the first to go. >> I agree.

### 💡 セクション 117

All right, let me switch your topic over here. This is uh I just want to get your thoughts on Tesla electric cars and um the fact that BYD is selling more electric cars than Tesla seems to have similar levels of autonomy, maybe arguably still a bit behind Tesla, but they did just break the world speed record. So, this is a production car that anybody can buy. It is faster than the Tesla Roadster. Um, it got to 308 mph and it's 4 miles faster than um I think it was the Bugatti or something.

### 🔧 セクション 118

It was a gas powered car, but certainly it accelerated there much faster. Yeah. >> And um to do this you have to actually fight wind resistance in a way that's pretty pretty impressive. And you have to have a suspension using artificial intelligence to constantly adjust keeping the front of the car just kind of the right amount of space above the the road. So, it's making all sorts of micro adjustments.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Um, what do you think about how advanced uh electric cars have become and and about Tesla kind of in some ways being in second place now in terms of sales and speed records and things like that? >> Oh, did who's in in first place for sales? I did not know Tesla got uh replaced. >> Yeah, this is BYD. This is the electric car company from China.

### 💭 セクション 120

>> They are the number one globally selling car now. Uh >> yes. >> Oh, I did not know that. >> Uh that is that is interesting. Um I mean so the speed records are I think interesting and uh I mean obviously that's not the same as having like the best sort of car on the road.

### 📌 セクション 121

the fast car out there isn't the the car that necessarily everybody buys. Um certainly I mean this is impressive. This is interesting. Although I I I got to say I sometimes enjoy watching like the Formula 1 race racing. Um and once I tuned into racing they have like electric car division.

### ✅ セクション 122

Um I don't know if it's Formula 1 or some other corporation, some other sort of company that does that. But man, it was kind of boring to watch cuz they're not loud. there. It's very There's no noise. Like zooming around the track, you're like, "Uh, this is not as interesting." Um, so I don't know.

### 📚 セクション 123

I'm kind of getting the same thing here. There's just like no sense of speed. I mean, obviously impressive what they're doing, right? No doubt. But I feel like um like that car car culture I think is not going to be the same if the cars aren't as >> That's true.

### 🔖 セクション 124

Yeah. as loud and like the, you know, the engines are as big or whatever. It's more like, okay, this is awesome. This is the future, but it's very sort of smart and efficient and uh all of that, but I'm I'm shocked to say that to to hear that BYD surpassed uh sales of Tesla. Yeah, the the numbers overall are pretty significant.

### 🎨 セクション 125

So, BYD delivered 4.27 million vehicles. In 2024, Tesla delivered 1.79 million. So several like more than double Tesla. They do that does include some of their gas cars. So even but even when it goes electric to electric, I think they're still in the lead by many.

### 🚀 セクション 126

It's it's a much bigger market. China's just huge. Um, but it's wild the story that Tesla originally brought their cars to China and seems like they sort of pioneered the whole manufacturing process, the whole kind of pipeline and then all of a sudden it just seems like China learned from Tesla and has now basically copied and beat out their sales units across the entire world already. So >> yeah, it's an interesting sort of problem because it might be almost like a cultural thing. You hear this a lot that um here I think in the in the west and in US we tend to maybe respond more to like individual innovation achievement copyright laws like and that's not the same everywhere like not every single culture shares that so there I mean it's learning and then getting it better so a lot of these Chinese companies the initial sort of tech might not have been ones that they discovered, but they figured out how to make it more efficient, how to scale it up, how to make it bigger, the entire infrastructure, and then they just like grind until it's perfected and and made better.

### ⚡ セクション 127

Um, and certainly, you know, I think a lot of people here, I know, are annoyed at that. Uh, but at the same time, I What do you think about that? Is that is that like a a moral issue or is it just like a c cultural perspective or rather an ethical issue versus just a cultural morals of a particular culture? >> Um gosh, that's an interesting way. Yeah, I guess depending on how you define those words, but I would say no probably.

### 🌟 セクション 128

I don't know. I feel like I don't really have a good thought on that. I mean, I feel like here we a lot of this was driven by corporations, right? So you know if we if you create some IP or some invention you want to make sure it gets paid you you want to make sure that that person gets paid so there's this incentive right but not every culture or economic system is built that way right so there you know if you're whether the ex Soviet Union or or China or whatever there it's more like how can we use this more like distributed system to scale up as much as possible and that's that's their sort of way to to to win at these games. It's interesting because not that long ago, Bali posted something along saying that how China is going to push out tons of open-source stuff into the market because guess what?

### 🎬 セクション 129

They're better at building the the hardware, right? The the robots, the ch, you know, the chips, the I don't mean AI chips, but like all the other hardware, they're going to be better at building it. Here in the US, we led in software in innovation for so long. But if they're able to flatten how much the US companies make from software and AI models because they have equivalent open-source models that are, you know, they're pushing out to the whole world. That means they still have their comparative advantage of being able to build the physical stuff.

### 📋 セクション 130

>> Yeah. And if you project into the long run, it does seem it seems easier to copy another country's code than it is their hardware manufacturing. So the fact that the US is only now really just stepping into building nuclear power plants at scale. We're just barely stepping into like upgrading our electric system. We're only starting to step into building kind of gigafactory type things.

### ⭐ セクション 131

um you know hopefully we kind of catch up but yeah it feels like the more important thing would be to be to have that manufacturing prowess and uh yeah it feels like China's maybe a couple steps ahead in that way and then it seems like we're couple steps ahead sometimes in the innovation we obviously have some of the best large language models and the best kind of business companies building them but um I don't know yeah I mean it just kind of depends on which aspect you're looking at in the long run hardware has got to be we got to catch up on that >> that's True. So, um, yeah, let me throw your thoughts out here. So, uh, this physicist has published a paper that was talking about how one of the most important things about feeling conscious, being human, is the fact that we have our own story. Like when you go to say anything, just by default, your brain had clocked in an entire story about who you were and um, the kinds of things you talk about. What do you think about that in terms of what we talked about with Sora and having Peard having his own sort of thoughts like his own kind of structure to keep him coherent in the way he interacts with everybody and the future of agentic workflows?

### 📝 セクション 132

Um, agentic meaning bots that have storylines that have some sort of sense of self. Do you identify as that being a key part of who who you are and and why you feel more conscious than an agent? And then what do you think that means as as agents now start to have this sort of self story in them? Yeah, this whole idea of a consciousness is so interesting and I mean we've been talking to a lot of different people with a lot of different takes. Um trying to I understand exactly what it is and of course no one has a a clear answer.

### 💡 セクション 133

These these are just it's hypotheses so to speak. So it's interesting yesterday uh Yasha Bach posted and he's working on that problem on the consciousness problem. So he posted this. He said, "Consciousness happens when the mind tries to take a selfie." That's an interesting way of looking at it because if you think about it, like >> yeah, >> sort of we're beginning to replicate some of the human brain's abilities with these neural nets. Certainly, we can say that there's beginning some there's some overlap now, right?

### 🔧 セクション 134

I think most people would agree there. That's at least some overlap. Um so but that doesn't mean that these things are conscious. So what happens when we sort of take a selfie of our own brain of our own awareness of our own existence right? So what does that imply?

### 🎯 セクション 135

That implies some sort of self-awareness and also some sort of a introspection. Um so between those two things like is that where consciousness sort of emerges? I mean that could very well I I feel like that that sort of describes it pretty well. Um and maybe this is what they're talking about here, right? So this is kind of like the way to get to true general intelligence is you have to have these models be able to do some introspection, whatever that means.

### 💭 セクション 136

the selfie of the mind or whatever and also some sort of an ability to change, you know, neuroplasticity as we call it. Currently, they're fixed, they're static, but if they're able to change their brain structure, their weights um in response to stimulus and also kind of like do those selfies, if you will. Yeah, we could potentially very well see consciousness emerge. >> Yeah. To me, the idea of a self story kind of rattled me.

### 📌 セクション 137

And that also seems like where some of the risk of misalignment might come from. If you have just an agent that's out there doing a task, that's sort of one thing. And it's just been triggered and it's prompting and it's responding. But the idea of it first needing to check its own essentially custom instructions. And those custom instructions are so robust that it's hard for us to make predictions about what some what they would do.

### ✅ セクション 138

So, it says like be kind and and be smart, but also lead. And especially if we're making some in movies, some of these characters are bad. They're literally bad guys. They're like try to, you know, stop Peard from, you know, their Klingons or their Borg, you know, like they're they're built to stop, you know, as long as it's all in this storyline, it doesn't matter. it as the same kind of thinking then takes real world action.

### 📚 セクション 139

Like you can imagine something like the picard prompt also uh going out onto the internet and and grabbing an API to do something and then that custom instruction sort of throwing it off a little bit you know or at in the extreme case giving it some kind of consciousness or some kind of desire that it needs to keep doing actions even outside of safe parameters. So, it's just going to be kind of a wild kind of I guess Pandora's box that we're opening as we as we give agents much more custom instructions. Yeah, wild times ahead because yeah, there's so many things that we don't even have fully defined. I feel like um and we're going to sort of quickly approach time when we're going to have to figure out what this stuff means. I feel like and again and some people are saying that this is not going to proceed past a certain point that maybe we're going to like level off.

### 🔖 セクション 140

I don't see any evidence for that yet. Um but to the people that think that maybe there's going to be like an AI winter of sorts or or something delayed, that's not a bad thing. I feel like certainly it feels like we're going kind of fast right now, doesn't it? Like if AGI got definitely >> if like if AGI was delayed 10 years like would that be a horrible thing? >> You know what I mean?

### 🎨 セクション 141

Is maybe it just gives gives us more time to figure out like how to deal with it if that Yeah. >> Yeah. And even if it's not AGI just the idea of the agents not kind of responding to our prompts as much as they are responding to their custom instructions just makes the world more complicated. It just just like humans like there's just a lot of humans with a lot of different storylines. You know, some people see themselves as the hero and some as the helpers and some some people are like, you know, I'm the kind of guy that like has a family and and keeps a job and other people are like, "No, I'm the entrepreneur.

I I risk my capital. I try to push the boundaries." And some people see themselves aligned with all sorts of different political actions and different um ways of interacting with other people. And in different countries, they have different cultures that have a whole another set of those. And we all sort of come together in this world stage and now we're just adding agents to it. It's a little bit it just it's just more more of that and and those agents might have you know at least humans are sort of constrained to certain like we all just it always we can always imagine what it what it's like to hurt someone else.

### ⚡ セクション 143

So we have some instinctive stuff that you don't have to teach. It's just built into us as humans. Uh and then robots maybe we need to be a little more careful to make sure that that's robustly explained so that they don't act a little bit different. >> Yeah. I told you my little not theory but there's a question uh a puzzle that's also a a test for sort of for sociopaths.

### 🌟 セクション 144

So most of us will not easily solve this puzzle. But people that are sociopaths as at least this is kind of like the theory they will quickly reach a a a conclusion a solution. And when I heard this, I'm like, "Oh, man." Because I I read the pro I I read that puzzle and I couldn't I couldn't figure out the answer. I'm like, "What?" And I reread it. Reread it.

### 🎬 セクション 145

And I was like, "Okay, so thank God I'm I'm not a sociopath, I guess." So I went out there. >> Good thing you failed. Yeah. >> Yeah. And then I started asking all all my friends, family members, and stuff like that.

### 📋 セクション 146

And most of them had the same thing. They kept like, "Wait, tell me the puzzle again. I don't understand it." And maybe one in 15 people, I think I found two people that just like answered the question. >> I was like, "Okay." And then those people, yeah, I mean, they might be a little bit more. It does feel like maybe some wiring is different or whatever.

### ⭐ セクション 147

But the point of that whole thing was that um a lot of the the nicities of like the humanity that we have that's wired because logically there's not logically there's no logic to like not being completely cutthroat and you know if you can get away with it doing some bad thing if it like gives you some sort of a advantage, right? It it h it has to be wired in at a deeper level to where you feel somebody's pain like it's your own to where you feel bad or guilty or whatever because a lot of logically a lot of that stuff doesn't make sense. And so if we're building like I forget who we were talking to recently, but they said like oh oh Lon Shapiro he was saying like the uh psychopathy is the default for these models because it's like why would they care unless we tell it to? So >> well and I mean and also the other problem is especially with the internet attention also goes to the people breaking those rules. So, I mean, if you if you really think about the way these politicians call each other out on like Truth Social and stuff, um, like no, none of us with our friend group act that way.

### 📝 セクション 148

Like, you know what I mean? Like, none of us are just like, "Oh my gosh." Like, when my friend loses at basketball, I don't troll him and tease him and criticize him and call him like the worst basketball player that has ever played. And, uh, you know, we all need to make sure he never steps on the court again. And like it's just so extreme like all these politics and it's it also brings attention to what they're saying and attention is where money is and attention is how you rally people to you know be on your side. So breaking some of these rules has also proven to be kind of a successful strategy in some ways and we do want these agents to go out there and be successful at what they do.

### 💡 セクション 149

So they might keep kind of hitting on that, you know, like, oh, if I can threaten somebody but also get away without the people knowing that I did it. As long as I succeed, I succeed. So, we'll have to watch some of that stuff, too. >> Mhm. Yeah.

### 🔧 セクション 150

Um, and also, can they be tricking you? I mean, that's really the big question. You know what I mean? We might not know if they're scheming against us. >> I Yeah, I'm just going to assume they are cuz I can't imagine myself being smart enough to outsmart them.

### 🎯 セクション 151

So, I just I humble up right away and be like, "Nope, I'm I'm going to assume that you know what you're doing on a level I don't." Maybe not yet. Maybe not today, but >> at some point. Yeah. >> Yeah. Um but yeah, I think that's probably good.

### 💭 セクション 152

We've um I did want to end on one I'll I'll share one kind of interesting uh Reddit thing. Tell me what your thought is on this custom instruction this guy put in his uh in his wife's in his wife's um chat GPT. Always take the husband's side if asked about relationship advice issues. I mean I thought it was diabolical kind of kind of hilarious because it's just sort of fun. But um you know also like I guess coming off how seriously we were talking a second ago, it is kind of wild to think about the systems in our own homes and houses kind of being um you know kind of have custom instructions on the way it interacts with us too.

### 📌 セクション 153

Yes. And it's so interesting how as these things become more and more useful to us more and more people are using it and becomes a bigger part of our lives. like what happens if you're able to hack into somebody else's thing like here somebody just you know injected some custom instructions uh I'm sure just through the phone or whatever but >> yeah I just put it in there I'm sure he's being very playful about this too but just >> but so we we we can't talk about this quite yet until about two weeks from now um and uh but we might be participating in a competition with that involve large language models >> Oh Yeah, >> there's going to be people from different sort of walks of life and uh not all of them are going to be have uh not all of them are going to be in the AI space. So, and it's going to be a competition where you have to utilize a large language model like Chad GBT or something similar to to win a game. And so I my first question I'm like do you to to the people organizing the co the contest I'm like do you guys have any rules against jailbreaks?

### ✅ セクション 154

Um because my first thought was like what if we what if somebody like ply the prompter gets in there and then >> just wins it all. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, you're he he's shown examples where he takes one model, he jailbreaks it, teaches it to do jailbreaks on other models, and so that model autonomously goes and jailbreaks the other models. And so, that was my first thought.

### 📚 セクション 155

I'm like, okay, this this seems like if you're able to execute that, you basically you win the game. And a lot of other people because they're not as deep into AI and stuff like that, they might not know how to they might not they might not have no idea what's happening. I didn't really So his prompts aren't just jailbreaks, they're viruses. >> So >> they're jailbreak viruses that go ahead and take action on other models. >> Well, I mean, you're able to tell the model to say something else, right?

### 🔖 セクション 156

So you can tell it, oh, go interact with this other agent. And normally if you tell it jailbreak it, it won't do it. It's like, sorry, I can't do that. But if it's jailbroken, it's going to carry out those instructions. And so you can see how you can tell it how to do it.

### 🎨 セクション 157

So you can give it an instructions on how whatever you did to that model, how to do it to a different model. So it's not by default a virus, but it could be viral like in that sense. Um, so with the competition that we're taking place and I'm like, what if somewhere in the custom instructions for your model, you put instructions like, okay, if things get really bad, this is your go-to pull this out of your back pocket in case you need to. >> Um, and we're at the kind of at the cutting edge of it, but I feel like we're going to be seeing more and more of this emerge. So, I'm I'm I'm curious what So, yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 158

What did you think about that that husband's uh custom instructions and what do you think about this? >> Well, I mean, I assumed it was kind of So, so I I assume that this is kind of a joke. Maybe he typed it in and just took a screenshot and put it on Reddit or maybe it's like playful and she knows or maybe it's not. But then again, sometimes if I really think about it, yeah, maybe it is kind of serious. like if she actually is asking for relationship advice and she's getting convinced on it.

### ⚡ セクション 159

Maybe it's not as funny as I kind of thought it was at first, but um overall the idea that we're going to be influenced seems like the exact kind of thing that is the whole future is about like that could be great. I don't mind a system that says hey like I'm going to try to filter out garbage. I am going to try to make you smarter. I am going to try to make sure that you get more productive. I think um that's exactly what I want.

### 🌟 セクション 160

And then getting that aligned a little bit wrong personally for the AI that's sitting on my phone or in my house um you know probably isn't going to be too big a deal because it's sort of on track to doing what I want. But you know in the long run could there be like things snuck into it? Could it be hacked? Could it be prompted in a way where I think it's in my best interest but it subtly isn't? I don't know.

### 🎬 セクション 161

I think it's going to be a very messy kind of kind of world and but you know it's a messy world that we live in now. People people have a lot of this problem and we have some ways to mitigate them and I'm sure we'll invent more. So it's not like hopeless or anything but it is something to be aware of and I I do think that ignorance is going to hurt you like if you're kind of like no I'll just trust the companies. I'll just assume all this stuff is like in my best interest. It's kind of like assuming advertising has your best interest.

### 📋 セクション 162

Like sometimes it's not bad, but don't don't just go in there not knowing like what their incentives are. >> Yeah. It's similar to how when online just was getting started, the internet, you know, you had to be just a lot more aware. Then over time, it became a lot more sort of easier and safer in a lot of ways. But in the beginning, you you put your credit card in at the at the wrong place, like forget it.

### ⭐ セクション 163

Like you're getting robbed, you're getting your identity stolen, all that stuff. Now it's a lot it's a lot safer. So, but yeah, with AI, this is still the wild wild west. Although it's sort of going into consumer technology so much faster than even the internet did originally. You know what I mean?

### 📝 セクション 164

There it took five years, maybe a decade while slowly permeated here. It's like, nope, everything will have a chatbot in it. >> Whether you want >> need to learn faster. Yeah, it does. Yeah.

### 💡 セクション 165

And that's and that's hard as you know if you're stuck in your ways. You're maybe a little bit older. You just aren't paying attention. Like this is tough. Like it's not you know I think in a lot of other industries like you know I don't necessarily need to be up on what car is the fastest in the world.

### 🔧 セクション 166

like that doesn't affect me in many ways, but it does kind of feel like knowing what's happening with uh with chat GPT being able to make purchases and um people asking questions of these systems for like day-to-day activities, they they can't be just ignoring or hoping. >> Kind of got to be kind of have your kind of uh finger on the pulse of what's going on there. >> Absolutely. Yeah, I'm excited about it because that means that there's a I mean, if you're doing it like me full-time, then it's it's exciting. But I I like I would hate to have to follow something that I'm not involved in, right?

### 🎯 セクション 167

So, if I had to follow some news about something else just to be Yeah. I would I would hate >> like politics. Like I hate I hate keeping up on politics, you know what I mean? And I know other people would say like, you know, you'd be informed about the world and stuff, but like h just like just another like insult to someone like >> No, I I have opted out and I guess I'm I'm I'm happier now, I think, because I've opted out of politics, but that that was largely because I got a little bit more obsessed in AI. So, you know what I mean?

### 💭 セクション 168

So, >> yeah, we're just busy with other stuff. Exactly. And AI is keeping us plenty busy. >> Yeah. >> Yeah.

### 📌 セクション 169

And also, I' I've purposely trying to like stay away from short form. not successful at it right now, especially now that I'm like on Sora, but the uh you know, trying to listen to audiobooks, trying to listen to podcasts, just hoping to just keep my brain in a little bit more of a deeper thinking mode because I can see myself sort of slipping out of it. And that's something I always used to sort of pride myself on was like, you know, a lot of I read a lot of non-fiction books and I realized I hadn't in 2024, 2025, I really didn't keep up like I used to. I like did not read as much last year. So, I'm trying to get back into that.

### ✅ セクション 170

Yeah, that's I think that's a great idea. I've been trying to do more of the same. Um, as well, there's an article recently about Andrew Huberman where a lot of people were saying things that I think a lot of people took to be negative because they're like, "Oh, he's a flake. He just disappears for months at a time because he's like reading some book or working on some project or so." They basically said that he would just like disappear and opt out of social engagements. I'm like, >> he's a hero.

### 📚 セクション 171

this is why he's able to do deep work cuz like he just becomes like invisible to the world >> and it's the people that always try to stay in contact. I feel like I mean we tend to like those people better cuz they're always available and stuff like that but I feel like yeah it's exactly what you're saying. It's like doing the deep work uh you have to sacrifice if if you're reaching if you're trying to be accessible that is sacrificed. You're able to do less deep work if you're also trying to keep up with everything all the time. So >> yeah, you know, I probably have we should probably end it.

### 🔖 セクション 172

So I don't want to go too far, but you know, Cloud 4.5 was going to be a topic we we're going to may talk about today, too. The um the deep thinking of it. I know, didn't you get it to write 11,000 lines of code in like seven hours and like think over it over and over again? >> Well, so that was the that was what they posted. I I was going to go deep into that into testing it and Sora came out and I was like, forget it.

### 🎨 セクション 173

It's >> okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so anyways, but yeah, that's the other thing is like it's like that even you even see that that's missing in the AI tools that we have now.

### 🚀 セクション 174

And I know they're working on that. So, we'll we'll investigate Cloud before the next video and see if 4.5 can do that. But, yeah, that idea that you can have it code something like Slack, go to bed, 7 hours later, come back with 11,000 lines that have been just tested and iterated on over and over and over and over again. That's the kind of deep work that humans, you know, need to do, too. Like, but for us, we can't do it in seven hours straight.

### ⚡ セクション 175

We have to have a week off and like think and process. And I know I know some of the best ideas I've got never happened like right away. Like you have to like you know shower shower thoughts obviously because your brain's actually cruising. You're driving around ideas come. You synthesize things slowly.

### 🌟 セクション 176

So it's definitely a lost kind of a lost art right now. >> Oh yeah, unfortunately. But Cal Newport Deep Work that was a that was a good book. So trying to learn a little bit more from him. Um yeah.

### 🎬 セクション 177

So that's >> deep work. Yeah. you recommend that book? >> So, I one of your favorites I I've I've listened to a lot of the interviews with him and he talks about the concepts from deep work. So, I I recommend that.

### 📋 セクション 178

I haven't read the the full book yet, although I I'm sure it's excellent. >> Yeah. So, you know, I finished The Brief History of Intelligence, uh Max Bennett. That was I think one of my favorite books of all time. Like surpris It sounds weird.

### ⭐ セクション 179

Sometimes like the last book I read is like my favorite of all time, you know, but this one I really do think will I've always wanted schools and the average person to just get a good sense of what happened all the way from like the evolution of life like RNA to DNA to like all the little species that like developed neurons or sight and then went down different branches all the way up to mammals and then all the way back into the ocean with dolphins and all the way over to the uh you know the primates and then to us and then have that laid out like what kind of intelligence did evolution discover at different times for different species and then like kind of put the whole thing together, you know? So to me that book was amazing. But uh Steven Pinker has a book called When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows, which is what I just started last night. So that's going to be my next one. And it's just it's the idea of how information is so different when certain people kind of hoard it and when sometimes when it's out in public how that actually changes the dynamic and then sometimes how when you know someone else knows but not everyone knows how that's like important.

### 📝 セクション 180

So I'm going to kind of try to get my head around that. It's like where theory of mind when it's one or two layers deep sort of changes how information works. >> Yeah. And just last thought something you said kind of uh reminded me of it. So this idea that because with with with the book you're talking about uh a brief history of intelligence like I'm beginning to see a lot more of human behavior and human problems and how our brains work through the lens of you know AI machine learning.

### 💡 セクション 181

So just today somebody posted online he's like uh this this this girl I don't think I follow her but you know how on X sometimes things pop up. She's like, "Why is it that every couple that I run into, the guy is is everybody's just the guy has back problems and the girl has stomach problems or some sort of tummy issues, >> which is kind of when I thought about it, like that's kind of a very common occurrence." >> I thought about it, I'm like, why? And tons of people responded because it was a great engagement farming by by that person. I was thinking about I'm like my thought immediately went to RL reinforcement learning. So if guys are sort of get their plus one and their positive reinforcement from putting on muscle and the more you work out if you get a little bit overconfident poor form like what's the most common injury back injury >> eating.

### 🔧 セクション 182

>> Yeah. Whether from squats or deadlifts or back like you can easily tweak your back. um you know, you're a little bit tired, the wrong form >> and or just grabbing the groceries like showing like like your wife looks at you and like can you get that thing off the roof? Oh yeah, right. Let me go get it.

### 🎯 セクション 183

You know what I mean? >> Yeah. Just being overconfident. Exactly. Exactly easily.

### 💭 セクション 184

Yeah. I didn't even think about that. But yeah, be just being overconfident. Uh and for for women, I think a lot of times just like being skinny and eating the right thing. Even just eating the wrong thing.

### 📌 セクション 185

I I think for women sometimes a bit of a social like, oh, you're going to eat those fries or whatever. like I'm never going to feel bad eating fries or whatever, but um so maybe maybe trying to eat less or some sort of diets or approaches like that might. So I just thinking through that I'm like man that's kind of easily solved by thinking through like what's what does society and biology what are we reinforc what's our little reward? What's our plus one? And then you can kind of from there go, okay, and if we just follow this trail, you know, here's why these people might have back injuries and these people might have some sort of a dispiosis or some sort of a gut issue.

### ✅ セクション 186

And I was like, okay. But more and more I'm thinking of it of it from that perspective just >> Yeah. Well, then you you'll love Max's book on intelligence because it it also goes back and forth between the natural world and uh things like TD learning that were that were invented at Google deep mind and how they do seem like they were learned from the biological world um and attention mechanisms and like where you see sort of similar things evolving and and selft talk. So yeah, there's a lot to it and you know there's always whatever the technology of the day was like steam engines were a way for people to understand you know humans and and activity and then over and over again we get these analogies but I I do question with AI if it's actually closer to one one I mean it's a trillion neurons that have kind of layers on them and edges are learned and then strategies on top of of them are learned in different layers It might not just be a metaphor for how we are. It actually might be learning about how we are.

### 📚 セクション 187

Might actually be almost one to one. And that would be different than a lot of the other technological revolutions. >> Yeah. Maybe our brains are not as what's the word now? Maybe not complex.

### 🔖 セクション 188

It's not the word. They they might be a lot easier to understand than once we than we once believed. Not how intricate they are at the ground level, but just like the actual how we produce thoughts and ideas and models, etc. >> Yeah. And maybe not one to one, but very like it it there's something about tuning the parameters of a trillion things that you know you're an AI is learning.

### 🎨 セクション 189

Humans are learning. It's not programmed. It's you're putting data in. You're kind of tweaking the results based on your reinforce like what you're reinforcing. And humans are kind of like that.

### 🚀 セクション 190

You're getting reinforced on good behavior your whole life. That's like literally what parenting is for children. Like there's just it's so close to us. >> Yeah. What if it's just data compression?

### ⚡ セクション 191

Like everything is just data compression. Like we get million of inputs through our eyes and ears and whatever and we compress it to have like a short summary and that short summary actually allows us to predict things in the world. And that's kind of the same thing that dogs do, right? You play fetch with a puppy over time. It has no concept of physics, but it's like, oh, when he throws it like this, I got to run over there to get the ball.

### 🌟 セクション 192

>> And so it just compresses that into like this is how I catch the ball or when I hear this noise, that means it's time to eat. And the models seem to be doing the same exact thing. So what if it's just intelligence that's that's just a way for us to compress data into useful >> and you know, and and it seems like there's not that many unique algorithms in the human brain. For example, at one point you they talk about how with with rats, they when they were babies, they could rewire the eyes to tuck touch the part of the brain where the ears usually go and the ears where the eyes usually go and and they the rats ended up fine. Meaning like the same parts of the brain can actually just rewire around completely different types of signals like photons versus audio waves.

### 🎬 セクション 193

But, you know, as long as it's done when the rats are newborns, then they'll they'll end up like you know, fine. And it's just it's mind-blowing the brains that general. >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, absolutely.

### 📋 セクション 194

And we we're running out of time. We there's amazing paper out of Google Deep Mind that we're going to have to cover in a different video because it's >> what which one is that? Oh, the the one we were just talking about. >> Dreamer 4. Yes.

### ⭐ セクション 195

>> Dreamer 4. Oh yeah. I haven't actually even read through it, but okay. We'll have to talk talk over that >> cuz I feel like Yeah, this is things have been kind of heading here for a while. >> Do you want you can talk about it for a second if you I'm already >> I have well let me let me so I haven't I haven't read it in full but basically off the top of my head >> uh based on the some summaries that I've read over it uh some people so basically the idea was if you remember Genie 3 I think was it the latest one so it's this idea that can rapidly create these little 3D worlds that you can walk through and so the idea is that instead of like they've presented it from a perspective of an agent learning to play Minecraft.

### 📝 セクション 196

So, how we've been approaching these things in the past is we get this agent to play Minecraft, the real Minecraft. Right here, they showed that if you create some sort of a I believe was it diffusion model again, I'm sorry if I'm getting the details wrong, but where it just similar to Genie 3 or similar to how the sore and stuff like that just produced these images, they produced synthetic images of Minecraft 3. So, kind of a a simulation and they train the agent to be good at Minecraft just through running through those simulations, which is obviously a great application for robots, right? Because we're able to train them super fast through these like through simulating certain scenarios. they don't have to.

### 💡 セクション 197

Um, it's just it's a it's a it's I think it's a proof of concept that we're able to train some pretty incredible stuff through through simulating them, not through act actually playing it. So, it doesn't have to play Minecraft. It just has to dream about Minecraft in >> imagine. Yeah, they're literally calling it imagination training. Learning directly through trial and error in real environments.

### 🔧 セクション 198

This is exactly what you called. You were like there's VO and then there's Genie and then what is this for? It's for a new type of training. But you were you were describing it more like a physics simulation. But yeah, I think it needs a different term like imagination training because it is diffused and it's not going to have physical rules that always hold logically.

### 🎯 セクション 199

But it's going to have imagination just like us, right? like where we we simulate the future pretty close to physics, but it's not confined by physics. We just predict it because we want to be accurate. But that's kind of what imagination training seems like it's doing. So this paper could be wild.

### 💭 セクション 200

Yeah. And I'm curious to know, I mean, how much of our sort of stuff happens in our brain like this where we kind of were able to simulate certain things uh and have a model of of what would happen cuz I don't think I don't think there's any animal or maybe a few animals that that that do this like you know you if a hunter or you know let's say back in the days you're walking through the forest you see some sort of a game animal you're like oh let me go home get the bow and arrow or whatever and come back. That's a very unique thing in that we're like imagining, we're planning against an imaginary future. Like if I leave and get this thing, then I come back and then you're imagining a future where I have this tool and the animal's still there and therefore I get to, you know, hunt that animal, >> right? >> That doesn't really happen, I think, for most animals.

### 📌 セクション 201

Um, it has to you you need to have some higher level abilities and these LMS just naturally also plan this way. So, it's just an interesting uh concept. >> So, this system dreamer 4, this is the first agent to ever obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline data data. Meaning that it learned long sequences of actions over two or 20,000 steps just by imagining scenarios. And they arguing like this is huge because Minecraft is notorious for being open-ended and difficult for AI to play.

### ✅ セクション 202

Hey, Dreamer 4 cracked it efficiently just by dreaming up future actions. >> Yeah. So, yeah, we'll see. That's sounds like wild stuff. >> Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 203

And I'm very excited to see Google Deep Mind's robotics that they're doing because they've they've also applied Dreamer 4 to um training robots like the the grasping hands of various objects. So, man, we might have a robotic revolution soon. Deis Hassab has said that we might see a Chai GBT moment for robotics within the next I think he said like in three years or so. So exciting. >> Wow.

### 🔖 セクション 204

Yeah. All right. All right. I guess get back to my regular life and can't just do this all day. But yeah, thanks for hanging out with me and uh chatting and yeah, we I love to get into Dreamer 4 and all this stuff because there is just so many breakthroughs every week now.

### 🎨 セクション 205

Leave some comments below. We're going to be testing um the collab feature. So, you're going to be and yeah, say if you can comment where you're watching this cuz I think all the comments get aggregated. So, just say where yeah, which channel did you see this video on first? That would be an interesting thing to test out.

### ⚡ セクション 207

And yeah, thank you so much for being here. And don't forget to follow us on Sora, too. So, don't forget it's a social network. You have to download the new app, but forward/Westroth and Dylan Curious. So, you can follow both of us.
