## 💡 概要

この動画では、OpenAIがスタートアップを組織的に破壊する戦略について詳しく解説しています。OpenAIは自社のAPIを通じて他社が構築したサービスを観察し、最も成長が速いスタートアップの機能を自社プラットフォームに取り込むという手法を採用しています。Apps SDK、Agent Kit、ChatKitなどの発表により、OpenAIは単なるAI企業からエコシステム全体を支配する「Everything App」へと進化しようとしています。この動画は起業家やAI関連のビジネスを検討している人向けの重要な警告と戦略ガイドです。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **OpenAIの評価額5000億ドル**: SpaceXを超え、世界で最も価値のあるスタートアップに
- **週間8億人のアクティブユーザー**: ChatGPTの圧倒的な市場支配力
- **戦略的な競合排除**: OpenAI APIで最も成功したサービスを自社機能として取り込む
- **Agent Kitを6週間で開発**: Codexを活用して通常5年かかるプロジェクトをわずか6週間で完成
- **AIツール使用の必須性**: Codexのようなツールを使わなければ競争に勝てない時代に突入

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Your favorite nonprofit is becoming a monopoly. OpenAI is now worth $500 billion. They just signed deals with Nvidia, Oracle, and AMD. They're consuming more energy than a small country, and they replaced your startup before you even start it. And they're going to do it with the Chad GBD ecosystem.

### 📋 背景・概要

See, OpenI plans to build Chat GBD into the Everything app, making sure that us, the users, never leave the comforts of the chat. During their recent dev day, they announced apps SDK. This allows Chad GBD to use any app or website on the internet. So, they're not just trying to become the next browser. They want Chad GBD to be the next operating system.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Oh, and they also released agent kit, which is a brand new way of building AI agents. It's basically their own version of NA10. Yeah, OpenAI is showing total domination. CHGBT recently reached 800 million weekly active users. Also, their recent 500 billion valuation puts them ahead of SpaceX, making OpenAI the most valuable startup in the world.

### 📝 詳細説明

And now they want to take over the entire internet. This is the map of all of the companies that OpenAI is working with. It feels like every month they're signing a new multiund billion deal and this is what's making them unstoppable. So, OpenAI has a ruthless strategy that not enough people are talking about and this is how they replace startups and how they choose which startups to replace. They make their AI models available through their OpenAI API and then they watch carefully what others build, what features, what products, what services you create powered by their own AI models.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And then, and this is the ruthless part, they attack and replace the startups with the most revenue growth. the startups that reach product market fit and have the fastest growth. That's where OpenAI comes in and they build their own version of the same product or service. And the man behind the strategy is of course Sam Alman, the CEO of OpenAI. Now, love him or hate him, Sam Olman is one of the greatest entrepreneurs of this generation.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Nobody can dispute that. He's the CEO of a 500 billion company. He's front running a entire technological revolution, probably the biggest technology shift in the history of humanity. And he's doing all of that while being just 40 years old. And it's not like there's no competition.

### 🎯 応用例

He's competing with some of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page. These are some of the most successful and most powerful people in the world. Yet Sam still seems to be winning. So here's the plan.

### 💭 考察

I'll show you how people like me and you can actually benefit from this OpenAI takeover thanks to the apps SDK. We'll also look at how to build a agents with the new agent kit because this is a completely new era as well as how it compares to NA10 make.com and Zapier. And and this is my favorite part will break down how OpenAI was able to ship a multi-year project, a project that would take other companies five plus years in just 6 weeks thanks to their new codec. So, first here is Sam introducing the apps SDK. >> Today we're launching the apps SDK.

### 📌 まとめ

With the apps SDK, you get the full stack. You can connect your data, trigger actions, render a fully interactive UI, and more. When you build with the apps SDK, your apps can reach hundreds of millions of ChatGBT users. Basically, Chad GBT is becoming an app store. The apps SDK clearly shows us how OpenAI plans to take over the internet.

### ✅ 結論

Their goal is for the average person, the typical user to do everything from ChaiBT. So, you won't go to booking.com to book your hotel. You'll do it by asking CHBT. And that way, you never leave the website. Now, this can either make or break your business depending on what strategy you take.

### 📚 追加情報

>> When someone's using chatbt, you'll be able to find an app by asking for it by name. For example, you could sketch out a product flow for chatbt and then say, "Figma, turn the sketch into a workable diagram. We're also making apps discoverable right in the conversation. When a user asks for something, we can surface a relevant app as a recommendation." >> Now, let's look at the bright side because maybe the move isn't to fight OpenAI. Maybe the move is to join them and benefit from their rise.

### 🔖 補足

So all of us that have a product or website, we can take the product and using the app's SDK build a CH GBT native app. This will allow you to tap the 800 plus million weekly active users who can now discover your business right from CH GBT. But apps SDK is just the beginning because OpenAI also released agent kit. >> Agent Kit is a complete set of building blocks available in the OpenAI platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agentic workflows.

### 🎨 セクション 13

>> Here is the craziest part. Agent Kit was built in 6 weeks. That's right. This entire platform that allows you to build and deploy AI agents was developed in just 6 weeks. This is the power of AI.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And as Signal says here, this is truly ridiculous. If you're a startup, you might think, okay, I'm not going to play the same game or I'm going to work 96 127. But the truth is you will never outship AI. If you refuse to use AI tools like Codex, you will simply lose. That is the cold hard truth.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And OpenAI just walk the walk. They just demonstrated how fast you can move thanks to AI agents like Codex, which by the way also got major updates, which we'll cover in a bit. Now, that fact that they shipped it in just 6 weeks, becomes that much crazier when you realize that agent kit involves another tool named chatkit. The second thing is chatkit. We're making it easy to bring great chat experiences right into your own apps.

### 🌟 セクション 16

You get a simple embeddible chat interface that you can make your own. You can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique. And you can see in the video here how chat can work across each agent node and call on tools to form the best response. So the way to understand chatkit is that you can now have CHIGBT in your site. So if you don't want to take the strategy of building a app with apps SDK and putting that into CHBT, you can still benefit from CIGBD by embedding it into your site.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So chatkit gives you a readymade chat interface. You can customize and add into your website or your app. So just look at some of these examples on the right. These are called widgets and you can have these directly in the chat interface. So these can be outputed and interacted by CH GBD.

### 📋 セクション 18

So it's not just pure text and it's very clear that OpenAI is trying to move away from just being text right like large language models next token prediction these are paradigms that are inherently limiting text is great it's better than nothing but it's the biggest issue with all of this chat user interface right just having text we need another modality whether it's images audio voice video or these custom UI elements also known as widgets so let's look at how OpenAI was able to do all of this in just 6 weeks And that is thanks to Codex. >> Earlier this year, we launched a research preview of Codeex. It works everywhere you code. Now, your chat GBT account connects everything so you can move your work seamlessly between your tools. We've released a ton of new features for Codeex and it now runs on the new GPT5 codeex model, a version of GPT5 purposely trained for codeex and Aenta coding.

### ⭐ セクション 19

This model is better at tasks like code refactoring and code review and it can dynamically adjust its thinking time for the complexity of the task. a new codeex SDK so that you can extend and automate codecs in your team's own workflows. >> So I know a lot of softwares are are claiming to be the cloth code killer but Codex is the only one that actually has any validity to this statement. So if you don't know Codex is OpenAI's coding agent and it got upgraded yet again. Now I would say it was already the best because I use it more than CL code and I trust it way more than Cloud Code at the moment.

### 📝 セクション 20

But now it got another major upgrade and that's because OpenAI released Codex SDK and this allows me and you to see inside the agent framework. So unlike Enthropic which they're refusing to make cloud code open source, OpenAI just made Codex completely open source. So we can look inside, we can see the prompting techniques, the agent orchestration and what it takes to build a powerful coding agent like Codex. So basically now Codex can do everything from pull request reviews to long running refactors literally multiple hours to working on 20 plus tasks asynchronously in the cloud. It really is the ultimate coding AI agent.

### 💡 セクション 21

But first of all, if we go back to our app right here, let's see if we can actually control this camera now with this Xbox controller. There we go. It works. That's pretty awesome. What's funny is like I didn't even specify to Codex which button should do what, but it figured that the joystick was probably a good idea.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So that's that's actually perfect. >> Now we have to address something uncomfortable because during the live stream, OpenI tried very hard to hide the most obvious takeaway and that is all of these improvements and advancements have a real cost to the people who do not adapt, the people who don't pay attention, right? Not everybody watches videos like this one. Not everybody is paying attention to the latest AI advancements. And the truth is is that those people their jobs will be replaced.

### 🎯 セクション 23

You could see it throughout this presentation if you actually paid attention in multiple different roles. Camera operators, the light technicians, translators, radiologists, teachers, real estate agents, tour guides. I mean they literally showed how they would replace all the tour guides in Versailles in Paris. All of those jobs will be done better with AI. Now obviously open will never say this but anybody who spends 5 seconds thinking about it will realize that we only have two choices.

### 💭 セクション 24

Either adapt or get replaced. Now to make you even more uncomfortable there's going to be a complete divide of how AI impacts you. People with high IQ will become superhuman. You'll be able to automate all the repetitive with AI agents and you'll be able to build stuff, build custom software 50 times faster than you could otherwise. However, people with less than average IQ will become likely addicted to AI generated content.

### 📌 セクション 25

Obviously, not all of them, but in general, the masses will be deceived by AI videos, AI images, AI voices, and they'll fall into AI powered propaganda. And the unfortunate and uncomfortable truth is that God or the universe, whatever you believe, has decided your destiny a long time ago because you cannot really choose which of these categories you're in. So, in a way, your destiny has already been decided. This brings up the topic of the slob machine, right? The release of SAR 2, which is like what, two weeks ago?

### ✅ セクション 26

It's crazy. AI is moving so fast. Feels like forever ago. But yeah, SA 2 just released as well. And it took the realism of AI videos to the next level, right?

### 📚 セクション 27

Literally, some of them you cannot even tell. And now after the dev day, SAR 2 is available in the API, right? Right? So what that means is that people can build on top of this video model which means we will see even more AI slope. Now like it or not this is probably what the future of entertainment is going to look like.

### 🔖 セクション 28

It's going to be AI generated videos that are highly stimulating to the brain. And you might think okay I'm just going to watch other entertainment but you will not know. Now we can still tell but in 6 months nobody will be able to tell. Now what's funny is that even Mr. Mr.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Beast himself who is the king of entertainment you know the king of content of attentiongrabbing slop is worried about AI right so Mr. calls out AI as threat to YouTubers, Livelihood says, "Scary times." So, the most successful creator of manual slop is now worried about AI slope. So, that's kind of funny, but honestly, this is not really an issue for those who create content that isn't slop, right? So, the way I was able to summarize this into a single sentence is if you are in entertainment, pivot to education. If you are creating a content that's not valuable, doesn't bring any unique insight, any unique ideas, novel analysis, nothing inherent of value, you're just doing the same that everybody else is doing.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Don't be surprised when AI replaces you as well. And this is a very bullish message to those who are making educational high-v value content that is much harder to replicate, right? Content in flesh. When you show up in flesh, you know it's something of value. Now back to the positive side because we spend a bit too much on the doomer side.

### ⚡ セクション 31

But the fact is that agents are going to be available for everyone. Even if you aren't a programmer, even if you have zero skills, the release of agent kit is fundamentally revolutionary. It will allow millions of new people to build AI agents, right? Even though tools like natake.com have existed for a while, OpenAI backing something, right? OpenAI creating their own agent builder will expose it to millions, if not tens of millions of potential new AI agent builders.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Now, I have to be fair. The agent kit is similar to anything or make.com, right? It's not like they invented the light bulb. It's not a radical new technology, but it is a much cleaner and simpler design. It is easier to use.

### 🎬 セクション 33

It's more userfriendly, but it also does include some new features and some new tools that other platforms don't have. And so, in a second, I'll show you how you can start using Agent Kit yourself. But first, hear it from Sam on what it actually is. >> This is a canvas to build agents. It's a fast visual way to design the logic steps, test the flows, and ship ideas.

### 📋 セクション 34

It's built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use. >> All right, so now let's look at how to actually use agent kit. First, we need to go to Google while it still exists and type in platform OpenAI and click on the first link. Then you need to login with your CHBT account. So in the top right, click on your account and use the same one as using CHBT.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Takes 20 seconds. Then click on dashboard which will bring you here but then on the left you can see agent builder and this is where agent kit is located. So click on agent builder and you can either create a workflow from scratch or you can use one of these uh six templates. They're probably going to add more let's be honest. So they have data enrichment planning helper customer service structure data QA document comparison and internal knowledge assistant.

### 📝 セクション 36

Honestly probably data enrichment sounds the most interesting. So let's explore this template. And there it is. Here is the dashboard. You can see this one is very simple.

### 💡 セクション 37

We have the start node. Then we have a web research agent and the summarize and display agent. Simple workflow to research a set of companies using web search and provide summary analysis. Analyze Nvidia. Find a company using web search.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Okay. So this is very simple agent. Preview this. And this is nice. So you can see how it works by testing it right away with like a chat style interface.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Analyze OpenAI dev day. Let's use it on their own product. So there we go. start web research agent is going and then you're going to summarize and display this you can obviously do inside of JBT itself but I think this is just an introduction to how the agent kit could be used the first templates probably the simplest one the beauty is that you can see like the logs and all of this lives within open ecosystem so debugging this and building on top of this will be very very nice very clean all right so here we have the response view details I mean this is nothing crazy, right? So let's look at some other We lost the templates.

### 💭 セクション 40

Oh no. Okay, so this crazy. If you use any of them, you lose them. Okay, we still have the templates here. Yeah, keep in mind that as soon as you click on templates, you seem to lose them.

### 📌 セクション 41

That's kind of crazy. Let's see which of these is more. Okay, let's look at document comparison. Okay, this one is more advanced. So by the way, on the left we have the different notes, right?

### ✅ セクション 42

So the core is agent, we have end note and note. So this is a sticky note. This is built with React Flow by the way. So if you want to build an app like this yourself, React Flow is a way to do that. Pretty easy.

### 📚 セクション 43

So OpenAI again, they ship this in six weeks thanks to Codex. It's pretty impressive. I think each workflow comes with a pre-created start note start define a workflow inputs input variable input as text string. Very simple. This is clearly targeted for non-developers.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So then we have the agent. This is probably going to be the main node name agent. You can rename it. Instructions, the system prompt, include chat history. So, you can easily toggle this if the chat history shouldn't be included.

### 🎨 セクション 45

And then model, you probably choose all of them, right? Nano GP5 Pro, that's another thing that released in dev day. GBD5 Pro is now in the API. 4.1, I would recommend 4.1. Actually, a lot of people want to use GPD5 because it's newer, but for AI agents, GPD 4.1 is much more reliable.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Then tools, you can add bunch of tools. chat kit, MCP server, file search, web search, code interpreter or a custom function, output format, text or JSON. Wow. So you don't even have to instruct it to output structure. You can just select it here and then widget which is chatkit.

### ⚡ セクション 47

This is actually pretty good. You can do like some major prompt engineering here. You can add multiple different prompts. User assistant. Oh wow.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So you can construct the conversation history already. So this is like the system prompt. Look at this. We have assistant prompt. Then we have the first user prompt.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Then we can do assistant message response and then user again. So you can literally like this is one of the advanced pro engineing principles. You can prefill the conversation, right? So it looks like it already starts. Nice.

### 📋 セクション 50

This is nice. And then sticky notes are just for explaining your workflow. And then we have tools like file search. So this is the vector DB. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So you need to create it inside of the vector storage in OpenAI. So they're going to use their embedding tool to create a highdimensional vector database or vector store for this you know probably not a database if it's a single file but yeah and then you can use those inside of your workflow you can choose the k nearest neighbors select 10 and the query on how to cue it guardrails this is I think something that is the differentiator between agent kit and you know n10.com guardrails input as text personally and okay so we can clean personal undevelopable information moderation like harmful content or you know 18 plus content jailbreaking. So if you're building this as a back end, you know, you know the meme like lovable front end anytime back end, you can do like agent kit back end. You can literally build and this is the crazy part. You can turn this into code, right?

### 📝 セクション 52

So using agents SDK, you can uh copy paste this into your Python back end and uh build on top of it. And by the way, this would this might be a whole new video. Like if you want me to make a video on how to build an AI agent with agent kit and then deploy it into your Python back end so you can build on top of it and build a whole startup with this comment below because uh that's fascinating the fact that you can just click on code and instantly copy it and build your own application around it powered by agent kit. See, OpenAI destroyed hundreds of startups with this dev day, but they just made thousands of new startups possible that before were either not possible or at least like 50 times 100 times harder. You cannot like fully criticize OpenAI, but you cannot fully love them either.

### 💡 セクション 53

MCP. So, this is interesting. People talking about like how Enthropic invented MCPs, but OpenAI is actually the one that's capitalizing on them. So, we have MCP node. So, you can integrate u MCP servers.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Now, Agent Kit might not have as many integrations as other agent builders, but they do have the MCP node, and that's really all you need because there's an MCP that lets you connect to over 500 different apps. And that MCP is called RUP. So, if you're in agent kit and you activate the MCP node and you click on add, here you can add any MCP server. And if you add RUP, you can connect over 500 different apps through a single MCB connector. So whether that is Gmail, Slack, Perplexity, YouTube, GitHub or Superbase, RP has it all.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And the best part is you can just tell it what apps you want to connect together. Like in this example where you ask it to add a marketing deck from Google Drive into your Slack and it calls the tool and does that. Or maybe you need RP to write a follow-up email. Well, it can use the Gmail.create email draft tool and do exactly that. So instead of having to connect all of these MCPS one by one, all you have to do is connect RP and it gives you all of these apps with it.

### 💭 セクション 56

And thanks to the free plan, you can start using RP today completely for free. So if you want to connect over 500 different apps through a single MCP, go to rub.app and give it a shot or just click the link below the video. Thanks to RP for sponsoring today's upload. If else. Okay, so we have basic u programming logic while loop and then some data transform or set state.

### 📌 セクション 57

So these are already NA10 obviously. So let's look at this one. Start triage request. Let's see what's this. So this is an AI agent.

### ✅ セクション 58

Classify the user's request based on whether two documents have been provided recently in the conversation. Propose reconciliation. So these are all agents. This is interesting. This is a very interesting looking at this from the design choice.

### 📚 セクション 59

Right? In NA10 you have an AI agent. It's like a big node, a big block, right? Here like the if else is much bigger than agent. They make the agent like a small thing here.

### 🔖 セクション 60

And then this is like three agents here. It's no big deal. Just customize each agent for each scenario. This is a very interesting design choice how OpenAI thinks differently about the significance of an agent in a workflow compared to NA10. Yeah, this is looks much more like streamlined, simpler.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Doesn't mean it's better. NA10 is obviously more advanced. NA10 has way more integrations. But again, OpenI shipped this in six weeks. And this a lot of beginners will use this, right?

### 🚀 セクション 62

because the UI is more clean. OpenAI designers are amazing. Uh their I'm jealous of their UIUIX. Um yeah, if I had the budget, I would probably poach some of these designers to be honest. But yeah, um no nothing crazy here.

### ⚡ セクション 63

It goes to an AI agent, then it goes to user approval. If it's a rejection agent, they're just spamming AI agents. Like you could probably put some loop in here, right? But uh whoever designed this template is just not afraid to spam agent everywhere. And the output format is a test widget.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Look at this. Preview code, detach, edit. So this is chatkit, by the way. So if you're confused uh by all the releases, you're not the only one. But chatkit basically lets you build these widgets, right?

### 🎬 セクション 65

Which is like UI elements. Basically, this is like their own version of chat. Honestly, I might be talking complete now, so feel free to correct me in the comments, but uh yeah, this this feels uh like their own kind of UI framework. I mean they their own way of letting you build with their own UI design system basically. So you have the playground, you have the widget builder and the chatkit world.

### 📋 セクション 66

That's like a demo. So you can do a new widget, you can see a gallery of pre-built widgets, right? So like a calendar. Yeah. So basically this is like OpenAI designed components that they're kind of letting you borrow but not fully because you have to stay in their ecosystem, right?

### ⭐ セクション 67

Button. Okay. So you can build websites that look polished with this date picker. I mean other websites you know they I don't think they let you u take it fully. Let's see if this is the case or not.

### 📝 セクション 68

Did openi fully open source chat kit and all the elements inside? I highly doubt it but this is nice. Like we have a bunch of icons like 50 or whatever. Obviously not as much as some other open source libraries. The point is that you can easily design these UI widgets or UI elements with um you know very simple HTML style code and you can use these inside of your agent kit apps right this is this chatkit let's see no openi did not fully open source chatk kit here's what available openi released chatkit javascript components under the apache 2.0 license.

### 💡 セクション 69

This includes chatkit, react components. Okay, this might be a whole another video like how to build websites in the style of chatkit, you know, with these components, chart, icon, image, markdown, label, caption, title, and obviously you can do a new widget and you can just describe it using plain English and GPT will build it for you. Agents MD. Okay, so here's the system prompt. Nice.

### 🔧 セクション 70

They revealed the system prompt. You are an expert widget designer and developer. Outputs must be small compact widgets. Methodal methodology, complexity, budgets. What are widgets?

### 🎯 セクション 71

Widgets UI. Widget is a strict simplified version of JSX that only permits specific components and props. Wow. They open source the whole prompt. And this is a long prompt, guys.

### 💭 セクション 72

I'm still scrolling. This is a very long prompt. Oh my god, guys. We need to study this. Wait, how long is this?

### 📌 セクション 73

8,000 words, 55,000 characters. Guys, if your prompts are not this long, maybe you are not serious. Maybe you don't really care about your AI agents. This is a complete prompt engineering masterass here from OpenAI. They just gave away how to prompt AI agents.

### ✅ セクション 74

Wow. That that's that's amazing. That's actually amazing that they open source the agents MD. I clicked that completely by accident. But hey, I bet most people have skipped that and missed that.

### 📚 セクション 75

But this is what you get by watching the David Andre channel. If you aren't subscribed yet, go below video and click subscribe. It takes two seconds and the benefits are tremendous. It's a no-brainer deal. Uh it's a grand slam offer as Hermosi would say.

### 🔖 セクション 76

But yeah, this is the agents widget builder for aka also known as chatkit. It's not fully open source, but they did give us the components, some sample applications, documents, and guide. What's not open source? the core chatkit infrastructure remains proprietary back and services agent builder okay it's hybrid so so the UI components are open source and some of these icons so that's nice yeah anyways as I said this is a whole new video minimum this is like probably multiple videos so if you want a full dedicated video on using agent kit but more importantly the code right how to deploy this into your own application and there's also evas we haven't even touched on evas yeah there's a lot uh openi is cooking and wow guys we live in the future. We live in the future and u openai is about to monopolize the entire internet if nobody stops them.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Well let me know which videos you want me to make whether agent kit and how to build a whole application with this or whether chat kit and going more into these components UI um how to build your own widget. There is so much content it's crazy. So let me know which one I should make or if I should make all of them. That being said, if you watch until the end, thank you. Thank you for watching and I wish you a wonderful, productive week.
