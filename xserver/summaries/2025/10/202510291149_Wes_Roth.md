## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Well, we might be getting our first humanoid robot for the household. It's been announced today. It's Neo and it's going to be beginning to ship in 2026. As in, you can order it right now and it's going to get delivered sometime in 2026. So, I'm not sure if anybody expected this, but pretty amazing, I got to say.

### 📋 背景・概要

And I got to say the prices aren't absolutely insane. They seem to be I don't want to say affordable, but at 500 a month subscription to have this robot or to just purchase it for $20,000 outright, it's definitely within reach for a lot of people. The 500 a month package does seem like it would be useful, assuming you can do certain things around the house. It's not an insane price tag. So, let's watch their announcement video.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

We'll also take a look at Andre Karpathy reacting to this robot, which I thought was kind of cool. And at the end, I'll tell you the answer to the question that everyone seems to be asking. Can a human being somewhere out there use a teley operation to embody this robot, walk around your house at night, and potentially watch you while you sleep? The answer is, of course, probably not. Probably not.

### 📝 詳細説明

But let's take a look at their sort of announcement video. Check it out. My name is Burch and today we're launching Neo, our humanoid for the whole turn wall head move fast, stay alive [music] signal sparks across my scale vectors whisper don't derail latitude of appetite. Gratitude of fear at night. Memory loops frames rewind.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I feel tick tock. >> This all started a decade ago working really hard on making what is Neo a [music] reality.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

But to me personally, this started when I was like 10 years old. I grew up reading these beautiful books and watching these beautiful sci-fi movies where the future was all about how we as humans we really focus on the things that matter to us. You know, Rosie the robot would be ensuring family had time or data would help humanity explore the galaxy. And I really hope that when you get your Neo now, we can help give you back some of that time so you can really spend it on what you feel is very meaningful to you. Cold tail, long head burn.

### 🎯 応用例

It combines AI and advanced hardware to help with daily chores and bring intelligence into your everyday life.

### 💭 考察

Neo was engineered from the ground up for [music] safety. Its tendon-driven body is quiet and lightweight. Its low energy motions make it uniquely safe for you and your home. But safe doesn't mean limited. Neo's hardware comes packed with [music] features like human level dexterity and a 55 lb carrying capacity so that can handle any of your chores reliably.

### 📌 まとめ

We also worked really hard to make Neo's [music] design friendly and comfortable to be around. Each Neo comes with a machine washable knit suit, a head, and shoes that you [music] can customize to fit your style. As for using your Neo, we made the experience simple. Out of the box, the core of your experience is fully autonomous. The chores feature lets you schedule a time for your Neo to do all of your chores so you can come back to a cleaner home every day.

### ✅ 結論

[music] With the AI companion feature, you can talk to your Neo to get assistance with anything from a hard question to a household task. With Neo's autonomy, you can get access to all of its latest AI features to get help with tasks [music] on demand. And the Neo app lets you interact with your Neo from anywhere. But all you have to do to get started is turn on your Neo and introduce yourself. >> [music] >> Hey, I'm Neo.

### 📚 追加情報

I'm here to help around the house. What's your name? >> Harry. Nice to meet you, Harry. When you have a question or want something done, just let me know.

### 🔖 補足

>> We built the chores feature to give you your time back. You give your Neo a list of chores, you schedule a time that you want them done so that you can focus on what matters to you while your Neo does the rest. You can schedule chores by either talking to your Neo or using the app. The way it works is you schedule a time that works best for you and then you create a list of chores. Whether it's something more specific like watering the plants on Tuesdays or something more general like tidying the house, your Neo will get it done at the scheduled [music] time.

### 🎨 セクション 13

If there are any chores that your Neo hasn't learned how to do autonomously, you can use expert to have an expert from 1X supervise the session and provide corrective intervention to help Neo complete any task. [music] Anytime you're away from home and you want to see what your Neo's up to, you can open the app and see directly from Neo's point of view. [music] [music] >> [music] >> Yeah. [music] [music] Yeah. [music] >> [music] [music] [music] >> I can't seem to find my glasses.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Is this paprika? No, that's cayenne pepper. Also, your glasses are on your shirt. Could I use this in my chili? They're both made from chili peppers, and you could put cayenne in your chili, but it is much spicier.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Neo is a speech enabled AI companion made for any kind of conversation. Where other AI assistants are confined to your phone or computer, Neo lives with you in your physical space and has the ability to see, hear, and remember things about your surrounding environment to provide you with uniquely helpful assistance. For example, it can suggest what to cook based on what you have in the fridge, remember your progress while teaching you a new language, and even give you interior design advice. The gestures and the light rings express Neo's intentions. Its audio intelligence can also pick up on whether you are addressing it or someone else in the room to decide if it should respond or not.

### 🌟 セクション 16

As you might expect from a home robot, talking to Neo with natural language is the primary user interface for all of Neo's functionality, including autonomy. [music] >> Your Neo comes with Redwood AI, enabling it to do basic household tasks autonomously. [music] >> Yeah. >> No, for sure. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 17

What was that? Yeah. Yo, >> can you get the door, please? [singing] [music] >> What's the color of the night? [music] [singing] >> Neo's autonomy works by taking requests like, >> "Hey, Neil, [music] can you take this cup to the sink for me?" and breaking it down into simple steps such [music] as walking to the person, grabbing the cup, and then walking the cup to the kitchen, and then putting it away.

### 📋 セクション 18

Neo's autonomy improves with diverse data and real world experience. As Neo does more chores, you'll receive updates to your Redwood model that increase the complexity of tasks that Neo can handle, such as finding your keys and wallet or doing a full laundry cycle end to end. [music] [singing] for shame. [music and singing] Hide the secret. [singing and music] [singing and music] >> Eventually, Neo will become fully autonomous, capable of helping you with anything around the house.

### ⭐ セクション 19

[music] >> [singing] >> The Neo you get today will only get better. And as we keep shipping features, it'll be more and more useful in your everyday life. Now, the journey there is not going to be perfect, and we're not going to pretend it's going to be, but as someone who lives with Neo every day, there is no experience quite as magical. So today, we're excited to invite you in on this journey. We believe that the future will be shaped not just by us, but by all of you who believe in this as deeply as we do.

### 📝 セクション 20

Now, if this is you, pre-order your Neo today at 1x.te. Robert Scoble ran into Andre Carpathy at a reveal party for these robots a couple days ago, it sounds like. So, he asked him a few questions about how Andre feels about the robot, etc. One of the questions that he asked I thought was hilarious. Take a listen.

### 💡 セクション 21

>> What do you think, Andre? >> It's great. >> Yeah. What What are you doing? You You hugged him.

### 🔧 セクション 22

>> Yeah. >> I'm Robert Scoville, by the way. >> Oh, okay. >> Um, >> when you see a new technology like this, how what does it make you feel? And how do you look at this?

### 🎯 セクション 23

>> Well, it's so awesome, but it's also very early, but it's experience. >> Yeah. >> Narism. >> I mean, did you ever imagine when you were a kid that you would be embodied inside a humanoid robot someday? >> Um, yeah.

### 💭 セクション 24

[laughter] >> So, Andre is like, "Yeah, this is what we've been training for. This is what we knew was coming. This is the obvious next step. We'll have robots and be embodied in robots." But let's talk about the whole teley operation thing. So Wall Street Journal sat down with the founder of the company and they actually saw this 1x in Neo in action.

### 📌 セクション 25

Basically what we want is a robot that's fully autonomous, meaning that it makes its own decisions. It's fully operated by its own AI brain, but there's kind of this gap between capability and where we want it to be. We saw a lot of these robots currently the kind of the cool things that we see them doing, they're being teley operated. So you can kind of see that here. You have your headgear, you got your little controls, and you're able to move it around.

### ✅ セクション 26

Without those controls, they might not be quite as agile and awesome as we would expect them to be. Now, this is an earlier version, so this is not what's going to be shipped to your house. So, the struggle here to close the dishwasher door. Hopefully, we're not going to have it by the time this is shipped to our homes. But, I mean, under five minutes to load the dishwasher.

### 📚 セクション 27

And I don't know, it definitely seemed like it was struggling quite a bit. But, and this is kind of the big point that I think everybody needs to understand. The more data they're able to collect through teley operation people's homes, the more tasks these robots are exposed to, that's what in theory is going to allow us to kind of bridge the gap between where they are now and where we want them to be. So if you're purchasing this robot, it sounds like you should expect to have some teley operation from some remote person somewhere that's going to be inside your house that's going to be guiding this robot to train it to do tasks. as the founder of the company in this interview says, you know, initially a lot of the tasks, the robot's ability to do those tasks, it won't be phenomenal, right?

### 🔖 セクション 28

But as soon as the data starts coming in rapidly, we'll see an improvement. So, this is kind of an exciting time if you're the right person for this because you're helping to nudge this robotic revolution along by maybe, you know, maybe if you're not worried about some aspects of their privacy and and they take privacy very seriously. We're going to take a look at how they handle this in just a second. But if you're okay with all the things that some people might consider downsides, if you're cool with it, you would be helping in a very major way to help this company improve and get data and get better robots. As enough people buy this and provide data, eventually over time, the entire fleet of these robots will get better and better and better.

### 🎨 セクション 29

I am strongly considering purchasing one. So, we have three colors. So, we have kind of this gray, blue, and dark/ black robot. We have the standard monthly subscription, $4.99 per month. And we have early access, $200,000 for the ownership.

### 🚀 セクション 30

But let's take a look at the FAQs. So, US deliveries will begin 2026. First, the early access people, so the people that purchased the robot for ownership, followed by subscriptions. No other subscriptions are required. And will my Neo be fully autonomous?

### ⚡ セクション 31

Neo works autonomously by default for any chore request it doesn't know. You can schedule a 1x expert to guide it, helping Neo learn while getting the job done. Again, a human being will train it on a task within your home. The company gets the data in order to be able to improve the entire fleet of robots and your little robot gets to figure out how to do that specific task inside your home. Now, the obvious next question is, will one of these 1X experts be able to connect and enter my Neo at any time?

### 🌟 セクション 32

They're saying no. So, the owner has to schedule that and also their ear rings will light up when a 1X expert operator is active. Owners will have full control over each session. You can schedule it sounds like when you're not home. You're able to watch what's happening.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, you're always able to watch what your robot is doing through the app. And there's going to be ways to gate portions of your house and the robot cannot enter them. So if you're worried about them blocking into your bedroom or whatever, you're able to kind of block those areas out. So after kind of reading all this, to me personally, this doesn't seem that bad. Most of my concerns are sort of uh evaporated after this because again, I can schedule when that person is quote unquote in my house.

### 📋 セクション 34

I can gate them from going to certain places and it lights up if the situation is being kind of transmitted somewhere. So, you're able to see that. To me, that's very similar as having somebody like a maid enter your house or somebody fixing something up. So, some service person coming into your house to do something. It's the same thing, right?

### ⭐ セクション 35

You know they're there. You kind of tell them what parts of the house they need to work on, like don't go upstairs if you don't need to. And you can schedule when they arrive. They can't just magically appear inside your house. Of course, you do have the option to opt out from data sharing, which goes on to improve Neo's performance.

### 📝 セクション 36

So, everyone's performance. And you can use them inside and around your home. You don't want it to get wet. Contact with moisture may damage your Neo. And these 1X experts are employees physically present in the USA.

### 💡 セクション 37

It has a self-charge station, so it just kind of plugs itself in as needed. It's got a remote control, so you can pilot it from anywhere in the world through the mobile app and VR device. Standing at 5'6 and weighing 66 lb, it's not huge and fairly light if you think about it. I mean, some people will be able to carry it up and downstairs or from place to place if needed. And of course, the real test will be when the first people will start getting this inside their homes.

### 🔧 セクション 38

If it's able to do laundry and put away clothes and do some basic chores, even if just tidy up a little bit, I feel like that would certainly be worth it. I mean, paying 500 a month isn't a low price. That's definitely going to hurt a little bit. But depending on the sheer amount of work that it's going to be able to do, just think about it like on its own time, you can schedule it to do it whenever. In the evening, in the morning, at night, while you're away to work, it can pick some stuff up around the house.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And a lot of this stuff doesn't have to be done extremely well for it to be useful. Like if it just picks up all the stuff from the floor and puts it into some bucket, even that would be pretty incredible, assuming they can schedule it to run, you know, like a Roomba. I am extremely excited. I'm also a little bit worried because I'm just hoping that it doesn't get to the homes and just not able to do stuff like it. If it's useful, I will be absolutely blown away.

### 💭 セクション 40

And I'm very very excited for this. This progress is going fast. But let me know what you think. Would you buy something like this? Are you okay with some of the teleporation, you know, with the policies, with the rules that they've specified?

### 📌 セクション 41

Let me know in the comments. and I'll see you in the next
