## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

this sleep tracking app wanted $60 for their patented AI technology. So, I got suspicious and remade it for free. Sleep tracking apps let you place your phone next to you when you sleep and then it records periods where you snore, toss in bed, or are speaking. But guess what? Yamnet by Google detects all of those and is free and open source.

### 📋 背景・概要

It can even run on a smart device for crying out loud. You don't even need a data center or nothing. I then found a research study called measuring sleep efficiency by David Reed and William Sacko that gives a mathematical equation on how to determine a sleep score out of 100 based on how you wake, stay asleep, and more. You can then just split up the audio into parts where you can hear talking, snoring, or anything really, and then calculate that into the score. Create a simple UI and there we [music] go.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

This patented technology, I'm sure, works better. Okay, I only built this in like a day, but come on. Free and open source, you really can't beat that. Being petty just pays off.
