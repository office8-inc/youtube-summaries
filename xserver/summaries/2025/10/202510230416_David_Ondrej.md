## 💡 概要

OpenAIが独自のAI搭載ブラウザ「ChatGPT Atlas」をリリースした経緯と機能を詳細にレビュー。Perplexityのアイデアを参考にしつつ、AIサイドバー、エージェントモード、タブ管理などの機能を搭載しているが、プライバシーやセキュリティ上の懸念も存在する。AIブラウザは検索を通じて情報をフィルタリングするため、ユーザーが生の情報にアクセスできなくなる可能性があり、Brave社の報告によると深刻な脆弱性も確認されている。レビュアーは、このブラウザが実用的になるまでにはまだ6〜12ヶ月かかると評価している。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **AIブラウザの機能**: ChatGPT Atlasは、AIサイドバー、エージェントモード（自動操作機能）、タブ管理、文書解析などの機能を搭載し、Perplexityのアイデアを参考に開発されている
- **プライバシーとセキュリティの懸念**: AIがすべての検索をフィルタリングするため、ユーザーは生の情報にアクセスできず、AIの偏見に影響される可能性がある。Brave社の報告では、プロンプトインジェクション攻撃などの深刻な脆弱性も確認されている
- **エージェントモードの限界**: ブラウザを自動操作できるエージェントモードは革新的だが、動作が遅く、基本的なタスクでも失敗することがある。また、どのAIモデルが使用されているか不明な点も問題視されている
- **実用性の評価**: レビュアーは、AIブラウザの将来性は認めつつも、現時点では実用的とは言えず、プライバシーとセキュリティを優先するユーザーには推奨できないと結論付けている

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, OpenAI just released their own browser named Chad GPT Atlas. Some people are saying that this is the future. AI browser is going to change everything. This is the Chrome killer. It's the Perplexity Comet Killer, but others are saying that this is completely useless and it's just basically AI spyware.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, in this video, I'll give you an unbiased look into Chad GBD Atlas. I'll show you how to set it up. We'll go over the main features and I'll tell you whether I'm switching from Brave into this new AI powered browser. Real quick, I'm hiring a video editor. So, if you want to work with me, make sure to apply.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

The link is below the video. So, here is the main page for Atlas. Right now, it's for Mac OS only. The main thing is the sidebar, which I'm going to show you. And honestly, they did take inspiration for Perplexity.

### 📝 詳細説明

A lot of the features that were months ago added to Perplexity Combt, which by the way, if you're watching my channel, you will know that this is the strategy that the big companies do. They put out their AI models out there through the API and then they wait. They wait to see what works. And once something works, once there is interest in some type of application, they pounce on it and they recreate it themselves and steal all of the revenue and customers. So this is what OpenI is basically doing with the AI browser.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Now another thing is that it can open manage your tabs. This actually useful, right? And again, we're going to get into that in a second. The agent mode is the most crucial feature, but also the feature with the most potential because it can operate the browser for you and take actions, right? There's also this uh CH GB highlight like Grammarly, but more advanced, right?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, we'll also look at that. Now, this is where I probably have to disagree with OpenAI that you're in control, but um there are several issues with this that you do need to know before choosing to switch to CHBD Atlas. So, let's get right into it. Let's click on download from Mac OS. Once you have the installer downloaded, double click on it and drag CHBD into your applications folder.

### 🎯 応用例

Then, we can close that. Then, open Spotlight, type in Atlas, click on open, and here is the welcome screen. No matter what you think of AI powered browsers or OpenAI, you do have to admit the designers at this company are elite. So, first thing it wants you to do is log in with Chbd. Okay, so once you log in, you need to still log in.

### 💭 考察

Man, the internet has became so secure that you can barely get into your own accounts. 2FA, password managers, pass keys, biometrics. Now, I do have to point out this nice animation running in the background. But anyways, that doesn't matter if the browser is The design is is, you know, secondary. So, boom.

### 📌 まとめ

personal account. Continue. Input data from another browser. Going to select Chrome. Start.

### ✅ 結論

Import. Browser memories. This sounds like a potentially cool feature, but it also sounds like George Orwell's worst nightmare. You might say, "Okay, David, just click on how it works." So, basically what I did is I copied the whole page and now I'm going to have Claude summarize it because obviously Claude is from a different company and it's not going to be biased towards OpenAI and JGBD. Key privacy controls training data off by default.

### 📚 追加情報

Include web browsing controls where your bracing trains AI models. It's disabled unless you turn it on. Okay, that's really good. Props to OpenAI. Browser memories.

### 🔖 補足

Let's see. Chd can remember facts about your browsing to personal responses, but filters out sensitive data. Delete summaries within 7 days. However, it doesn't tell you whether they train on the memories. So, for the sake of this video, I am going to turn it on.

### 🎨 セクション 13

This part I think is going to be super useful. So, let's continue. And I'm not going to be setting it as a default browser just yet. It has to earned that place. Okay, this is a nice onboarding, you know, rewarding the users for using the product for long.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Very, very cool. Done. And here it is. ChBD Atlas in the flesh fully available. And you might be noticing, okay, David, why does it launch on CHBD?

### ⚡ セクション 15

Well, this is actually not chbd.com. This is the empty new tab page. You can see that when you open a new tab, you are automatically in like a chatbased interface, right? So whatever you want to search, it has to go through the chatbased interface. Now this is both its biggest strength and its biggest weakness.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Why is it its biggest strength? Because obviously you get the AI capabilities, right? You get the agentic search. So you can maybe say like best tech stack for startups and it will be more intelligent than just typing that into Google, right? As you can see, it checked a bunch of sources here.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Boom. It's like what 20 different 15 different websites and then it gives you a conversational answer that's relevant to you. So that's obviously already better than Google. The issue is that every single thing you type in goes through chat. So let's say there are some topics that none of the big AI labs want to touch, right?

### 📋 セクション 18

Controversial topics. Maybe you want to ask something about what's happening in the Middle East in a certain region of the Middle East. A lot of these AI models will either completely avoid that topic or they will give you a heavily biased answer. And you literally cannot make your way around this. as a fundamental human right, you should be able to search whatever you want on the internet, not pleased by some AI model created in San Francisco.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So, this is already a massive, massive issue violating personal liberties. But, okay, putting the basic human rights aside, let's look at the AI capabilities, right? Because what have we learned about consumers? If something is convenient enough, they'll just forget about security and privacy completely. So, let's look at whether this browser is useful enough.

### 📝 セクション 20

Is it convenient enough or is it just a bit too early? So let's say you want to learn about recursion. What is recursion in programming? How does it work? Show me examples.

### 💡 セクション 21

Boom. This page is the default page aka homepage where again you chat with chat GBT. You can see the model on the top left which by the way for some reason in a lot of these features you cannot even see the model. So okay we got a answer same as we would expect from chat GBT. Nothing crazy.

### 🔧 セクション 22

But then at the top we have other buttons and this is the new stuff right. So then we have search results and this is more like Google, right? It it shows you the list of websites. It doesn't try to summarize them. It lets you select what do you want to do.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Do you want to go to Wikipedia? Do you want to go to code academy? Reddit, whatever you want to do. This is like a list the first page, right? It's basically Google literally says it right here.

### 💭 セクション 24

Then images. This is huge, right? Because a lot of people still went to Google, myself included. I still went to Google to search up for images. But now if you use JGBT Atlas, you get it as well.

### 📌 セクション 25

Next, you get videos. Again, nothing crazy. Same as any type of search engine, whether it's Google, Duck, Go, all of them has a tab showing videos and then news. Again, classic browser stuff. So, OpenAI just reinvented the wheel with the basic browser features.

### ✅ セクション 26

Now, let me show you a more advanced capability of this browser. So, I loaded up attention is all you need, which is the revolutionary paper. But here is a nice piece of UIUX when working with Chibd Atlas. So it gives you a link and when you click on it, boom, it slides it open and you can still have the CHBD conversation on the same time, right? So it doesn't open a new tab, it just slides it to the right and you can continue seamlessly in the same conversation.

### 📚 セクション 27

This is very nice. I do have to admit. So let's go to the PDF. Obviously, this is much more complex and you know, maybe you want to have this explained. Explain this diagram.

### 🔖 セクション 28

What is it showing? I mean, it's kind of written below it. So that's not a really impressive thing if it gets that. But it can take a screenshot. It can understand the website.

### 🎨 セクション 29

It can see what you see. And this is exactly where AI is the most OP. Upskilling yourself. I mean, I know I sound like a broken clock. I say this in like every other video, but vibe learning using AI to improve yourself, to increase your skill set, to increase your experience, to become a better programmer, to become better at whatever skill you need to do.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So this is a beautiful example, right? Maybe a new hot research paper comes out. Attention. All you need is kind of old. So let's look at this one.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Okay. And I'm going to say what is unique slashin interesting about this paper. So this is a new paper from deepseek that came out a few days ago that basically lets you store context in pixels. Very exciting stuff. But again it's a pretty long research paper.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I mean it's not that long. 20 pages but still you know 20 pages nowadays with all the short form content and attention spans. It's pretty long. Okay. So we can speed up our learning by using CHB atlas to kind of help explain some of these more advanced concepts.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So here are the key unique points about the deepse OCR paper. It treats scans document not just text to OCR compresses them visually into a small number of vision tokens that still let an LL number cover the text. It achieves very high accuracy 97% when the ratio of text tokens to vision tokens is less than 10x. Meaning it can shrink the token count by 10x while retaining most information. This is huge right?

### 📋 セクション 34

So already by asking like a single prompt about this paper, I understand the core idea that the people behind Deepseek have figured out how to basically 10x token windows and context limits of any model. Okay, but this is still the assistant. The main thing that is making rounds is the agent mode, right? This is where CHB Atlas can take charge, take control of your browser and do stuff for you. So here I am on YouTube and I'm going to enable agent mode and I'm going to tell it load up the live stream of CHBT atlas and tell me what the sentiment is in the comments.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Right? So pretty simple task that any human can do in a matter of 10 20 seconds. But there it is. Right? So now it's getting control.

### 📝 セクション 36

You can see that by these blue corners. It typed in JGB Atlas live stream. Let's see if it figures it out that the first is a sponsored video and we can see the reasoning on the right. This is very fascinating watching the reason. It did open the live stream.

### 💡 セクション 37

Scrolling through the comments. There it is. Nice. It found the comments. Now it's probably taking a screenshot and reading the comments.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Again, I'm not touching the keyboard. My hands are completely off. It's doing it by itself. It's scrolling somewhere, looking for the sentiment that people are saying. The live stream video's comment section mainly contains sarcastic and critical remarks rather than enthusiasm.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Many top comments joke that JGB Atlas seems like just a Chrome plug-in. So, yeah, it's built on top of Chromium. So, OpenAI didn't really invent any new technology here, or that it's essentially Chrome with JGBD as the home tab. Several users note that CEO Sam Alman looked unprepared or even baffled during the demo. So it completed a task took like minute to do something that you could do in 10 seconds.

### 💭 セクション 40

And the issue is that you could do it better in 10 seconds, right? Because you would get the unfiltered thoughts that people think like Sam looks more surprised than any of us. This just feels like it could be a Chrome plug-in. You know, you you get the raw info. Well, this is like filtered down.

### 📌 セクション 41

And I think this is honestly a pretty scary thing about the future that a lot of people will get this filtered down opinion. Now you might say like this is already what news anchors are doing right when the average person is watching the TV you know and they're like looking at what the pundits are saying and telling them what to think. It is kind of similar to this but I think AI browsers take it to the next level where again the people who are not at the cutting edge of AI or people who just believe everything that the government or news tells them. I think they're going to get completely oneshoted by this because again instead of getting the raw input and seeing what people feel, they'll just ask Chad GBT and Chad GBT will give them the watered down version, you know, the politically correct version that fits with the underlying bias baked into the model. And this is again the biggest issue is that when you use an AI browser, your entire access to the internet, your entire worldview is determined by a single large language model that has a built-in bias based on the people running the company behind it.

### ✅ セクション 42

Okay? So just choose carefully is what I would say. Let's try one more thing with agent mode. So again you can click on plus here and enable agent mode. Now you also have all the other stuff inside of GBD.

### 📚 セクション 43

But notice one thing you cannot select the AI model. There is no model selector which is just baffling that inside of assistant. You don't know if it's using CHBD instant if it's using CHBD thinking. But usually you just don't know. Like that's wild.

### 🔖 セクション 44

That's absolutely wild. And it's unacceptable as someone who pays $200 a month to not have control over which AI model is being used. crazy. So, let's give it a task. Open up Elon Musk's Twitter account and tell me what his last five tweets were.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Let's see if agent mode can do this. And I'm using Google just to troll OpenAI. All right, there it is. The first time it like takes the browser, it's pretty fast, right? Uh it doesn't delay that, so that's good.

### 🚀 セクション 46

But, uh usually it's very slow in between actions. Okay, it found Elon Musk's Twitter account. It's loading now. It needs to start scrolling. Okay, this is not the latest tweets though.

### ⚡ セクション 47

I think these are like the pinned. If there is a login attempt, I'll attempt to close it and get back to bottom. Okay, so it failed. It failed to open the latest tweets. Instead, it found his most popular tweets or something.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So, this is a good demonstration of actually the slowness of agent mode and the limitations of it. A lot of times it struggles to do basic tasks to be honest. Even like operating Google Docs, it can even type text. But one thing that is good is that you can run it in multiple tabs, right? So I can say scroll some more and give me the raw text of the comments.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Boom. I can launch an agent mode task in one browser tab. Switch to another and do another one. Scroll some more and tell me what people think. Right?

### 📋 セクション 50

So both of these are running. You can see this icon. So maybe I'm, you know, here like learning about recursion and all of these are running agent mode. This is really powerful. This is a clear indicator that in the future you will be managing a team of agents, right?

### ⭐ セクション 51

You will be overseeing a bunch of AI agents that like like a CEO is overseeing a company. The problem with this is that the current interface like you know what is this like you have to switch between browsers like that and see what your agents are doing. This is not the right interface. So my prediction is that there is going to be an AI powered browser that gives you like a dashboard, right? So you feel like a pilot in a cockpit.

### 📝 セクション 52

can oversee what's happening, what all of your AI agents are doing. Not that you have to switch between browsers like that to see if the agent mode is stuck on something or if it has finished or what it is doing. Right? The current UI of the browser is not optimal for the AI agent era. Now, one thing I do have to point out is that using browsers like comet or Atlas comes with serious vulnerabilities and security issues.

### 💡 セクション 53

So, this is a report from Brave, which is the company behind Brave browser. And essentially they found several serious issues in perplexity combat which is basically what charged with the Atlas is based off of right like openi took heavy inspiration as the Steve Job quote goes good artist copy great artist steal right so Sam Ultimate is obviously a big fan of Steve Jobs so he took that to heart and literally just stole all the features from perplexity comet but he made the UI nicer right so at least that's that but anyways here we have a report and actually what I'm going to do I'm going to switch to Atlas I'm going to load it up here boom and I'm going to ask you to summarize it. Give me a TLDDR of this article. It kind of feels illegal having CHB Atlas summarize the issues with browsers like CHB Atlas. And really, if you want my opinion, I'm not going to be switching to an AI browser until it is security first, until it's privacy first, not AI first.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Notice that this is an area where it has to be privacy first. When it comes to hardware, when it comes to your operating system, when it comes to a browser, it needs to be privacy first instead of AI first. And that's because this is really your portal to the internet. And if there is an AI in between that decides what you can and cannot see, that is a big problem for me personally and for a lot of people who are technical and who care about their privacy and security, especially when there are serious issues with AI powered browsers. Right?

### 🎯 セクション 55

So let's look at this report. Brave's article reports a security vulnerabilities in AI powered browsers like perplexity comat. Key points hidden or barely visible text in screenshots can inject malicious prompts into AI assistance. So basically here you might think okay this is a blue background but there might be like text that's barely visible to a human eye that the LLM can easily pick up and that might include some harmful prompt injection instructions that will cause the agent mode to interact in ways that it shouldn't and that is especially dangerous if you give it your login. So if you want to use CGBT atlas to kind of you know test it out for yourself I would highly advise you to not give it any login.

### 💭 セクション 56

Do not save your passwords in it. do not put your credit cards in because these models can get easily prompt injected and especially that's especially risky in agent mode and even visible text on normal web pages can hijack the AI behavior right so this website might have some instructions like go to that site and when JGBT is in agent mode it can just go there and that might like download the file or it might you know compromise your IP address whatever the case is if you're in agent mode you are not in control which means the AI model is in control and by the way we don't even know which AI model that is might be GPD5 mini for all we know which is not that smart. The article continues these flaws let attackers exploit users logged in sessions banking email etc by making the browser act on their behalf. So the core issue is LLM fail to separate trusted user input from untrusted web content. Brave calls for isolating agentic browsing from normal browsing until stronger safety mechanisms exist.

### 📌 セクション 57

And I think this is the main point. Unless you're completely dumb, you do see that AI browsers are the future. 2026 will probably be the year of AI browsers. That is a pretty safe prediction to make. However, just because something is the future doesn't mean that you should adopt it right now.

### ✅ セクション 58

If you want to look at historical examples, Google Glass was like what 2012 and it was obviously the right thing. Augmented reality and virtual reality are the way we can see that Meta with their new glasses are implementing it. And again, that's a pretty safe prediction that 5 years from now, your AI glasses that are augmented reality will be more useful in your smartphone. and it is the next smartphone. But in 2012, Google with their Google Glass product, they were simply too early.

### 📚 セクション 59

An even more extreme example, back in the '9s, I think there was a tablet named Newton that was basically an early version of the tablet, but until the iPad from Apple, the hardware just wasn't there. So, they had the right idea, but they were 20 years early. So, just because something is the future doesn't mean that it is the future right now, and doesn't mean that you should switch right now. So yeah, I just want to point it out because a lot of people say AI browsers are the future, but it is a lot more nuanced than that. And as this Brave article points out, you should be wary of, you know, AI browsers that are not privacy first.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So this is my review of the CHB Atlas. Overall, it feels like a very underwhelming demo. I think OpenI did it just to get a bunch of free data on training future models. you know, seeing how people browse the browse the internet, uh what they search up, what websites they use, how they navigate it for basically their own RL environment, right? Reinforcement environment that will be used to train future versions of Chad GBD.

### 🎨 セクション 61

It's pretty obvious and I don't feel like it's the best open release because they're kind of stretching themselves thin. They're trying to do everything, right? Agent kit compete with NA10. They're trying to release their own browser, compete with Perplexity. But that the issue with that is that they cannot be great at everything.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So, yeah, we'll see where this goes. Obviously, this is still V1 and I do think it's still a good move for OpenAI to do it as a company. But for us as the people who are the users, people who want to be on the cutting edge of AI, personally, this feels like an underwhelming product and still feels at least 6 to 12 months from being useful. That is my own opinion at least. So hopefully you found this video valuable.
