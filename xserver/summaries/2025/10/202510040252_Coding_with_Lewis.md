## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

My bank wanted to charge me $17.63 to print old credit card statements. So, I used Python instead to teach them a lesson. I needed 3 years of credit card statements that weren't available on desktop. The mobile app had them, but only one at a time. Painfully slow.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, I used Charles proxy to understand what data the bank was giving me, as normal people do, and was shocked at what I saw. The bank was already sending every single statement in the request, but was hiding them behind a crappy UI so I would ask the branch on the phone to get them for me for a fee. That's when I got my Python out and grabbed the URLs that the bank already provided me and downloaded them all in just like a minute and a half. As any good developer, I took a 17-minute task and stretched it out over 3 hours. Never let them know your next
