## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

What if there was an AI agent like cloth code but with better UI? All of the best models and significantly cheaper. That agent is Droid created by Factory AI. This has to be the most underrated coding agent I've ever used. Real quick, I'm hiring a video editor.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, if you want to work with me, make sure to apply. The link is below the video. All right. So, to set up Droid, you need to go to the factory.ai website. We're going to use the terminal IDE version.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, select your operating system, either Mac OS or Linux or Windows, and just copy this command right here. Boom. Copy. Open up your global terminal. There it is.

### 📝 詳細説明

And simply paste it in and hit enter. This will install Droid globally on your machine. Next up, open your favorite IDE. And let's open an empty folder. And then press command J if you're using VS Code or any of the VS Code forks.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And here, simply type in Droid. And boom, there it is. As you can see, it has some inspiration from CL code, which is good actually because cloud code is the most polished and smooth coding agent out there. Well, maybe except for Droid. I think Droid might take the number one crown.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

You'll see what I mean in a bit. And later in the video, I'll show you my current setup for using AI in production because there are a lot of things I learned after spending well over a,000 hours coding with AI. So, stay tuned for that. Now, when you first set it up, you'll need to create an account on the website. So, just click on top right login.

### 🎯 応用例

When you set it up and when you add your cart, you get 20 million tokens for free. Yeah, 20 million tokens. Basically, you can use this to build an entire SAS and deploy it and still have like 10 million left. And by the way, later in the video, I'll show you how it compares to cloud code and codeex. All right.

### 💭 考察

So, when you launch Droid, the first thing is the model, right? If you type /model, same as cloth code, you'll already see that wow, you have all the options, right? We have um Codex, OpenAI model, Sonet 4.5, Enthropic model, GPD5, OpenAI model, Opus 4.1, Enthropic, Haiku, Enthropic, and Droid Core, which is GLM 4.6. I don't know if it's fine tuned version or not, but this one is open source, the only open source model on here. And actually, GLM 4.6 beats even Sonet 4.5 on many benchmarks.

### 📌 まとめ

So, we're going to use this one. And another thing to point out is that you can see how many credits it consumes next to each other, right? So, Opus is just retardedly expensive. is crazy. But GLM 4.6 is the best open source model currently and it's very affordable.

### ✅ 結論

I mean lowest multiplier here. So we're going to use that. The next thing you must understand about Droid is shift tab, right? So shift tab, you can see it switches between these modes. And there's way more modes than in codeex or cloth code.

### 📚 追加情報

So auto off. What does this mean? It means that all actions require approval. It will not run any terminal commands. It will not do any risky changes at all.

### 🔖 補足

You press shift tab again and we have spec. This is basically like a plan mode, right? Next up, auto low. This is u one of the most common modes you should use. It can do edits and read only commands, right?

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, it won't delete your database. Hopefully, it won't do any risky changes. Next up is auto medium. This is reversible commands, right? So, stuff that might be a bit more risky but is reversible.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, no worries. And then auto high. Basically, this is yolo mode. And yeah, that's it. Those are all the modes.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, we're going to be using mostly auto medium or autohive because we're going to be building something from scratch and we want to squeeze Droid to the fullest potential. So, I'm going to switch to spec which is for planning and we're going to build basically an army of deep research agent what could be called an ultra deep research. So basically let me walk you through the prompt right the user will provide a topic and based on that topic we will do a call to a reasoning model like haiku 4.5 which will give us 100 different search queries then we will dispatch web search agents asynchronously we will aggregate the results of their web search pass that to another reasoning model which will output a super high signal report so basically this is like having your own Mckenzie analyst anyways let's look at how droid works because this already is very different from cloud code first I send this. And I do have to say the GLM 4.6 model is very fast here. Their inference is amazing.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And by the way, if you want to try GLM 4.6 yourself, which is literally better than Sonet 4.5 on many different benchmarks, the easiest way to do that is inside of Veectal. In Vectal, you can use all of the latest and greatest AI models from a single place. Plus, we have features like slash commands that allow you to make preset prompts so you don't have to type the same stuff over and over or tagging of your tasks because this is a full stack productivity AI agent. And by the way, if you use the code October, you'll get a month of Veectal Pro completely for free, which gives you access to some of the best AI models in the world, including GLM 4.6. So go to vectal.ai, sign up, and during checkout, use the code October to get a month of Veectal Pro completely for free.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Okay, so let's look at the response. And I really want to highlight how this already differs from cloth code because cloth code would just be like doing some reasoning and you know it would run a few terminal commands. It would see okay this is an empty directory and then it would give you an answer. Look at what Droid did. So it also checked the directory which is correct.

### 📋 セクション 18

But then it did three different web search calls to figure out the correct documentation for all of the things I referenced. Right? So I mentioned I want to use Python. I mentioned I want to use open router. I want to mention I want to use perplexity API through open router and before it even suggested anything it made sure to understand the latest docs which is already a massive plus this will save you so much time so after it concluded it research only then it suggested uh architecture for the codebase actually I think we can probably simplify this so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select no keep iterating on spec and you can see that this is really good you have multiple options right so you can either click proceed with implementation or proceed and allow file edits and read only which is the low version.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Then you have the medium version or high. So with each implementation you can change the version. This is really good really nice customizability. You can really feel that the guys behind Droid dog fooded the product. They use it every single day and they like polished it.

### 📝 セクション 20

So I'm going to click no. I'm going to switch the model to Codex because that is the best model and I don't care what anyone else says. I'm going to hit enter, which will compress the conversation history to save tokens. So, these guys not only give you 20 million tokens for free, but they also have proper context engineering and context management to save you on tokens so you don't burn through tokens unnecessarily. Pretty impressive so far.

### 💡 セクション 21

All right, here we are. So, I'm going to say now make the plan even simpler and more concise. Boom. Uh oh. Error 400 status code.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Nobody. I'm not sure if this is um related to the AWS outage that was happening earlier today, but I'm going to try with a different model. So, let's try Sonet 4.5. Here we can select the reasoning effort. So, I'm going to do high enter.

### 🎯 セクション 23

This will compress the history again, which maybe we didn't need that. Let me just copy it just to be sure. Boom. Uh I'm going to do a new folder again, docs, new file. I'm going to do v1 architecture.m MD paste this in then we can easily reference this create v2 and make the plan simpler and more code size let's see if we keep getting errors or not all right sonet 4.5 works beautiful and another great thing is that you can select the reasoning effort for sonet 4.5 which you cannot do in cloth code right in cloth code you can obviously use terms like ultra thinking which is by this is the cloud code extension you can also do the cloth code cli right clot boom Enter here.

### 💭 セクション 24

You can type in like think harder, stuff like that. Or press uh tab to toggle thinking on and off, but that's about it. Like you don't have granular control over low, medium, and high. Obviously, the highest is the ultra thing, which gives you like this rainbow animation, but it's pretty inconvenient, right? If you just want to stay on highing effort, Droid lets you do that.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, basically, what I'm trying to say is that Droid is becoming a better cloth code than even Cloud Code herself. pretty wild. Uh, literally my AI stack is changing like monthtomonth. Like I cannot tell you guys what it will look like in a month. OpenAI might drop like GPT 5.1 CEX high and that might become the greatest model in the world, right?

### ✅ セクション 26

Who knows what will happen? Enforopic drops Opus 4.5. Gemini 3 is right around the corner. We might be all switching to Gemini CLI tomorrow. Who knows?

### 📚 セクション 27

Nobody knows. But for now, Droid is taking a lot of interest. It's making a lot of waves. Why? Because it supports all of the models.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, if you learn how to use Droid, you can use Gemini 3 when it comes out because they'll add it instantly, right? It's the same philosophy as I have with Vectal. With Vectal, you always have the latest and greatest models at your disposal. Doesn't matter which provider they're from. So, let's see.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Uh, ultra minimal architecture. Okay. Files. We can probably have a bit more files than than that. So, I'm going to keep it inspect.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh that is way too simplistic. Look at I'm going to type the file v1 architecture and let's design something in between. Only h having one Python file is a bit too minimalist. This is also one of my favorite problems like when AI overcorrects say like do something in between. This works in both front end and just you know in general architecture design.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Balance architecture. Okay, this already looks better. So, I'm going to do proceed. Since this is a new repo, I'm just going to allow it to go full ham. I'm going to give it full permissions.

### 🌟 セクション 32

But at the same time, I'm going to copy this and create a new file here. B2 architecture MD. Boom. Paste this in. Let's save that.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Close this. Get droid. All right. So, now it creates a list of tasks. And now it gets to work.

### 📋 セクション 34

Starts creating those tasks. So the first file is the config. py sets the open router API key, open router base URL and the models which we will definitely change these 3.5 hiku. Oh no, we need to be using 4.5. So let's fix that.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Luckily these are just open router references. So we go to open router and go high coup 4.5. Boom. Let's copy this. Switch back.

### 📝 セクション 36

Change that. So then we have perplexity. Let's double check that is correct. Roxer Soner Pro Soner Pro correct. And then synthesis for the final synthesis we want to use set but not 3.5 4.5.

### 💡 セクション 37

There we go. So we fix that. Let's also initialize the G repository. Get init dot get commit first commit. Make sure to learn how to use Git.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Takes like one hour, two hours, and it will pay off dividends forever. Especially if you're using AI for coding, okay? If you see these horror stories of people losing a bunch of progress because AI reverted file and they didn't use version control, that's because they didn't know how to use Git. So, stop being afraid of learning how to code and put in two or three hours to learn how to use Git. And actually in the new society I have a super simple guide specifically for coding with AI which is on the Git and GitHub fundamentals right here.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So inside of the classroom click on code with AI and underneath the Ultimax Cordex guide we have the GitHub fundamentals. This is 14 minutes that'll teach you everything you need to know about how to use Git and GitHub for coding with AI. Doesn't matter if you're complete beginner, doesn't matter if you have zero previous experience with Git or GitHub or if you don't have time. This is a 14-minute module. And by the way, this is just one of many resources we have in the new society.

### 💭 セクション 40

So if you're serious about AI, if you want to take it to the next level and if you want to write actual production ready code, then the new society is the place for you. Plus, every week we host a call where you can ask any question. This is currently the only way to get direct access to myself and to ask me anything. I can help you with your startup. I can help you launch your own AI business, give you feedback on your project, on your idea, whatever you want to ask.

### 📌 セクション 41

The new society call is the place for that. Plus, in the classroom, you also get access to how I built my own AI startup from zero, literally choosing the idea, creating the back end, everything, all the mistakes to over $10,000 of monthly recurring revenue. So, while most people struggle to even deploy their VIP code at Slope to the internet without errors, I've used AI to build a real app used by over 60,000 people and scale it to over $10,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue. And I literally show you how I did it step by step inside of the new society. So, make sure to join today.

### ✅ セクション 42

The link to new society will be below the video. Now, back to Droid. All right, let's see where it's at. So, it finished running. Nice.

### 📚 セクション 43

Created the eight files. Seems like we have whole codebase here. Let's see if it did anything else. So, we'll need to add the env file obviously. So, let's do that.

### 🔖 セクション 44

New file env. And what do we need in here? Just open router. Okay, let's copy that. Boom.

### 🎨 セクション 45

We also need a get ignore. So, I'm going to tell it create a comprehensive Hit ignore. Boom. Can handle that no problem because you do not want to commit your env file. That is a rookie mistake.

### 🚀 セクション 46

That'll cost you a lot of money if you do that. All right. So, let's jump back into open router right here. Keys. If you don't have an open router account, why you're doing uh create API key.

### ⚡ セクション 47

I'm going to name it um subscribe. If you're watching this, make sure to subscribe. And I'm going to give it a $5 credit. So, if you want, you can snipe it. I'm probably going to delete it anyway.

### 🌟 セクション 48

But yeah, do not share API keys with anybody, okay? What I'm doing is very irresponsible uh because I'm just trolling here. But yeah, treat them as passwords basically. And definitely never ever commit them to GitHub. That's why I created the ENV file here.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And you can you need to check that it's not being tracked by Git, right? So now we can do a new commit. Git add boom git commit created.get ignore. Okay, it's not connected to GitHub, but you can use git completely offline. A lot of people don't even know that.

### 📋 セクション 50

A lot of people don't even know that Git and GitHub are completely different things. Anyways, uh not that that's a separate video to be honest. Like if you want me to make a video on all of the essential software engineering concepts and you know programming lessons that you need to know for coding with AI. Not the you know other stuff, not the four years in college. I'm talking about like the 8020 the stuff that you actually need to know to build real software with AI.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Let me know if you want to see that video. comment below and I'll make it. Okay, so let's see. Here's how we set it up. pip install.

### 📝 セクション 52

Boom. I'm going to do new cond activate testing. This is my cond environment for testing. Let's install this. Okay, this is the env file.

### 💡 セクション 53

We have that already. And then just launching main app which failed. Oh, we need to add the research topic. Okay, my bad. What is GLM droid by factory AI?

### 🔧 セクション 54

Let's test that. Ultra deep research topic by factory AI generating 100 research queries. Okay, so few things. Okay, I'm going to put this on the left. We have error.

### 🎯 セクション 55

That's um you know what? I'm going to have Droid handle this error. Boom. Error. Paste this in.

### 💭 セクション 56

Boom. Let's encapsulate this from engineering with XML tags. Say investigate this error and fix it. In the meantime, because I want to work boom, another droid. This one, let's uh switch it to GLM.

### 📌 セクション 57

And I'm going to do hi. I'm going to say update the core running logic of the app to output a lot more progress print statements into the CLI updating the user what is going on at every stage of the process. Okay, right now I didn't like how few things were there. Let's look at this guy. Okay, so it's adding regular expressions here.

### ✅ セクション 58

Oh, it's for parsing. issue was par. Okay, that's not the best though. I was just improving the reliability of the JSON parser. I don't know.

### 📚 セクション 59

Okay, whatever. I mean, watching Droid work is really like a pleasure. It's architected really well. Obviously, like it uses the same models that are available in open router, but it's all about the scaffolding, the tools, the UI. Yeah, it's very polished.

### 🔖 セクション 60

The team clearly knows what they're doing. And in fact, I posted on Twitter that I'm testing out Droid and within minutes, the CTO followed me and one more person on their team followed me. So the guys at Factory AI are locked in and that's a very strong indicator of this product I think will do well over the next coming months. So a lot of people, you know, they kind of don't like switching from codeex to cloud code to, you know, droid whatever. The benefit of droid, as I said, like you have all the models, right?

### 🎨 セクション 61

If you get familiar with this, I think you'll be in in good hands over the coming months. But to be honest, Codex right now is um is OP. Codex is OP. I mean, if I had to select access to only one AI coding tool, it would have to be Codex. Both the extension and the CLI, right?

### 🚀 セクション 62

You can do like Codex. Boom. And can select the model GPD5, medium. Usually medium is good enough. And yeah, Codex is just amazing.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Like it's very strong. It's slower because it puts way more effort towards reasoning, but it's super strong. It's super good. It makes way fewer mistakes than CL code. Yeah, OpenAI really cooked with Codex, GPD5 CEX, this fine tune version of GPD5.

### 🌟 セクション 64

And honestly, I cannot wait for the next version. The problem is I have no idea what they're gonna name it. like GPD 5.1 Codex, GBD Codex V2 high. Yeah, OpenAI is terrible at naming, but whatever they're going to do, I can't wait for the next version of Codex because yeah, OpenAI is amazing. And the beauty of Droid is that it will support Codex as well as long as OpenI releases it in the API, of course.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So, let's see what's happening. Uh, change key. Boom. That's that. Let's check the other Droid.

### 📋 セクション 66

It closed the sidebar here. It added a bunch of print statements to update us as it's running. Add visual emojis into the different pages. I would be very curious what they use for inference of the GLM 4.6 because it feels fast. It feels very fast.

### ⭐ セクション 67

I don't know if they have their own stack or not. Wait, I don't know why my Chris Luno stopped playing. There we go. It's essential like if you listen to Chris Luno during vibe coding, it it boosts your productivity by 25%. There's several papers on that.

### 📝 セクション 68

Okay, let's see. So, we can run it again. We don't have to wait for these emojis. Okay, I complimented for being fast and now it's slow. Amazing.

### 💡 セクション 69

Okay, we're going to clear this. We'll get Let's get ready for that. We can kill here. So yeah, the beauty of having something in the CLI is you can run multiple droids, you know, one doing UI, one doing bug fixes, another one implementing a new feature. It's really it's really nice.

### 🔧 セクション 70

And I think factory they kind of designed it like that, right? They understand that AI agents won't be a singular agent. Like year ago, two years ago, everybody thought that oh there just be one massive model like GPT7 they'll rule rule the world. In fact, the trend is completely opposite right now. Mortals are getting smaller and it will be much more likely that humans work alongside agents and each human is managing dozens of different agents specialized for different things, right?

### 🎯 セクション 71

So the difference uh here is that um factory AI decided to go with the name droid instead of agent. But you get the point. Like you're going to be managing multiple droids and working with them. Okay, let's run it. Boom.

### 💭 セクション 72

We have much more inputs. We can see temperature. Yeah, it's much more visual. Very good. All right, we have the queries.

### 📌 セクション 73

Seems like successfully generated 101 queries. Okay, I don't know why Sonet 4.5 or Hiku 4.5 blessed us with an extra query. But now we're doing the async running. Um, it's not really fully async. seems like in batches, but that's fine.

### ✅ セクション 74

We're spamming perplexity API here. Boom. Sona Pro. Let's look at my open router how this is handling. I mean, I've already spent like over 10k here, so it doesn't matter.

### 📚 セクション 75

But, uh, no activity. As you can see, we're going to spam this. A lot of Sonar Pros happening, which means uh, this is working, right? Maybe we can probably reduce that from 100 to like 20 for testing, you know. But let's let it finish, actually.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Maybe a better architecture would be to do one search, web search to figure out what that is and then once you know a bit about what that is, you could do like you know the 100 queries in a much better way. Yeah, I think that's actually much better. So I'm going to go back here. Here I'm going to say let's improve the design of our app by inserting a new web search step at the very beginning so that right after we have the user input we do a quick perplexity pro API call via open router to get basic and general info about what the user means. Then after we know the user intent and a bit about the topic, we would use Iiku 4.5 to generate the 100.

### 🎨 セクション 77

The rest of the program needs to remain the same. And I'm going to switch to spec mode being hard about the minimal set of action required to execute change. Fewer lines of code the better. Okay, look at our program here. Boom.

### 🚀 セクション 78

We finished search execution. Total content 300,000 characters. So yeah, this is way more than any deep research. And let's see, do we have the report? What is it named?

### ⚡ セクション 79

Okay, it's reasoning. It's still going. Max tokens 16,000 ROM length 80,000 characters. So, we did some compression or what? Yeah, that's not the best.

### 🌟 セクション 80

We need to use a model that can handle 1 mil. Maybe we should use a Gemini here. Let's check it out. Actually, Gemini, man, I can't wait for Gemini 3. It's right around the corner.

### 🎬 セクション 81

This guy has 1 mil. We can also use GB. GB5 is like 400k now. 400k. That could work.

### 📋 セクション 82

But set 4.5 has one mil on which providers though all of them. Why did it truncate? Okay. I I don't know why it's confused. Maybe it's just confused about that.

### ⭐ セクション 83

But it's still going. That is suspicious. Okay. I don't know how I feel about that. Let's launch this.

### 📝 セクション 84

Next up, I'm going to do this. Boom. Paste it here. Processing image. Paste an image.

### 💡 セクション 85

Very nice. Oh, this is this is much better than codeexer cloth code image handling. Okay. Wow. So, I'm going to say update our context cutoff logic so that it assumes one mil token context window and not 80,000 characters.

### 🔧 セクション 86

That's that's some [ __ ] Also, each token is roughly three to four cars. We can use way more than 80,000. Okay, I'm going to add some exclamation points because that's crazy. This is stuck. This is stuck.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Okay, whatever. I'm going to kill this. Both of our droids are running. Okay, now this one's not running. Give it full specs.

### 💭 セクション 88

We need another droid, guys. We need a full droid. Boom. This one is going to uh be again full running. I'm going to say find where the 100 number is hardcoded aka how many v variations we demand and then extract that into a you can use the file here.

### 📌 セクション 89

Okay, it's actually here. So I'm going to do just answer. I'm going to switch into spec. And if it's properly propagated, we can just change it to 20. Is that properly propagated through the full vertical implementation of the code?

### ✅ セクション 90

Let's look at this guy. Yeah. So it's going to be make it 3 mil lat. Boom. What about this guy?

### 📚 セクション 91

What was he doing? Okay, it added extra step. That's correct. Is properly propagated. Okay, change that to just 20 for testing purposes.

### 🔖 セクション 92

Boom. And we should probably commit to get because we're spamming so many changes. Let's try to summarize it. The mo most important change is adding the new step. Added a new research step start.

### 🎨 セクション 93

This will make the 100 queries way more relevant. So this is done. This is done. Uh this still needs permissions. Boom.

### 🚀 セクション 94

Okay, that's a simple change though. We should probably be able to run it again. And let's change the query. Let's not be boring. Tell me, tell me about today's AWS outage and how to protect myself as a startup founder from this [ __ ] Boom.

### ⚡ セクション 95

What? Okay. What am I trying to commit it? That's crazy. Uh, anyways, we need to do python main.

### 🌟 セクション 96

py. Boom. Okay, there we go. Let's go. All right, so the max concurrent is 10.

### 🎬 セクション 97

So it's better than doing 100 async. I don't even know if open hour can handle that. So first we're doing what? Peroxy son pro for initial research. There we go.

### 📋 セクション 98

We have it. Then we generate 20 queries with haiku 4.5. And now we go. This is a much better approach, much better architecture. And if you wanted to go even crazier, by the way guys, you can do the perplexity deep research, which is more expensive.

### ⭐ セクション 99

But imagine doing this for 100 different queries. Yeah, this would be the most u the most photo ultra deep research agent in the world right now. It literally is like having your own uh chain street or your own accenture, your own Mckenzie. Okay, what is going on now? Building resilient architecture.

### 📝 セクション 100

Did it completed completed? It's still waiting on some of them, I guess. There we go. Max token 16,000. Okay.

### 💡 セクション 101

I don't like that. Change the max tokens of the summarizing agent to be uh 64,000. Boom. This guy tends to get stuck. So, I'm going to use another droid here.

### 🔧 セクション 102

I'm going to use browse the web to properly to ensure we have properly configured the reasoning effort for the summarizing agent. Check how this is done for infropic models using open router API. Boom. Let's go back here. This guy's finished.

### 🎯 セクション 103

This is like taking way too long. Context prepared. Yeah. So this is since we did only 20 instead of 100. less less characters.

### 💭 セクション 104

That's good. I don't like how long this guy's reasoning. And also the temperature should be less. Make the temperature 0.2 of that agent because for summary, I don't want it to be creative, you know? I don't want randomness.

### 📌 セクション 105

I want it to be consistent. So 0.2.1 is what I'm thinking. I don't know if this there's something sketchy here. It should not take this long. I can call it out here.

### ✅ セクション 106

Think that it gets stuck at this point. Uh, I'm going to do runtime. Boom. Paste in the logs. Run time.

### 📚 セクション 107

Something is wrong in the last step. It keeps getting stuck during the summarization process. Let's see if it's really stuck. Yeah, it is. This guy is still researching.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Maybe I should give it to the same H actually reports improvements we can make. It's not about improvements. It's about like getting stuck. Yeah, this is not good. 4.5 doesn't take that long.

### 🎨 セクション 109

We might have an error here almost certainly. It's missing the reasoning parameter. What? Well, I'm going to do issue issue. I'm going do fix.

### 🚀 セクション 110

Okay, whatever. Fix this. Boom. In the meantime, let's launch uh new D research. Explain our current implementation in detail as well as what the issue is.

### ⚡ セクション 111

So, I'm going to use Droid to explain this and I'm going to use deep research here to get the docs. Our ultra deep research agent can be running smoothly. What the [ __ ] is this output budget 20,000? No, make it okay. Let's make it 30k.

### 🌟 セクション 112

Make it 32,000 instead, not 20k. Uh, let's switch to this droid. Let's copy this. Boom. I'm going to here I'm going to give it context.

### 🎬 セクション 113

Paste that in. Above is the essential context about our app. Tell me the proper open router talks to handle this. It's very possible that Droid already figured this out in here. Just need to change the reasoning amount.

### 📋 セクション 114

This is our Okay. So, I'm going to copy this. It's a good description of what we did. I'm going to stage all files and do a commit. Make sure to do a commit like every 10 minutes roughly.

### ⭐ セクション 115

So yeah, do a lot more commits especially if you're using AI because u inevitably AI will mess something up and you will want to fix it. So let's Oh wait, we research process completed successfully. Wait, wait, wait. Where did it save it somewhere? I'll put it here.

### 📝 セクション 116

Does the current summary agent save the response into an MD file or just dump it into terminal? Okay, I think it just outputs in the terminal, but it worked. This is a very long summary though. Where's the prompt? I'm going to ask where is the system prompt of the summary agent.

### 💡 セクション 117

We need to change it. Report synthesizer. It's probably going to be here. There it is. Is prompt you following.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Make the report concise. The goal is to achieve super high signal ratio. meaning the final report must be short. Okay, five exponential points. Make it save into a txt file.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Okay, make it say into uh MD file. And I'm also going to tell it use clear proper and visual markdown. Boom. Let's save that. Destroy is going.

### 💭 セクション 120

So, this output is way too long for my taste. It's not good. I don't care how much info there is. Nobody's going to read that. Okay, that's good.

### 📌 セクション 121

That's nice. Where is the execute free comp? Okay, so it wants to ignore the reports so we don't spam our kit. Fair enough. That's good.

### ✅ セクション 122

And updates the read me as file as well. This is nice. So, Droid doesn't do just what you told it. It really makes it so that you can keep working on this project, right? Because uh most coding agents would just do the change and forget it.

### 📚 セクション 123

They would not update documentation. they wouldn't care. But Droid does that. Droid does care. It does update your recommendation.

### 🔖 セクション 124

It's really well architectured, right? So, it's clear that u the guys behind this are software engineers. Let's run it again. Boom. Let's learn about the AWS outage.

### 🎨 セクション 125

Okay, we do see the queries here. But I would like to see the first like 200 characters. Update the print. Okay, I'm going to say add another print statement right after we receive first a web search output the isolated one after user input to print the first 200 cars of the Flexity Pro API API call into the console just to see that we have it. Do not change anything else.

### 🚀 セクション 126

It's also nice. You can see the total session time here. That's a probably like a good proxy to when you should reset reset to a new session. Okay, now we're going back to 64. Reasoning enabled 32 new temperature.

### ⚡ セクション 127

Nice. We also have a hard time outside here. Make this more robust so our app doesn't stall. We're pasting in 70,000 characters. That's fine.

### 🌟 セクション 128

Should see a new reports folder with the MD file there. Okay. And clean as list slicing and Python is so OP. Okay. Research process completed successfully.

### 🎬 セクション 129

We have a new reports folder. We have the MD file here. It's still very long, but not as crazy as before. And you can see this is packed with information, right? AWS outage protection guide for startup founders executive summary.

### 📋 セクション 130

On October 27, AWS experienced a major outage originated in use. US East1, North Virginia 16 core services. Okay. Include disrupting nearly 50 major platforms including Snapchat. Man, some people are going to lose their streaks.

### ⭐ セクション 131

That's crazy. Really like national tragedy. Roblox. That's even worse. critical business tools three hours.

### 📝 セクション 132

Okay, that's uh pretty bad. Single cloud dependency is a systemic risk. This report provides actual strategies to pro protect your startup. AWS outage patterns major outages occur almost yearly. This year I had multiple incidents.

### 💡 セクション 133

Uh second one second really bad one this year. Imagine working at Amazon when this happens. Like must be like crazy. Okay, let's look at the protection strategy. Recommended SLA for early stage startups 99.9%.

### 🔧 セクション 134

I mean, look, if you have the same availability as AWS, you're probably chilling. And yeah, for a startup, it's not even worth it aiming for 99.99. Just like the infra setup, you need to validate a product. You need to build an MVP, get some, you know, traction. You don't need to worry about uptime as a early stage startup.

### 🎯 セクション 135

But a way to protect yourself is multi-AZ availability zones. Okay. Multi-reion. So maybe like one in US, one in Europe. Multicloud strategy.

### 💭 セクション 136

This is definitely not for startups. Yeah. After you get 1 mil arr like GCP, Azure, AWS or you can do like your own like headner VPS servers. There's a lot of options, right? And I think this report probably covers them pretty extensively and it also tells you like for different stages how much you need to worry about this.

### 📌 セクション 137

Yeah, this is a very good report actually and uh yeah, actually I might use this agent myself for when I need way more info than a singular deep research, right? Because sometimes you don't even know like in what direction you should be doing the research and that's why I added the first two steps where first it tries to understand what you mean by doing a quick like provisionary search on the web to get some context. Then it reasons about that and outputs 100 or like for testing it's 20 but like 100 different search queries. So then the reasoning model does the hard work. It's like thinking about how to research this on the web and then all of these 100 can do a deep research of their own and then the final model which is also reasoning model aggregates all of that into a single report and gives you a clear empty file.

### ✅ セクション 138

And if you're smart, uh, you can and if you're a consultant, you can easily repurpose this for some real US dollars. You know what I mean? But that being said, this is Droid. You can see it's very powerful, very versatile UI, better than CL code, which is a very high compliment. Definitely better than CX CLI.

### 📚 セクション 139

And I would even say better than CL code. Like you can see the pasting of images, right? You can take another screenshot and paste it in. This is much better. Boom.

### 🔖 セクション 140

processing image as at the top. You can like see it, manage it. Yeah, this is a this is a great coding agent that I wish I tried earlier to be honest. So, if you want me to make more videos on Droid and or any other new, you know, AI coding project, coding agent, open source repo, make sure to subscribe because I don't think any other channel covers things in depth as me. Obviously, there's channels that are spamming news.

### 🎨 セクション 141

There's [ __ ] ton of those like lowquality new spammers, right? But the difference is they haven't built a real startup. They haven't spent over a year, well over a thousand hours and well over $100,000 building a software company, a real startup that was used by over 65,000 people in production. They haven't done that, right? So their opinion doesn't matter.

### 🚀 セクション 142

I've done that and that's why you need to subscribe and that's why you're watching this channel. So yeah, if you're watching until the end, make sure to subscribe. It's completely free, takes two seconds and will make sure that you don't miss these videos in the future. That being said, thank you guys for spending the time for watching this video and I wish you wonderful productive week.
