## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

What would you say your biggest problem in life? >> H I would say finding a good restaurant. If someone could just build an AI for this, oh god would change my life. >> I would say booking flights. If someone could just build an AI for this, that would be life-changing.

### 📋 背景・概要

Fair enough. [laughter] >> Easy. Finding clothes I like is so hard. If someone could just build an AI for this, I would pay $1,000 a month. >> A thousand?

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

>> Without even blinking. >> Yes. This is more important than science. H is it >> okay? So, I don't know if people like those jokes, but I've been just having a lot of fun lately with Sora 2, experimenting and trying to create this funny post.

### 📝 詳細説明

Uh, but yeah, let me know in the comments if I should stop doing them. Uh, but you today, uh, we are looking at Imagine with Claude. I don't know if you've seen this. Uh I've tested it out a few times and I thought yeah why not just to make a video on it because it is pretty interesting and it could kind of be some part of the future of uh coding software everything right so Claude imagine or imagine with claude generates software on the fly so no functionality is predetermined no code is pre-written what you see is claude creating in real time right responding and adapting to your request as you interact So I'm going to show you how this works now. So if we go here to claw imagine I can turn off the dark mode now I guess.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Okay. So you can see now imagine with cloud. So when I click on this now we're going to open something like a yeah OS. So here you can kind of see this looks more like a like a Mac OS a Linux OS right. We have some notes here and down here we have like um uh yeah input box.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So what we can do now is let's say we wanted to add something to our OS here. Create a file explorer with a file name agentic aai.txt. Click enter. So now you can see we are generating kind of this UI here in our operative system on the fly. Okay.

### 🎯 応用例

Yeah. We get like a file explorer here. You can see we have a user documents. We are popping up with a file here agentic txt. Perfect.

### 💭 考察

And it says that this is 2.5 kilobytes. It's a text document but of course this file doesn't have anything in it. It's just like an illusion of a file in our system. So what happens now if I click on this right now we have to generate some kind of content either we do like a yeah we do a new popup and this file has to have some kind of content too and now the we have to write this right so you can see aentic AI the future of autonomous systems and we go on to create some text here. I wouldn't say this was perfect, but this kind of shows the idea of that we are generating this software on the fly.

### 📌 まとめ

We did of course not have this file on our system because there is no system. Everything is kind of an illusion. So I can close this now and now we can try to do some more things. We can do add a file name mind sweeper.exe. So now we should kind of have this file explorer here in context already.

### ✅ 結論

So we should be able to just add the file down here. Yeah, it kind of understands that it knows that this is an application. It has like a fake file size. So what happens if we click on this now? So we are kind of expecting when I click on this now that this of course what does it have to do?

### 📚 追加情報

It has to generate a game because the user is expecting that this is a game even though there's no code there. Now when I click on this now uh this should in theory now start generating the game for us on the fly. And you can see that is exactly what it's doing. It's creating mind swiper. We have some yeah number of bombs.

### 🔖 補足

We have some rows here. And you can see it has to generate the game before we can play. So I would say this kind of fail hard because look at this game. That's not how mind sweeper is played. Well, let's see what happens if I click on here now.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So now it has to actually write the code for what happens when the user clicked on the on the tile here. Okay. So you can see we kind of changed the icon here. So that means that we hit a mine. Uh yeah, it didn't really show that, but you kind of get the idea, right?

### 🚀 セクション 14

So let's close out this. We don't want to do anything more with this. So what else can we do here? Let's say this was your operating system and you needed to do some kind of Excel work. I need to do some work in Excel.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Add the following numbers. Find a sum and do the numbers. Okay. So let's see what happens now. So now you can kind of see.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay. So we need to build an application that can actually execute uh that is kind of the idea right. So we can execute uh uh Excel operations and you can see we have the A4s equals sum A1 to A3. So now we just add those numbers into this cell and we should get the sum down here. Perfect.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So was that the correct numbers anyway? I don't know. It doesn't matter too much, but you kind of see we generated this Excel uh program on the fly because the user said, "Oh, I need that for this operation." So, okay. So, that was done. So, let's see what happens if the formula is correct.

### 📋 セクション 18

Now, what if I say change this to 6,000 and hit enter or let's say 60 and I hit enter. So, you can see user hit enter and now we did the calculation, right? So you can kind of you kind of get the point here. So let's close this. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And let's do something else. So let's say you really needed to draw something. Uh I need to draw a parrot on a canvas, but I don't have the software on this system. Help me. Right.

### 📝 セクション 20

So what happens when we press enter here? And yeah, this is what we ended up with. Look how cool this is. It did even draw the parrot. And we have paint, right?

### 💡 セクション 21

We have our tools. It draw the parrot for us. I think that much better than I could do in paint drawing a parrot. If you ever need some kind of software tool uh instead of uh uh buying it, downloading it, you can just use LLM's generative AI to actually generate the tools you need in time, right? Or in real time.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So that is just super interesting. Okay, so let's see what happened. I do paint a horse riding into the sunset. Okay, so you can see we are kind of drawing the sunset first. We get a nice land here.

### 🎯 セクション 23

And now we are doing the horse. Uh, is that it? Okay, we get some more. [laughter] That's a funny horse though. But yeah, you kind of get the point.

### 💭 セクション 24

We couldn't draw on the painting, but we could instruct the software to draw the painting for us. Okay, so I think you kind of pretty get uh get what I mean here now. So let's see what happen if I click on claw code here. So of course now it has to try to generate claw code. Uh, I guess they already have the context put into this, but you get the idea, right?

### 📌 セクション 25

I could in theory generate cloud code from scratch if I just wanted to use it. So, yeah, you kind of get the point. This looks exactly like cloud code. I guess it has some kind of uh um context here on this. Uh, but yeah, that is kind of the idea.

### ✅ セクション 26

Building software on the fly. Could this be the new uh paradigm in uh how to use a computer? I think it actually could be, but of course, uh, a lot of things have to happen before that is viable. And I thought it was just a very interesting way of thinking about things. Uh, it's it's not like a new thought, but I think they did a pretty good job here of kind of giving like a demo of how this could work in the future.

### 📚 セクション 27

So, yeah, hope this gave you something to think about and it was interesting. I think it's only for u max users now on cloud code. uh but it will probably get available to everyone uh soon anyway. So, so yeah, thank you for tuning in.
