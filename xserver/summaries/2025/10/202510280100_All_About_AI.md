## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Today is going to be start off something I have been wanting to try out for a while and that is creating this trading AI agent. Uh I've seen a lot of like post and stuff about this. There is this uh paper or some some kind of research they are doing this now on um hyperlquid with um with cryptocurrency. So I kind of wanted to do my own version of this and I probably will do a hyperlquid version too. Uh but this is kind of the setup.

### 📋 背景・概要

It's not the most advanced setup, but I try to bring in context, find some tickers with high volatility because we're going to do CFD trading uh and intraday. So, you can see uh how I set this up is I'm going to run Cloud Code as the agent and I built some MCP servers. Uh one is kind of on Yahoo Finance just to get the closing price and um yeah, after market price for the stocks. Uh we have an X MCP. So we can look for sentiment on X also on Reddit.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh especially like on Wall Street Bets and yeah other subreddits we can look at sentiments. So the agent is going to be kind of like a sentiment analysis and try to pick tickers and stocks for us. And it's also going to do kind of the setup for the trade. I think uh basically we use cloud code, we use the tools we have. Uh I'm going to show you.

### 📝 詳細説明

We have some more things we need in place. I'm going to show you. But basically, we use the MCP servers to find the stocks with high volatility and high sentiment. And based on this context, we're going to ask the agent to suggest some trades for us. So, we're going to start off with $1,000.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And we're going to see uh at the end of the week how much we have. So, today is just going to be me explaining the agent, showing how it works, and placing the first trade. and I'm going to come back at the end of the week with the follow-up video. So, let's just head over there. I'm going to show you a few more things before we get this started.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, another tool we use is apewisdom.io. This is kind of tracking the trending stocks on Reddit for the past 24 hours. You can see we get ups, we get mentions, and we get the tickers. So, I'm going to do like top 15. This is going to be a part of the context.

### 🎯 応用例

And we have Swaggy stocks. This is basically the same uh but there's some more positive or negative or neutral sentiment analysis here. So we have gold beyond uh meet I think AMD, Nvidia, Google, right? Uh okay. So you can see these are going to be in the context here.

### 💭 考察

So I have these two freshly screenshotted from this page and we set up a workflow. Uh so I have like this command here structure. So this is the workflow we do. We go from kind of yeah, you can see we have a step one that's going to review our trending data sources. We have the two images I said, right?

### 📌 まとめ

And we're going to use a bash command to get today's date. So, we kind of have that up to speed. Uh read my account balance that is going to be at $1,000 now, right? And we're going to extract all the tickers from the images we provided up here. And yeah, that's basically it.

### ✅ 結論

But we are going to avoid known mega caps. So like Google, Apple, yeah, Nvidia, like stuff like that because the volatility is pretty low. So there's not a lot of uh you can't make much money on those CFDs because there's there's not so much volatility. So we try to aim for like smaller stocks that have more volatility uh especially these uh meme stocks. Right.

### 📚 追加情報

In our claw.md we also have like you're a professional trader with specialization in CFD trading. Your task is to find trades based on sentimental signals from Reddit, Twitter, other sources. Our strategy is to leverage volatility signals and blah blah blah. It's pretty straightforward. So, we have some strategies here we're going to follow.

### 🔖 補足

If people are interested in this, I can do another uh go through of this, right? But basically, uh this is kind of our simple setup. Uh we have our MCP servers. So, if we head over to cloned, right? And we do our MCP.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Yeah, there are some there are a couple of servers here like the computer use we're not going to use. So we going to use our grock or X server. We're going to use our Reddit server. The tools here are uh search post, find trending post, search by handles. And for the Reddit server, we have the tools that is going to be find post, get comments and we can search for post and the finance Yahoo finance tools are get quotes and get the quote with a scraper just because we need a real time um or pre-market quote um ticker values too.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Uh yeah, those are the MCP servers we're going to use. So basically I think we are ready to run this now. So I guess we can clear this and all we have to do is just do our slash cfd command. So this is going to start our workflow now. So the first thing that's going to happen now is just that uh we're going to do the workflow we had in our command.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So we're going to read those images. We're going to read our account balance, right? And everything. We're going to check out the date. And yeah, uh the reason I picked clo for this is just it's so good at doing like parallel tool calls as you can see here.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And just the tool calling is just world class. It's the best tool calling from all LLMs. And that's why I want to use this. So you can see what happened here. We had a look at the images and we filtered out some.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So basically we filtered the small cap u uh small midcap tickers. So we have beyond me asset entities dragonfly energies am okay. uh Open Door, SoFi, Nebius. Okay. And then we use the Yahoo Finance.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, we're going to look at uh we use a headless puppeteer here to screenshot each ticker so we can get the pre-market and the closed market price for all the tickers we are interested in. And from there, we're just going to keep doing research. Okay. So, after some back and forward, we kind of ended up on two trades uh we are going to do or that I did. Uh we ended up with uh Beyond Meat and we're going to do a 5x leverage.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Uh I'm not going to do $2,000 exposure on this because uh uh I I need to transfer some more money. But basically, we are starting with $800. And I'm going to do an entry here for 1.9. And on the Sophie, uh we're going to do the 2.5 leverage. We're going to do the entry at 29.9, I think.

### 📝 セクション 20

Right. And we have some tables. We're going to follow the TR take profit tables. But more importantly, the stop-loss levels, right? So, we're going to do if we enter beyond meat, we're going to do 1.8 and 27.5.

### 💡 セクション 21

And then we're just going to have to wait and see what these trades give us. So, uh I'm going to screen record my phone. I'm going to show you the trades we have done so far. Okay. So, you can see this is the soi trade we did.

### 🔧 セクション 22

You can see we did a 29.98 opening price here. And if you look at the stop loss, we're going to do 27.5. And the takerit is just going to be as high as it gets. I guess for the Beyond Meat, this is at 2 uh if you go to Beyond Meat, 2.08. Now, we're going to do uh an entry price I think at 1.9 if we go down there.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Uh so that is basically the strategy. I think it's a very simple setup and I think it's just a good start just trying to start to explore with this. We have like $1,000. It's not insane, but we're going to look at the percentages I guess and just to see what we can do with some small leverage. Uh I'm going to build a hyperlquid one too where we can do uh I think we can they have a documentation and an API I think so we can do a bit more and set up maybe some more autonomous trading because this is very manual.

### 💭 セクション 24

It's uh yeah, basically based on anal sentiment. So, I'm going to do a hyperlquid one and I'm going to try to make it into a series. So, I do like a Monday, maybe like an update uh before the week starts and then I'm going to do like on Friday now after five trading days. I'm going to do like a recap how we did during the full week because it doesn't take long to set up the trades and close them out when we want to. So, I'm probably going to do a hyperlquid one uh for cryptocurrency and I'm going to continue with this uh CFD uh trading agents here with the setup we have.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, this is an iteration process. So, I'm going to try to improve it over time, see what work, but doesn't maybe have some more specific strategies we need. So, yeah, hope you will enjoy this series and let's see if we can make any money. Um, I did make $50 last week when I tried it out, but that was I think was just bit basically luck. Uh, and I think this is probably going to be a bit of a luck, too.

### ✅ セクション 26

But, uh, maybe we find something. Let's see. So, yeah. Thank you for tuning in. Hope you come back on Friday and have a great week.
