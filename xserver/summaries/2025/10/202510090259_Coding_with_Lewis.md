### 🎬 導入

A huge trend in the world of programming right now is the TUI. A terminal user interface is a software with its primary functionality/implementation whatever happening in the terminal. But uh but why? So think of this for a second. Okay, adding a guey to any application automatically adds a ton of overhead and can be like so slow.

### 📋 背景・概要

However, Jira 2UI strips all of that away and puts it into a terminal. It's literally only text. So, the only lag is probably the latency through the API. And of course, how can we forget about cloud code? It's exploded in popularity even to non-developers.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

But seriously though, the terminal is intimidating only visual really like for you know 10 minutes. So 2IS might take off like crazy for speed and efficiency if the terminal in general takes off. Some libraries you can use to build them are textual if you're using Python, bubble tea if you're using Go, Ratatouille in Rust. Honestly, that that that's a goat name and recently open for TypeScript. Has anyone named one Hawktui?

### 📝 詳細説明

The future of software might be more minimal. What's your thoughts? Just let me know.
