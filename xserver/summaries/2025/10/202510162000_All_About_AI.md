## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So now I can just uh go and start. Yeah, you can see we have some here. I can go to my slides. Perfect. And then I can move on to the second slide.

### 📋 背景・概要

I can talk about this. I can play the video. It's engineering Sam. >> H that is complicated. Can you reframe the question please?

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

I was thinking about the Sor 3 app. >> Yeah. One of the questions I get asked the most is kind of how do you actually use AI? let's say in your company or just daytoday. So, uh today I just wanted to make a video uh just an example of how I use it and how I save time, how I create what I think personally is, uh a very good output and my creativity and kind of what you can do if you know how to use these tools.

### 📝 詳細説明

So I wanted to do like a simple example where I kind of take you from let's say this is my in my business like my company this is like a standard request you can get sometimes so this could be like something I get this offer we would like to invite you to do a session on context engineering for our company IT department only audience we get the offer like it's going to be a 60-minute talk plus a Q&A when I think about this I like to think about it like I want everyone on there to remember this uh session. I want to try to make it as highly engageable as possible or engaging I guess and I want to make it uh uh optimized for the people that is there. So I have some ideas how we can actually use AI to optimize for this as you will see soon. So let me just take you through kind of my workflow, how I think about this and how you can not exactly do what I'm going to do today, but you can take some tips from this and turn it into what you can do. So let's just start with the obvious thing.

### 💡 実例・デモ

The obvious thing we need to do is gather context, right? On context engineering. What is context engineering and how can we use this? I have my own experience that I'm also going to add in. Uh but let's say I wanted to grab some more information online here.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So uh let's say I went to YouTube. I found this video here. I've seen this before. It's very good. Advanced content engineering for agent, right?

### 🎯 応用例

What I want to do now is I want to grab this video. I want to turn this into text for my uh my talk uh that we can do some derivative uh yeah information gathering from this talk. Right? So an easy way to do this is use some kind of code. Right?

### 💭 考察

And let's say we head over to claude. I want to start with uh I know there's like a YouTube DLP Python we can do to get v YouTube uh videos uh and turn them into audio files. So I'm just going to start that and my ID here is I want to use the open AI API that's going to take a speech that could be an MP3 file into text. Right? So I'm just going to copy this documentation here from OpenAI and save the OpenAI context here.

### 📌 まとめ

Okay. So let's check back on claw now. It's ready to write my code. So hopefully now this can take any URL, right? So I'm just going to copy the link, right?

### ✅ 結論

Let's test it on this URL. Okay. Okay. So it says downloading complete. So let's go to cursor now.

### 📚 追加情報

And yeah, you can see here we have um 14 minute audio file here. >> Hi everybody. Uh my name is Dex. >> Okay, so this is me from the editing. For some reason, I lost my audio here.

### 🔖 補足

But basically, what I went ahead and did now, I used the speechtoext model from OpenAI. I turned that MP3 file we created into text by using the speech to text model. I guess it's whisper in the API. And after that uh to get some more context, I just wrote down uh what I think context engineering is a bit about my idea how you can gather context around if you want to build some projects. and I end up with two files we can now use to build out our uh presentation.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So yeah, that was just a quick recap of what I did here. Okay, so let's just drop uh our context file here and let's do the same with my context, right? And let's do a prompt here in chat GPT GP5. Uh the prompt I'm going to do is not nothing advanced. It's pretty simple.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So I'm giving a presentation on context engineering. I uploaded the context for my research. For my slides, I want talking points in chronologically order, short bullet points for each topic. Let's define five main topics. Also create mermaid diagrams to explain flows related to context engineering and other important relevant relevant maybe things for my presentation.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So this is kind of my starting point. I'm going to send this to GP5 and then I'm going to evaluate and iterate. Okay. So here you can kind of see uh an example of the result we get. You can see what is context engineering designing what the model sees not just a prompt collect shape in order info to guide LM better input context better output why it matters improve quality and reduces errors.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Yeah, I think this is fine, right? So, how to use it? Do and don'ts. Uh, and we got the mermaid chart. I copied this mermaid chart and I put it into claw because uh I wanted this into an artifact because I'm going to show you kind of trick we can do with this.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Okay, so this is kind of what we ended up with. We have like a Yeah, you can see this mermaid chart. We have this uh inject run lm check path and we can go back if we don't want to. Uh, but I want to what I want to use this for is something I can show you. So, I'm just going to screenshot this.

### 📋 セクション 18

You can pick any model. I'm I'm going to use nano banana. So, here we have our flowchart. So, now I'm going to do a prompt here to try to make this uh kind of fit our um style. So what I went ahead and did if you remember uh when we got the kind of the assignment here this is an IT department and they have some AI experience.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So I always like to do my presentations in like a team, right? So, I decided this time to do like a Windows 95 team because it people usually have some kind of nostalgia to that type of uh teams. Okay. So, I know I said Windows 95. What I meant was Windows XP uh not 95.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, I think this is fine. Here you can see we kind of get this uh yeah uh yeah, we get the classic background. So, I think I'm just going to use this. Is this perfect? No.

### 💡 セクション 21

But it's a bit more fun than just this uh yeah boring stuff here. Right. Uh next I want to do some video. So I'm going to show you how I use kind of Sora just to light up uh keep the engagement a bit going right under my presentation. So here we're just going to use the prompt uh interviewer asks uh what is context engineering Sam uh at Sama in his office at OpenAI answers right awkward laughs uh confused handheld camera.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, while we wait for that, we're going to start working on kind of my um presentation. So, I'm just going to grab the information we're going to use here. Uh here I have a presentation domarkdown. I'm just going to paste in that. We want to make this a Windows XP theme.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, for that, uh we're going to create a website. So, I'm going to clear the context here in Claude and I'm going to give it a prompt. Okay. So, I lost my recording there, but I said I'm making a presentation on context engineering. I tagged presentation.mmd.

### 💭 セクション 24

I have prepared five slides with talking points. It should be another cell stack holded web page because I completely stopped using PowerPoint presentations. Uh I just use web pages now. It's so easy to create with the uh agents like cloud code. The theme of the page is Windows XP.

### 📌 セクション 25

I have an image we uh we can use. So that is of course the famous uh yeah background here. And I want the presentation to start with me clicking on the start menu, finding context engineering and launching to slide one. Let's start with this and iterate more later. So I put the cloud into plan mode and it came up with a plan here.

### ✅ セクション 26

Right. So we just going to uh do yes execute on the plan. Okay. So we have gone through a few iterations here and I think it looks pretty good now. So let's head over here.

### 📚 セクション 27

Let's do uh npm rundev. And let's open up this locally. And here you can see this is our starting point. We have kind of the classic windows. Maybe we should add some kind of title here.

### 🔖 セクション 28

I think let's just do on the homepage create a title overlay on the background. Context engineering new line my name new line date center center. I want to see if that works. But let's take a look. Now you can see we have the clock right?

### 🎨 セクション 29

We have the start menu. So here you can see here's kind of my menu. Okay. So we got the context engineering here. That's pretty good.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh now I can launch this by clicking on this. And here we can see this is kind of exactly we have this window, right? We can close that down. I guess we can't do that. But we can't uh we can take a look at the slide.

### ⚡ セクション 31

This kind of looks like a Windows XP, right? Uh it's not perfect, but it's this is just kind of my yeah start. We have slide two, three, four, and five. And we also have kind of the show notes. We can take a look at them.

### 🌟 セクション 32

We can zoom in. The presentation is just so much more engaging and you don't have to spend a lot of time on this. I have created like a bunch of Sam Alman videos here. Uh I'm going to put into the presentation and when we kind of have the final version of this, we're going to watch some of the videos and see if that also kind of elevates the engagement of the slides. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So the next step now is going to be to actually put this on GitHub so we can use Versel to actually launch this because I have one more thing. If you remember the request was a Q&A and I have something I always use in my presentations or talks that is engaging for the audience too that I'm going to show you kind of a simple way to do uh at least if you have Versel set up like I do. Right. So we're going to push this uh web page into the repo. So if we refresh here now, you can see uh we have all the code here.

### 📋 セクション 34

Perfect. I'm just going to try to deploy it. See if we have any build errors. We might have that. Okay, that was no problem.

### ⭐ セクション 35

You can see we deploy this. We got the domain AI press- steel versus app. Uh it's not the most interesting uh URL, but here it is. So here's my presentation. It's deployed.

### 📝 セクション 36

I can access this from anywhere. I can open up here. I can see my slides. Right, perfect. So yeah, no issues here.

### 💡 セクション 37

And this means it doesn't matter. I can bring my Mac. I can just use any kind of computer on the site where the presentation is going to be. So yeah, deploying this has a lot of advantages. But next, now we're going to do something else.

### 🔧 セクション 38

We're going to go back here. We're going to go to storage. And I created a database for my projects because if you remember, we have a Q&A session here. So what I'm going to do now is something super easy that brings the engagement of the presentation what I think at least uh way up. Okay.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So what I went ahead and did now I said I created a database for the presentation and this database should be able to take questions from the audience on a page/QA. Create a simple form to submit questions that would be displayed on slide five or after slide five. Call it questions. Pick five random from the DB. So the idea here is now we are asking cloud code to create a plan for this and we're just going to execute this plan and hopefully now we have like a Q&A system the audience can engage with throughout the presentation.

### 💭 セクション 40

Check it out. Now if I refresh here and let's do okay submit question. Let's try that. So let me do something like uh what is the best aentic AI model? Okay.

### 📌 セクション 41

Uh let's do Chris. Uh let's try this out. Submit. Okay. So that was successfully submitted.

### ✅ セクション 42

So how could we check this now? I guess if we go here and we go to context engineering. Let's go to the last slide. Loading questions. What is the best agentic AI model?

### 📚 セクション 43

So this is something I use in my presentations uh because now we can take we can just put up the URL in the beginning so the people can go to this page and under the presentation they can just submit questions I can read at the end here. Uh but I want to do one more thing. So let's do after each slide do something. So what I want is after each slide here uh I want a question right? So I can get some engagement from the audience.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So, I'm just going to do uh I want to have a simple quiz about the AI. After each slide, uh show the quiz. Let the audience go to the page/quiz and vote for what they think is the correct answer. Display the votes in real time. Create an AI quiz question between each slide.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Uh and use the DB and quiz page uh to collection for votes. Now, I'm just going to show you kind of how that worked before I embed all the videos. And let's take a look at the final thing here. So let's say I go to my presentation and finish talking about slide one. Uh let's go to slide two now.

### 🚀 セクション 46

And you can see here is a quiz now. What is the primary goal of context engineering? And we have like four options here people can look up. So if I go to my yeah you can see my phone here. I can go to this uh yeah quiz slide one and I can vote to increase model size.

### ⚡ セクション 47

I'm going to submit my vote and you can see in real time this updates. So this is pretty fun when you're doing a presentation and it's really engaging for the audience instead of just sitting there. So this is fun. Now we're just going to do the videos for each slide just for some banter and then I think we are done. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So now you can see I have all my Sora clips here in my public folder. Just going to try to do it simple. So we have five clips in the folder. So I'm just going to tag the public folder. Embed the 916 clip into each slide.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Making sure we can click to open in full screen. So I'm just going to run this in cloud code. Hopefully this get embedded. We can push this to GitHub. Uh deploy on Versel.

### 📋 セクション 50

And let's check it out on our yeah final uh presentation. So now I can just uh go on start. Yeah, you can see we have some here. I can go to my slides. Perfect.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So now we kind of have the slide, right? Uh I'm can I can talk about this. This is kind of my idea. Just my talking points. I can throw my notes if I wanted to.

### 📝 セクション 52

Uh I don't need that. Uh we have the video. So now we can kind of tease the video and I guess we could play it at the end of the slide before we move on. So let's just do that. >> An example of good context for an LLM.

### 💡 セクション 53

>> Okay. So you get the point, right? So we have some videos and uh when I'm done with my first slide, I can go to my yeah question for my quiz. What is the primary goal of context engineering? I can guide the audience to the page we just had where they can vote for the quiz if I wanted to include this and then I can move on to the second slide.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Uh I can talk about this. I can play the video. >> It's engineering Sam >> H that is complicated. Can you reframe the question please? I was thinking about the Sora 3 app.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Yeah. And here I have some more videos, some more things to talk about. Okay. So just to sum this up uh I just want to be quick but basically this way of working using these tools has given me a lot of great feedback to be honest and uh customize each presentation for the audience I have been talking to has been yeah I would say just very successful and like I said the feedback and people say I asked people when where did you find out about me right and they say ah we heard it from someone that was listening to you talking about having a presentation And a lot of people enjoy kind of the engagement. So this is the questions I do, right?

### 💭 セクション 56

If you look at the ending here, I guess I didn't show that now, but if you go all the way to the end, I have the questions and we of course have the quiz here in between. People can attend to uh sometimes is a bit of a hassle, but people really like it. And uh it's keep kind of the it keeps the audience engaged throughout the whole hour if that's what you're going to do. So you can apply that to a bunch of other things uh whatever you do. So this was more like a general workflow but uh yeah hope you can take something away from this and start uh using these tools to yeah level up what you do.

### 📌 セクション 57

So yeah, thank you for tuning in. Have a great day and I'll see you again soon. And by the way, you can find the presentation in the link in the description below if you want to check it out. I'm going to keep it up for a while. So yeah, have a great
