## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Building AI agents just got 10 times easier. It now takes 2 minutes to create an agent. And this is thanks to the new workflow builder from NA10. My name is David Andre and over the past 3 years, I've built hundreds of different AI agents. In this video, I'll show you how to use the workflow builder to automate any repetitive or boring task in your life.

### 📋 背景・概要

We will build three AI agents, each one progressively more powerful than the last, with the goal of pushing the workflow builder to its limits. Real quick, we're building an office in Warsaw, Poland. So, if you want to work with me, then fill out the link below the video. All right, so let's jump into NA10. And if you've never used NA10 before, this is the simplest way to build AI agents, especially with the latest update.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, you can see there's a brand new button right here. So, if you click on build with AI, this sidebar slides in. You can also open a sidebar by clicking this button, NA10 AI. Now, to be honest, this opens a completely new era of building AI agents because you can literally now use AI to build AI agents and automations. It's crazy.

### 📝 詳細説明

Okay, let me let me just show you. So, I'm going to send a prompt. Here's a very simple automation that in the past you could build in 10 minutes, but now NA10 will build it for you in less than a minute. So, if you're wondering, David, is OpenI going to replace NA10? The answer is no, because NA10 is fully focused on automations while OpenAI is doing all kinds of stuff.

### 💡 実例・デモ

There we go. So, you can see this was like 20 seconds and we can There it is. The agent is built. NA10 is cooking. This is the biggest NA10 update of all time, guys.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Pay attention because in this video I'm going to show you everything you need to know about the workflow builder and how you can use it to completely transform your business or your personal life. So just like that from a single prompt in 30 40 seconds we have a complete agent with zero errors. Pretty amazing if you ask me. So let's look at what it did. First the assistant searched through available notes.

### 🎯 応用例

So it has complete access to an NA10 documentation. So it knows all of the nodes and all of the different connectors that work and exist inside of NA10. Then it added the necessary nodes. You can see that the NA10 assistant added them, but they were not connected, right? They were just like scrambled across the canvas.

### 💭 考察

But that's what the next step is for, connecting nodes. It ordered them and connected them properly the way I wanted them to be. And lastly, and maybe this is the most important step, it updated the node parameters. So, if we click inside of each node, you can see it already has my credentials filled in, guys. This is insane.

### 📌 まとめ

This really is like NA10 2.0. This is the biggest update of all time. If you're not building AI agents, you really are falling behind because it has gotten easier than ever before. And there's literally tens of millions of businesses in this world that still don't use any AI. The opportunity is enormous.

### ✅ 結論

And you can see even the system prompt. Wow. The model is selected. Gmail is prefilled. My own job is getting automated.

### 📚 追加情報

This is crazy. So let's actually take a look at it. There's this button execute and refine. We can do that. And let's see if we run into any errors.

### 🔖 補足

It will tell us what to do and how to test it. Seems like no errors so far. That's that zero errors. Workflow executed successfully. Let me load in my email.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Did this actually work on the first try? That's that's insane. So here is my actual email. So it created a draft. Okay, that's already amazing.

### 🚀 セクション 14

But it's empty. So it didn't get the content. So let's look at that. And here is the issues. Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So all I'm going to do is I'm going to just spread this apart and delete these incorrect variables. So I'm going to drag in the correct snippet. Save it. Remember to save any changes in NA10. And I'm going to rerun this.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay, this time we got error in the Gmail tool. So let's look at that. And actually instead of fixing that myself, let's just ask the assistant. So, I'm going to say fix the error in the Gmail tool. Boom.

### 🎬 セクション 17

The error occurred because the AI was generating a placeholder sender email address. Okay, we can actually probably click this. We should probably just manually drag in the person that sent the email. And we're going to run it again. Does it work now?

### 📋 セクション 18

All right, no errors this time. Let me check the drafts. Wow, it actually works. Thank you for reaching out to check out my YouTube channel. I appreciate honest observation.

### ⭐ セクション 19

I mean, I don't know what to say. 3 months ago, this would have taken 10, 15 minutes to build, right? If you're a beginner NA10, maybe 30 minutes. Now, it was like 1 minute and I just fixed one error. But if you think this is amazing, just wait until you see the other two agents.

### 📝 セクション 20

Also, I haven't even shown you the new modes inside of the NA10 AI. We're going to get to that in a second. First, I'm going to answer the most common question you guys ask me on every NA10 video, and that is, David, where do you host your AI agents? And the answer is simple. Every single AI agent me or my team builds is hosted on Hostinger.

### 💡 セクション 21

And that's because putting your agents on Hostinger gives you unlimited workflows and unlimited concurrent executions. So, you literally own the virtual private server. You can do anything with it. And now, thanks to the Black Friday deal, it's like $65 to get your own virtual private server. If you go with the one year or two plan, you know how I said that it's the best time to get into AI agents thanks to the new NA10 AI assistant that literally builds the whole automation for you.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Well, guess what? This Black Friday deal from Hostinger really confirms that this is the best time to get in, especially if you go with the 24 month plan because you're going to be saving 64%. And if you use the code David, Hostinger will give you another 10% off on top of the 64. And as I said, setting this up is actually very easy. Let me show you.

### 🎯 セクション 23

First off, to visit the Hostinger site, click the link below the video. Now, Hostinger offers many different VPS plans, but I think the KVN2 one is perfect for most of you, and it's also the one me and my team use internally. So, click on choose plan, and this will redirect you to the checkout here. Select the period. I recommend going 24 months because when you build your agents, you want them to be running forever.

### 💭 セクション 24

Plus, you get a really, really solid deal when you go with the 24-month plan. You even get a free domain for a year as a bonus. And since Hostinger was kind enough to sponsor this video, if you click on have coupon code and type in David, you will get another 10% off of your plan. Next, we need to select the location of our server. So, just select whatever is the closest to you.

### 📌 セクション 25

I'm going to go with France. And then we need to select the operating system. Now, since we're building AI agents in NA10, obviously we're going to select NA10 right here. And then what remains is finishing the checkout. So, click on continue.

### ✅ セクション 26

Next, we need to create an account. And this takes 20 seconds. Super simple. Now, after you sign up, you get redirected to the billing page where you fill out your name and your billing details and complete the purchase of your VPS. And once you complete the purchase, you will find your VPS server right here in your hosting your panel.

### 📚 セクション 27

And you can see it's already running. So, click on manage. And here you can see all the details about your virtual private server, CPU usage, memory, outgoing traffic. This is literally enough to run hundreds of AI agents. But what we need to do is we need to click on manage app.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And this will bring you to your NA10 server when you can manage all of your AI agents. So, if you're serious about building AI agents, make sure to check out Hostinger. Use the link below the video. It really is the simplest way to host your AI agents. Now, back to NA10.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Now, admittedly, the first agent was pretty simple. So, now let's build a more sophisticated, more powerful agent. So, let's go to the top left and click on plus to create a new workflow. There we go. Here's an empty workflow.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Now, if you look into the top right, you'll see that there's two modes in the NA10 AI. The ask mode, which if you use cursor or cloth code, is the same idea. This one doesn't make changes to your actual automation, right? So you can understand like maybe how to change something. It can help you explain documentation, but it cannot do stuff.

### ⚡ セクション 31

But then there's the build mode. This is like the agent mode that can make changes. So the build mode is the actual powerful one. However, there's one shortcoming, and that is the 1,000 character limit you can input in this field. So if your prompt is very long, sooner or later you will hit the limit.

### 🌟 セクション 32

There we go. You've reached 1,000 character limit. And to be honest, a lot of my prompts are well beyond 1,000 characters. So, let me show you a workar around to get around this 1,000 character limit. I'm going to use vectal to split the build idea into separate chunks.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And we're going to build the AI agent one note at a time. Plus, another benefit of this approach is that we can use any of the latest and greatest models inside of vectal. While in NA10, they don't really tell us which model this is powered by. So, if you want to use the greatest model from Entropic, for example, sonet 4.5, you can do that. Now what this agent does is that it analyzes your calendar every single day.

### 📋 セクション 34

How much time you spent working, what did you work on, how productive were you, and then gives you a concise report. And here we have detailed instructions for the first node, which will be a daily trigger. And it even gave me the prompt for NA10 agent. So let me copy this, switch back to NA10. Boom.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And I'm going to have it built one by one. So this is a simple solution to the 1,00 character limit because obviously this is a very short and optimized prompt. And there we go. Since it was a simple note, this took like 10 seconds. And now I can screenshot the output of the NA10 agent.

### 📝 セクション 36

Boom. Copy that. Paste that into vectors chat agent and say done. Let's go to the next node. So let's copy the prompt for the N10 AI again.

### 💡 セクション 37

Send that. So now it's going to do a set node. And this node needs to set two variables. Okay. So it added the node and now to connect it.

### 🔧 セクション 38

There it is. Nice. And you can see that it's working. These diagonal dashes indicate that the AI is working. And there it is.

### 🎯 セクション 39

node has been connected and actually I really like this approach because instead of trying to oneshot everything which can go wrong and then you can get stuck in what's called debugging hell where you have many errors in dozens of different nodes especially if you build complex agents this approach of building it one node at a time I think this is going to be the approach that people take because it will really allow the NA10 AI to focus on getting the node right instead of it getting overwhelmed with like doing 8 10 12 different nodes at once. Okay. So once again I'm going to screenshot the results of the N10 agent and tell that to vectal. Done. It also give us the expected results so we can see what the automation should look like to check it at any point of the building.

### 💭 セクション 40

So let's see. We have the daily 6 p.m. trigger correct. And let's see if this is set correctly. It is.

### 📌 セクション 41

Wow. N10 AI is not bad actually. All right. Let's see the instructions for node 3. This is the get today's calendar event.

### ✅ セクション 42

So Google calendar. So, this one will be more complex, but I think the NA10 AI can get it. It needs to do get many. Look at this step-by-step process, man. The engineering behind this is really clean.

### 📚 セクション 43

NA10 really cooked with this one. This is like the most demanded feature probably. We have an error though. Parameter calendar required. Okay.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So, I just need to select the calendar. Oh, and another thing that comes with this update, which by the way, this update is rolling out, so you might not have it if you're watching this the day this video was uploaded, but it's getting released this week, so everyone will have this. and Nathan was just kind enough to give us early access. So, shout out to Max and Dylan. Anyways, another big thing is the credentials were improved.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So, if you click on create new credential, signing with Google used to be very complicated, but luckily now they went through the costly Google audit of the entire codebase and now it's literally just one button. I'm going to have to blur it out, but basically you select your account, the one that you want, and then you select all to give it access. Continue and connection is successful. No more Google Cloud Console, no more credential, client ID, O of none of that. We just connected the account like that and boom, the account is connected.

### 🚀 セクション 46

It never has been easier to build agents, guys. If you still haven't gotten into agents, what are you waiting for? It's now like so easy. Amazing, man. I'm going to save this.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Boom. I'm going to pull up the AI again and we're going to run the Okay, the button disappeared. Well, whatever. I'm I'm just going to let Vectton know that it's completed. We're going to get to the next step.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Boom. Paste it in. Done. All right. This is going to be more complex.

### 🎬 セクション 49

This is the code node and vectal even gives the JavaScript code. Okay. So, this is the benefit of using Sonet 4.5. And actually, this is the benefit of having all of the latest greatest models in a single chatboard is that you can switch to the best model for code, right? So, Enthropic is specializing for software engineering and code while OpenAI is more like a friendly chatbot, whatever.

### 📋 セクション 50

Or you can just use open source models like GLM 4.6. But what I'm trying to say is that you can use Solid 4.5 in vectal to generate the best possible JavaScript you can and then you can use the NA10 AI to build the actual automation. But basically, you're using the best of both worlds, right? The NA10 AI knows the NA10 documentation. That's what it's best at.

### ⭐ セクション 51

But it's probably not the best coding model. Let's be honest. However, Sonet 4.5 is. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy the prompt for the agent. But then I'm going to copy the code that vector gave us and I'm going to trust this code over the code that N10 AI generates because again we have no idea what model this is using.

### 📝 セクション 52

Realistically it's probably some cheap model. Could be GBD4.1. I don't know. N hasn't revealed that. But I'm just going to use the greatest model from Enthropic Sony 4.5 to maximize the odds of our automation working.

### 💡 セクション 53

So let's check it out. Transform events. We have some code here. But I'm going to replace this. And also you can see like this is bloated 42 lines.

### 🔧 セクション 54

The soneted one is 31. So much cleaner. Anyways, we might need to actually borrow items as input.all. This part was good from NA10 AI, but the rest I'm going to trust solid 4.5 with. So let's save this and let's move on to the next step.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Let's actually run this. Let's look at the output here. Return. So it should be a JSON of events and it does seem to be that way. Note five, analyze calendar and generate report.

### 💭 セクション 56

So here we're going to be using an AI agent node. Boom. Now this could be any um model. So I'm going to change it to agent. Doesn't have to be open AI.

### 📌 セクション 57

Could be Enthropic, could be Gemini, whatever. But yeah, open AI is the most powerful. Um, after all, they're the first mover advantage and they're absolutely crushing that deal with Broadcom was crazy. 200 billion in a day. If you haven't made 200 billion in a day, you're falling behind because Broadcom did, man.

### ✅ セクション 58

I need to secure one of these open deals for Vectoral. All right, so here's the agent and now it's connecting it. Boom. This is like magical watching this. It's crazy.

### 📚 セクション 59

Really the main value that a human gives is the idea is the initiative the creative vision because all of the repetitive and manual tasks will be done by AI and this is not some sci-fi 20 years from now I'm talking like 6 to 12 months from now guys you really need to brace up okay so let's see what model is using GBD40 that's fine but I prefer 4.1 4.1 is just uh amazing for AI agents is reliable It's cheap. Um, yeah, use 4.1. Boom. Let me save that. Okay, save.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Now, this should generate the report from the event. So, let's look at the prompt here. So, as you can see, the N810 AI brought both the system prompt and the user prompt, which is pretty amazing. And yeah, seems to be seems to be solid. I mean, JSON stringify is using Let's close this.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Sometimes sometimes it's better to close the AI assistant to have more space. We need to check the code node and yeah, we do need to output the final events here. Okay, so actually I'm going to do a bit of manual context engineering. I'm going to do events and then events after that. XML tags are really great at showing the agent where something ends and where something begins.

### 🚀 セクション 62

I'm just going to paste in the whole events JSON and I think it can probably handle these objects inside. Yeah, I think it can handle that. So, let's save that and let's see what happens. Let's rerun the whole workflow. Maybe I should tell it to make the report concise because it's running uh too long here.

### ⚡ セクション 63

But let's see. All right, here's the HTML. It's actually pretty concise. Okay, use professional HTML formatting. I'll say make the report concise just at the end.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Never hurts. Save that. So I'm going to screenshot our whole automation here. Boom. Back to vectal.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Paste it in. This is important to provide all the context. I'm also going to screenshot the last N8 AI output. Say here is the current state. What remains?

### 📋 セクション 66

It even suggested to add the temperature and max tokens. Let me check that if anything did that. No. Let's follow Vector's suggestion. 0.3 and 4,000 max tokens.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Okay. Okay, that's actually I didn't even expect to have it suggest that. That will also prevent it from being overly long and the temperature will make it more deterministic, right? If you do like zero, it is completely deterministic. If you do one, it is uh very random and unpredictable.

### 📝 セクション 68

So that's a very very impressive thing that it's suggested actually. Okay, note six, send report via Gmail. So this is the final step basically and yeah so I'm going to copy the prompt again for NA10 AI paste it in boom but as you can see another issue is that you only get like limited amount of monthly credits it's a pretty generous amount to be honest but yeah you pro you probably cannot use this as your main chatting agent that's for sure okay so send report email boom connected to the flow there we go and now it's configuring the details of Let's see if if it automatically selects the email as well, the credentials because that's something that beginners used to struggle with in the past in any 10 selecting the right credentials and stuff. Let's see what happened. It did connect my email.

### 💡 セクション 69

Wow, that's pretty crazy. Sub. Okay, two workflow. Okay, so this we need to change like this. We can manually se select where we want to see that email, right?

### 🔧 セクション 70

I'm just going to manually type in my email. No big deal. Subject. That's good. Custom date and then message.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Generate report. First JSON output. Yeah, that looks correct. I mean, this is very impressive, guys. NA10 really did a great job.

### 💭 セクション 72

Uh, yeah, this takes it to the next level. I think I think this is like turns NA this will make NA10 available to the masses. I think we're going to see a renaissance of AI automations. But now the whole thing is ready. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to rerun it again.

### 📌 セクション 73

The whole workflow at once. Let me close this so we can make this a bit bigger. Right, we have the AI agent generating report. And I'm going to load up my email. Okay, it's actually faster.

### ✅ セクション 74

I can even work here. We should be receiving an email. And there we go. I just received an email from me myself and I anyways 15th of October 2025 daily character report and here is the report and the problem is it's empty. It should put yesterday's events.

### 📚 セクション 75

Hm. What's the issue here? Let's investigate. Let's look at the agent. Did the agent mess up?

### 🔖 セクション 76

Okay, whatever. What I'm going to do, I'm going to copy this and I'm going to help use vector to help me make sense of this. I'm going to do JSON. Boom. JSON help me understand what's in this JSON output.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Does it correctly include all events from yesterday or not? Because uh here it's missing all calendar events, attendees. Yeah, this this doesn't look good. This looks empty. What's in the JSON?

### 🚀 セクション 78

The HTML report is completely empty. So, let's investigate. We're going to actually tell this to an NA10 AI. Okay, shift enter doesn't work. That is a pet peeve of mine.

### ⚡ セクション 79

NA10, please. Shift enter should move you to the next line, not send the message. So, yeah. Anyways, I'm just going to copy this part. That should be less than thousand characters.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Yes, it is. Again, this is still in beta, so you know, it's not perfect and it's not optimized to be a chatbot. It's a workflow builder. But yeah, so the problem is our AI agent is not receiving the right data. So maybe that did get the data.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Could be the code note is messed up. The issue was that JSON events was outputting object object instead of actual data. JSON stringify. Okay. Uh where did the Gmail why did it remove the Gmail node?

### 📋 セクション 82

Okay. Wait, that's crazy. Add back the Gmail node. Okay. that I've never seen that happen before, but okay.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Do do not run this probably on workflows that are already super complex, super important. This is just like vibe coding. This is really the best at creating going zero from zero to one, right? Creating something out of nothing. If you already have a complex workflow, I would be very careful.

### 📝 セクション 84

I would much rather do the setup where Vector gives you tells you what to do rather than letting the N810 AI mess up something that already works. But at building something from scratch, this is amazing, right? And let's rerun the whole workflow. So, I'm going to execute the workflow. Boom.

### 💡 セクション 85

This is still very slow. Maybe we can use GBD 4.1 for this. Well, I mean 4.1 mini. You know, 4.1 is um maybe overkill even. Yeah, that is suspiciously slow.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Okay. Well, invalid email address. How is that even possible? Oh, it overwrote that, of course. Okay, let's execute just this step.

### 🎯 セクション 87

And let's see if this is correct or not. Okay, so new email came in. Look at this. Daily calendar report. Same title, but we have things total events 16.

### 💭 セクション 88

Average duration 3 hours. Yeah, this is correct. I do track my time every 15 minutes, by the way. So, we will have to blur some of this because these are private events. But yeah, it sent me a detailed analysis on my calendar.

### 📌 セクション 89

It's pretty OP actually, not going to lie. And then it gives you duration, attendees, what type it is, if it's a meeting, personal. Wow. Analysis of every single event in the calendar. This is pretty damn good, guys.

### ✅ セクション 90

This is pretty damn good. And we built this in not not that much time, right? We did it note by note so I could explain everything. And yeah, this is only the second agent. Now, let's move on to the most powerful and most complex agent of the three.

### 📚 セクション 91

And actually, this one I'm going to try to oneshot it. This will really push the NA10 workflow builder to its limit. So, I have a prompt. Hopefully, this doesn't go beyond 1,000 characters. It does.

### 🔖 セクション 92

This is 1,03 characters. Okay, we can trim it. Boom. Let's save one character here. Remove the dot.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Remove the dot. 1,000 characters. There we go. Let's see. Still, we reached the limit.

### 🚀 セクション 94

What? That makes no sense. Unless this site is incorrect, which I would be very surprised because I've been using this site for years. How is this is this counting like some hidden system prompt policy check? Okay, this is Okay, it's not counting correctly.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Okay, I'm going to delete some details. Boom. Let's try again. There we go. Yeah, they really need to limit remove that limit.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Okay, at least make it 4,000. Like 1,000 is too low. But again, it's in beta. So, I think N10 is probably going to watch this and listen to my feedback. Hopefully, if someone from N10 is watching, I just want to say this is amazing.

### 🎬 セクション 97

You know, even though I was critical at times, like very impressive beta version and this will definitely put NA10 in a leak of its own. This is not like agent kit, make.com, zapier are not even comparable now. So this agent basically what it does is it's a long into short form factory. So it takes a latest video from my YouTube or any YouTube channel and it will create and publish multiple shorts with uh AB testing. And honestly I am not sure if it can build that.

### 📋 セクション 98

Look at that. Wow. We have like 25 nodes here. This is crazy. I really don't know if anything is going to nail that in a single thing.

### ⭐ セクション 99

in a single execution. But man, even if it can get this get us 80% of the way there, like this is still completely revolutionary, right? This doesn't have to do every single thing. It just has to save you time for it to be useful. Wow.

### 📝 セクション 100

There it is, guys. This is like a onehour build. I don't think you understand what you're looking at right now. Just assembling that would have taken like 20 30 minutes. If you're an experienced NA10 flowgrammer, if you don't know what you're doing, this could have taken you hours.

### 💡 セクション 101

But now you just describe the automation you want to build in plain English and you let the NA10 AI cook. I really don't know what to say. This is crazy. In some ways, this feels like, you know, being vindicated or being correct when I was preaching about AI agents in 2023 when nobody cared. Now we're seeing things actually work.

### 🔧 セクション 102

We're seeing the revolution finally happen. And still most people aren't paying attention. So yeah, some people you will just never wake them up. But hopefully if you're watching all the way here, you do understand that the future is here and there's no time to waste. Okay, so we have some steps and this is really cool.

### 🎯 セクション 103

I guess we haven't done this in before. When N10 AI cannot do something like you know get API key or log into your account, it will tell you the steps to do, right? So this is like the agent plus human. This is the human in the loop. A lot of people think the future is either fully human, you know, the ladites, the people who are anti- AI or like the super evangelical like AGI in 6 months dummies.

### 💭 セクション 104

They think that humans are useless. This is not the case guys. Minimum the next five to seven years it's going to be human plus AI. Humans and agents working together. Humans will be driving the ideas and driving the vision, the taste.

### 📌 セクション 105

agents will be doing all the manual work such as clicking and dragging nodes and you know establishing all that which is what you just saw N10 AI do in like 90 seconds and then we just have to do the stuff we cannot do you know but look this is already a very solid outline and the best part is if you want to change anything you can just prompt your way into existence right now I'm running out of time so I do have to wrap up here but guys hopefully you see the potential of this this is crazy has this is the biggest N10 up I know I've said this like three times But like NA10 AI the workflow builder is it's the next era. It really is a 2.0 era of NA10. And if you still if you like the difference is that maybe in the past you're like ah this process doesn't really waste that much time in our business. You know maybe automating it would save like a couple minutes a week. It's not really worth it me spending an hour two hours inside of an A10 building automation.

### ✅ セクション 106

Well guess what? Now it isn't an hour or two hours inside of an A10. Now it's like 5 to 10 minutes. So now it will pay to it will pay off for individuals and businesses to automate all of the inefficiencies in their business. Doesn't matter how small it is.

### 📚 セクション 107

If it only saves you two minutes a month, guess what? You can just have one or two prompts into N10 AI and you can have a whole workflow in those two minutes. So yeah, this is really really powerful and hopefully you guys see that and if I had to leave you off with one piece of advice is go and start building start automating the repair process in your life processes all of the boring stuff because if you don't you simply won't be able to keep up with people that do you know 12 months from now it will really be the difference between people who have a bunch of AI agents and AI automations saving them hours and hours every single day and people who didn't autom autoate anything and it doesn't matter how long you work, how much you work, what is your intelligence, you cannot out compete AI. You cannot beat a guy who has, you know, thousands of different API calls happening automatically every day in his life. You simply can't because technology always wins.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Technology is the ultimate leverage. So go ahead, use the inspiration, use the energy you have right now. Go into anything and start testing this out. just the friction is in the first one or two agents. As long as you can muster up the energy to push through the first two agents, you've defeated 90% of the battle because everything after that is so much easier.

### 🎨 セクション 109

So go and start building workflows with the new workflow builder inside of any. And also don't forget to take advantage of the insane Black Friday sale at Hostinger. Once again, thank you Hostinger for sponsoring this video. And yeah, with that being said, thank you guys for watching and I wish you a wonderful productive week. See you.
