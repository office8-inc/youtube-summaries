## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

If you don't use cloth, you're falling behind because Enthropic just released Sonet 4.5, Cloth Code 2.0, a new agent SDK, browser use, and so much more. My name is David Andre, and I'm the founder of Vector.ai. Over the last 3 years, I've spent hundreds of hours building software with AI. And in this video, we'll look at the new cloth updates, how sonet 4.5 compares to GPD5, and how you can build anything with it. So, Cloth is having its own CHBD moment, and that's because Enthropic just released Sonnet 4.5, which in many ways is the best model in the world.

### 📋 背景・概要

It's exactly five times cheaper than Opus 4.1, which was already incredible, while beating it on nearly every benchmark. Now, since Sonet 4.5 released, I've spent more than 20 hours testing it, building with it, and comparing it to other cuttingedge models. And I must say, this model is different. For example, on the famous SWEBench verified benchmark for software engineering, it's better than everything else in the world right now. Both without reasoning and with reasoning enabled.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Oh yeah, and if that wasn't enough, Enthropic also dropped cloth code 2.0 with several major upgrades such as checkpoints, which is a way to go back and access a previous state of the conversation. A new revamped terminal interface with a cool mascot, context editing, ID extension. There is a lot. Okay, cloth code has improved massively and that's because this is by far the biggest CL code update ever and you'll see why I think that in a bit. All right, so when I say that cloth is becoming better than CHBT, let me show you what I mean.

### 📝 詳細説明

So here I have prepared a prompt for a simple app, create a JavaScript app where text explodes into particles that respond to mouse movement with options for different physics like magnetism, propulsion, or orbital motion. And you can see that Sonet 4.5 is already way way faster than Opus 4.1. And that's because it's a smaller model while at the same time being a more powerful intelligent model. And boom, just like that, in a matter of 20 seconds, we have our app finished. So, let's open this up and let me see.

### 💡 実例・デモ

This is insane. All right, let's try a repulsion. This is incredible. And this was done in a single prompt, one shot, no corrections, no errors. It's safe to say this model is amazing at programming.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Now, I think you might start to understand what I mean by saying cloth is underrated. Also, you can now create and edit sheets. documents, slides, and PDFs directly inside of Cloud AI. It's funny because most people are still not using Cloud. They're using CIGPD.

### 🎯 応用例

But even those that are using Cloud, the vast majority of them have no idea that these features and connectors even exist, let alone how to use them. So, let me show you how to set this up because it's actually much simpler and easier than you think. All right, so let's jump back into Cloud. Just create a new chat and then click on this settings button right here. This will open up different search options, right?

### 💭 考察

such as extended thinking definitely have this enabled but then also we can connect Google Drive, Gmail and calendar. And as you can see I have Google Drive already enabled. If you don't have anything connected just choose one of them, click on connect. Go through the steps. Super easy.

### 📌 まとめ

Takes like 20 seconds. Once you do that, reload the site and then you should be able to see Google Drive or Gmail calendar connected. Just toggle it on. And then let me show you how powerful this is. You can send a prompt something like this.

### ✅ 結論

Which video ideas is my team working on? List out the five most recent Google Docs. Right? And there we Oh, the search has finished and we have five Google Docs that it pulled up and yeah, those are actually the five most recent video ideas that we worked on and this one is the video you're watching right now. Now, Cloth also became much much better at VIP coding.

### 📚 追加情報

In fact, this might be VIP coding 2.0 because Enthropic just released Cloth imagine and this is a completely new way of building software. The app you describe is generated on the go. So you don't need to wait for hundreds of lines of code to be written and then hope that they compile without any errors. No, that's VIP coding 1.0. This clude imagine works on pre-built components.

### 🔖 補足

So it's basically like its own operating system in a way where it can generate custom UI in real time. So to test it out, go to claw.ai/imagine. Not everybody has access, so keep that in mind. All right, so let's give it a shot. Click on let's go and you can see basically like a mini operating system gets loaded.

### 🎨 セクション 13

We can move stuff around. So, let me show you one of these presets. And you chat with cloth and it generates stuff, but it generates it procedurally. It's not like it has to write a thousand line program. See, like it's generating it one by one.

### 🚀 セクション 14

It's like adding a component and you can already interact with the other ones. As you explore the app, it's built in real time. This is completely different than any other vibe coding tool. So, like let's see like for example this guild quest, right? I click on that and clone begins generating the UI for that.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And as I'm trying to see like what I like, what interests me, it goes with that direction. It's like completely different level of creative exploration. A map with 10 points of hidden treasures. Now, the obvious downside of this is that it's not reproducible software and it's basically generating tokens for everything, even stuff that should just be a few lines of Python. So, you can see the tools that it's calling.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Window new creates a new window. And now it's drawing some SVG components creating a map based on my description. This is very very cool. Now if you really want to understand cloth 4.5 set you have to learn about this new concept of context anxiety. So this is a new term coined by the article from cognition AI the creators of Devon where they discuss their experience with sonet 4.5 because they were granted early access.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Now this model cla 4.5 sonnet is the first model in the history of AI that is actually aware of its context window. So what that means it knows how many tokens it used up and how much is left and this completely changes how it behaves. So for example, as it gets closer to its context limit, it starts to summarize its progress, which is good to save up some tokens, but also it starts to develop this context anxiety, which is basically a tendency to rush tasks into completion. If it thinks like, oh no, I only have 15% of the context window left. It doesn't do proper job.

### 📋 セクション 18

Instead, it tries to kind of pack it up quickly and finish whatever it's doing, even if that means taking some shortcuts. Now, here's a visualization of how the context editing works. So before context editing you have some tokens from tool use from the tool results maybe some chatting conversation another tool use stuff like that. This is what the context window might look like. After context editing it compacts the oldest one.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Here is the current state. This is your last message on the right and this is the oldest stuff in the conversation. Right? So whatever you send at the very beginning is probably the least relevant. So it's compacted into the true essentials.

### 📝 セクション 20

And then as you keep progressing towards your latest messages, you can see that there's more available context because the oldest parts of the conversations have been compressed. Now, as if all of that wasn't enough, there is another major release and that is computer use which might be one of the most exciting parts actually because AI agents are starting to use our browsers. So, Enthropic also released a browser extension, official cloud browser extension, which basically lets clo control your browser, you know, no big deal. Another massive update that most people aren't paying attention of and this is a major hit to companies like Perplexity who are building products like Comet or DIA browser because these AI powered browsers have several massive issues such as privacy. Right?

### 💡 セクション 21

I was using Comet for a solid like 2 3 weeks until I did some deep research into how much data it collects on you. And this is basically spyware. It's building digital profiles of every single click, every single search, every single thing you hover over, every single website you visit, even like your mouse patterns, right? And it's trying to build a digital avatar so that then it can run ads. The issue is me and you, we want to be on the cutting edge.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And this is exactly where the cloth extension comes into place. You can still use privacy first browsers like Brave and use AI agents with browser use on top of that without selling your data and selling your soul. So, let me show you what this cloth browser extension can actually do. Now, this is still a pilot program, and what that means is that they only give access to 1,000 users with the Max plan. Now, luckily, I am one of those 10,000 people, so I can access the extension, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, if you want to try, if you're in those 10,000 people, just go to cloth.ai/chrome and see if you can install the extension. If you can, you're going to get redirected to this website where you can try a demo of how the computer use agent works. So, again, it's in the top right. open it up and you'll be required to log in to your Claude account. Okay, so just click on authorize and then let's click on this plus icon which presends this prompt.

### 💭 セクション 24

It's kind of small and as you can see this orange outline means that Claude is taking control of this browser window. So it's asking me for a permission to read the page content. So I'm going to allow this action. So then it's taking a screenshot of this page. Okay.

### 📌 セクション 25

So it can see the email inbox with several emails I can identify and it's completing this demo. So this is a challenge, right? So you can see how it operates, how it can read the website, how it can take actions. It's asking for permission again. And we can actually click on always allow actions on this side.

### ✅ セクション 26

So let's allow that. And let's watch cloth take control. Like my my hands are off the keyboard, right? I'm not doing anything. Boom.

### 📚 セクション 27

There it is. So it's clicking archive. It's archiving one of the emails. Took a screenshot again. Then it read the page.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So it read the HTML DOM to find the exact buttons. And then it found refct button. And it clicked the button. And we can see that it's managing this, you know, email inbox demo. Now, what's even better than a demo of email inbox is if it can actually manage your real inbox.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, let's give it a shot. Let's open up the extension. You can see that there's something predefined for Gmail such as unsubscribe from promotional email, archive non-important emails, drive response for emails. So, let me do something custom. I'm going to switch it to act without asking, which kind of gives this warning mode.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You can see this yellow lines. I'm going to say archive all the declined emails about people declining Google Meet calls. Do not change anything else, you know, just to be sure because this is still a pilot program. It's basically earlier than a beta version, right? So, I don't want it to start messing around sending emails from my actual email inbox or archiving important stuff.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, now it's uh searching for declined. Okay, it's actually working pretty fast. It's impressive. So now it filtered to emails where people declined Google Meet calls. Now it's selecting all of them.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe not all of them, you know. Maybe not all of them. So I stopped it. I'm going to say maybe not all.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Just archive the latest five. Yeah, I'm going to do smiley face to kind of encourage it. You know, good that I noticed that. Okay, it's going again. Nothing is selected now.

### 📋 セクション 34

Nice. Now it's going one by one. So as you can see, it's still needs a bit of the instruction, but it can actually do all the actions. It's not struggling with clicking buttons or with understanding. It completely knows what you want it to do.

### ⭐ セクション 35

You just need to do a little bit of handholding and be very clear in your prompts and it will do exactly what you want. And it skipped those emails that didn't fit the criteria. Wow, this is pretty crazy. It's trying to give it a label, which is not the right way to do it. There is a archive button.

### 📝 セクション 36

Okay. Oh, it noticed that I actually opened label button. Let me close this. Pressed escape to close it. Let's see if it can find the archive button correctly.

### 💡 セクション 37

It found the archive button. And there it is. Five conversations were archived. All done. Now again, if you are a low IQ person, you might think, "Okay, David, but you had to interfere.

### 🔧 セクション 38

You had to be very specific in your prompts." Guys, this is still early days. Use a bit of your imagination and see where this will be 6 months from now, 12 months from now, where these AI agents will be able to navigate every single website. Basically, better than the average knowledge worker at a company with remarkable consistency and reliability. Right now, what you just saw is the level one of this extension. The second level is actually this super small settings button in the top right.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And when you open that, you click and click on shortcuts. This is why you should subscribe to this channel because I actually show you all of this hidden stuff that nobody else covers, right? So if you aren't subscribed, go below, click the subscribe button. It's completely free and you will not miss the cutting edge AI updates. So here you can click on create shortcut and basically this is like a mini automation.

### 💭 セクション 40

This is a slash command. You could say archive useless emails and then the prompt would be open Gmail and look through the latest unread messages and anything that's obviously useless or low leverage just archive it right away and obviously you should ideally spend more time on the prompt but this will do for now and then start from you can give it the starting URL so I can just paste in Gmail boom maybe without the search and then the beauty here is that you can run it on a schedule so let's say you do daily 9:00 a.m. and it will just manage your email inbox every day and out. Whatever you want it to do, you can now automate it to run daily or weekly, monthly, annually, maybe like check for birthdays or something. Like there's a lot, right?

### 📌 セクション 41

You can you can get creative and you can figure out how this browser use agent could be useful. But again, this is just scratching the surface of what it can do. And honestly, this will probably require its whole video to explore this fully. So, if you want me to make a full dedicated video on the cloth chrome extension, comment below. And if I see a lot of people commenting, maybe I'll consider making another video on this.

### ✅ セクション 42

Now, if you're a developer, you will be very interested in this because Entropic is giving us a agent SDK. And what that means is the behind the scenes of cloud code. So, this is a collection of tools that helps developers build AI agents. And not only that, it actually helps you build AI agents the same way they are building CL code. So, it's the same infrastructure that powers cloud code, which is very, very nice.

### 📚 セクション 43

You know, Infropic is releasing a lot of these secrets. Now, it's not fully open source, but the fact that you can still use the same tools and frameworks that work behind the scenes of what makes CL code great, it's very nice. So, let me give you a quick overview of this powerful framework, which again, most content creators ignored for some reason. Maybe they're just scared of programming. I don't know.

### 🔖 セクション 44

First part is the AI agents manual. They found that giving clude access to computer aka computer use unlocks the ability to build way more efficient agents, right? So, here are some examples on the right. finance, personal assistant agents, customer support, no matter what you want to build, giving it access to the right tools and the right environments is absolutely key. Now, behind the scenes, cloud code operates in a feedback loop.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So, it gathers context, takes an action, verifies the work that you know the action actually did what you want it to do, and then it repeats. And this is basically the four-step loop that keeps running behind the scenes in when you're using cloud code, when you're chatting with it. And Enthropic didn't hold back. They give us specific suggestions on how this SDK can improve each one of these steps. So step one is gathering context.

### 🚀 セクション 46

When developing an agent, it needs to be able to fetch and update its own context, right? Because if it doesn't have enough information, even if it's using a 300 IQ AGI model, if it doesn't have the right info, if it doesn't have the context of how you want it to do the task, it will not be able to do the task. Now, the SDK organizes information using folders and files, making it easy for the agent to find what it needs. And if you actually work with cloud code, you'll find that the best way to manage context is actually saving the imported stuff externally right into markdown files, text files, documentation, visual graphs, not just only relying on the context window. And when reading context, especially when it's large files, it only loads the relevant parts instead of everything at once.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So imagine if you have a very long file, you know, five 500 lines of code, 1,000 lines. Ideally, you know, you would have a more modular codebase, but let's be honest, sometimes it happens to all of us where we have super long files. Well, your first instinct, and I made this mistake in the past myself, would be to load the entire file into cloud code. The issue with that is context overload, right? It's just too much stuff at once and most of it is not relevant.

### 🌟 セクション 48

A much better approach, and if you actually watch how cloud code works, you'll see that it does this, is only loading the relevant parts, right? So when there's a bug on line 75, instead of reading all 400 lines of the file, it reads maybe the 20 lines before and 20 lines after so that it tries to figure out why the back is happening. And it only reads more lines of code if it didn't get enough context from those nearby lines. So it's much more intelligent system of managing context. It also automatically summarizes past conversations to keep important information available without running out of space.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And we've seen a visualization of that earlier. Step number two is taking action. This is all about tools, right? AI agents use tools to take actions which could be like a single function or a series of functions to do a specific thing. And this absolutely is essential for completing tasks because if you just have AI agent running locally on your machine with no tools, no APIs, it cannot do anything even if it's the most powerful model in existence.

### 📋 セクション 50

Now these tools should be focused. You shouldn't give it random tools because those are also distractions. They should be tools designed to what you want the agent to do. So if it's like a email responding agent, it should be open Gmail, read email, write a draft email, anything related to managing your email, right? You shouldn't be giving it the calculator tool.

### ⭐ セクション 51

You shouldn't be giving it, I don't know, Python backend debugging tool. It's useless. If it's an email management agent that you're building, give it tools to manage email. Step number three is verifying the work. Right?

### 📝 セクション 52

This is a a step that most people skip because it's not sexy. It's kind of boring. But if you want to build reliable agents that actually work in production, it is absolutely essential. With the agent SDK, you can add checks to make sure things are correct, right? So if it writes some code, run a test.

### 💡 セクション 53

If it writes an email, take a screenshot, make sure the email is actually there. Same thing for visual task like building front end HTML. It can take screenshots. It can check its work. It can read the DOM.

### 🔧 セクション 54

There is a lot of different verifying steps it can do to make sure that the action or let's say it's you you're working with database, right? And you told it to write an entry into the DB before continuing. it can just do another tool call but this time doing a read query checking if the table has been modified and if the new row was added to the database. Now the agent performing these checks is absolutely the difference between reliable consistent agents that can be trusted and deployed into real businesses to automate important work and between AI agents that are just like what you see on YouTube lot of these creators you know vibe code something but no real company would ever use that and this is the difference you know using serious frameworks using serious testing unit tests verification monitoring telemetry all of this stuff that you only learn when you go deep you know when you spend spend hundreds of hours if not thousands of hours building software. This is not what you learn with a quick VIP coding demo from a 5minute tutorial.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And I suspect this is the reason why most people completely missed the agent SDK release and why they don't realize the implications of this. So here is the plan. Next, I'll show you the new Cloud Code 2.0 and how it compares to Codex with the new GPD5 Codex High model from OpenAI. We'll also go over the strengths and weaknesses of the new Solid 4.5 model, plus my own lessons and observations from testing it non-stop for four straight days. And I'll show you how you can use this new LLM to build great software.

### 💭 セクション 56

So, let's get started. All right. So, open up your code editor of choice. Doesn't matter which IDE you use. So, I use cursor also use code or you can use wind surf.

### 📌 セクション 57

Doesn't matter. Just open up an empty folder. The reason why it doesn't matter is because you can use cloth code in the terminal. Now, this is Codex. We don't we don't want to be using Codex.

### ✅ セクション 58

We want to be using the terminal and type cloth, right? If you don't have cloth code installed, what are you doing? Go ahead and install it. Um, I made dozens of videos on it because it's amazing. But yeah, this is the terminal version, right?

### 📚 セクション 59

So, you're probably familiar with this if you watch my channel. And you can see that there is new UI. So, we have this mascot, you know, the crab. And uh we can see that we're using Sonet 4.5, the new model. You can see that we're on the cloth code 2.0 version and we have some tips.

### 🔖 セクション 60

But other than that, this is the familiar terminal interface, but there is a second way to use cloth code now. And that is the extension. So if you go to tensions, boom, and it's named cloth code for VS Code. Literally type in that cloth code for VS Code from Enthropic. I don't know why it has reviews.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So that's kind of I think you need a Microsoft account. Open VFX registry. Yeah, you need some crazy account for this. Uh, I don't know. People are hating on it for no reason.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Download this. Okay, set this up. You'll see this button right here. When you click this, it opens up the extension. Okay, and this is what it looks like.

### ⚡ セクション 63

It's basically the same capability but with a different UI. So, here you can do shift enter, which is great because uh in the terminal, shift enter doesn't work. It just sends the message. Never mind, it works now. Maybe I'm just crazy, but literally this didn't work for forever.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So, now it works again. Amazing. Uh, anyways, this is just a different UI, right? So, here you can paste an images easier. You can chat with it.

### 🎬 セクション 65

It's another way of using cloud code. Now, I'm going to just tell you the secret right away. I'm going to cut the The way to use it is with Codex. So, if someone says like, "Oh, David, is it better than Codex or should I use Cloudcore or Codex?" The answer is both. They both have completely different strengths.

### 📋 セクション 66

Okay? There's not a single answer. Like, if you just want a single answer like I don't know, just like these people like, "Oh, what's the secret? What's the one thing I can do to get into shape?" What do you mean one thing? You have to do like 10 different things to be in great shape.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Well, what's the one thing I can do to build a successful business? Be quiet. Okay. So, you need to use all of the best tools at your disposal, right? So, you can see I'm using Cursor, which is the best AI coding IDE.

### 📝 セクション 68

Inside of Cursor, I'm using the two best coding agents, which is Cloud Code and Codeex, right? And both of them, I'm using them in the extension and in the CLI. So, here we have the cloth code. Let me kill it terminal. Boom.

### 💡 セクション 69

Cloth. Right? This is how you use it in the CLI which is command line interface by the way which is the terminal. Here's how you use codeex in the CLI which you should do parameter- search and then you need to allow it right. So we have codex running gbt5 codex high which is the best model from openai in the terminal.

### 🔧 セクション 70

We have it running in the extension which by the way you install it the same open cordex you install it exactly the same as any other extension inside of VS code. So we have Codex extension, we have Codex CLI, we have cloud code CLI, cloth code extension. This is literally how I work. I'm using all of the best AI agents at my disposal in a way where they are the best. Right?

### 🎯 セクション 71

So let's get practical. How is clo code better than Codex? In what ways would I use each of them? Right? The the best way to explain it is that cloth is nicer to work with.

### 💭 セクション 72

So if if I say like uh create a new MD file named vision MD, it will do exactly what you want and it will do it quickly and it's great explaining fakes and stuff like that, right? The way to explain it is like cloth code is a friendly co-orker that you just love to see. You have a great rapport with that co-orker. You you are friends together. You love chatting with him and it's a great person.

### 📌 セクション 73

You know, it's a competent co-orker. Codex is like the person who sits in the room. He's kind of antisocial. He he doesn't really like anybody, doesn't talk to anybody, but he's a genius programmer and everybody knows it. This is the difference between Codex and Cloud Code.

### ✅ セクション 74

Codex, especially with GBD5 high selected, which is the main model you should be using, is really good. It's really insanely good. I mean, it's crazy, right? Uh but sometimes it just takes 10 minutes to do the dumbest thing, something that clo can do in one minute. Sometimes it has a tendency to overthink, right?

### 📚 セクション 75

which is good if you're doing a risky change. If you're refactoring an essential part of the codebase or do or fixing like a very deep bug that you that you've been battling it for many hours, you wanted to prepare. You wanted to overprepare. You wanted to do a lot of thinking to spend 10, 15, 20 minutes preparing, analyzing the codebase, using as many tools as possible before it takes any actions. you wanted to do that but sometimes you want quick changes quick safe changes of the front end some tweaks this is where cloud codes come into place now obviously you can select GBT5 low which thinks less on average you know lower reasoning effort but still even on low and medium codec still has a tendency to overthink so that's why I'm saying like you really should use both and you should know when to deploy each model and when each AI agent is struggle and where are his strengths and weaknesses if you want to be at cutting edge at the top 0.01% 01% of AI programming because I want to make a clear distinction right there is vibe coders people who use tools like lovable vzero replet uh bold who just like type in stuff or like speak you know please build me an app that looks like Shopify but it's actually for uh Uber drivers and it's like Airbnb clone and do not make any mistakes those are vibe coders right and there is nothing wrong starting as a vibe coder but the goal of every vibe coder should be to become a real coder.

### 🔖 セクション 76

This is the difference between people who will be stuck and endlessly in a mediocrity and people who will achieve greatness. Is are you afraid to get your hands dirty, right? Will you forever be afraid of code or will you learn the fundamentals so that you can move 10 times faster? Because let me get something straight. Even though even though AI is becoming great at programming, I'm spending one to two hours per day studying software architecture, software design, programming, manually coding without AI.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Why? Because I recognize that if you really want to get the most out of these models, you have to get the most out of this model, the OG neural network that's in your head. If you haven't maximized, which by the way, nobody has maximized. If you haven't maximized your own skill set and your own potential and your own technical abilities. Oh my god, it's actually building this slope.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Okay, that's crazy. I didn't wanted to build that app. Let me just delete this. Actually, I'm going to get started on the app I want to build. So, before I go on the other rant, let me just get it started.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So, I want to build a new algorithm that came to me as I was struggling to fall asleep. This algorithm is for optimizing time to first token for AI models, right? So we will be using enthropic API with the new cloth 4.5 sonet model and obviously there's a certain delay between the first token comes into place and this is constant and consistent for everybody that uses the enforopic API. However, I had an idea how to build a chat application that actually has a faster time to first token and that is going to be thanks to preloading. So we're going to be looking at how the user is typing inputs.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Right? So what I need you to do is build a very simple front end. Choose the simplest text stack possible, right? Just Python back end and JavaScript front end. Let's keep it super simple.

And it's going to be a clean, minimal chat application powered by anthropic API. And the main differentiator with the this algorithm for optimizing time to first token is that we're going to be paying attention to the typing patterns of the user. And if the user stops typing for more than 700 milliseconds or longer, we're going to silently send the message on the back end to the enthropic API. So that if the user then actually sends the message without adding any extra characters, we would have already began processing that request and therefore we can cut down the perceived time to first token versus if we actually waited for the user to press enter. Now it's important that if the user continues typing, we abort or abandon that previous API call and we repeat the process again looking at the cadence of his inputs and the delays between these characters.

### 📋 セクション 82

I just gave you a lot of, you know, ideas, a lot of direction for my vision for this program. Your task is to organize these thoughts into a clear plan into this vision MD documentation file. Do not write any code yet. just help me organize my thoughts and help me plan this out. Think harder, be concise.

### ⭐ セクション 83

All right, so I just spent a solid two, three minutes speaking what I want to build. And again, this is the difference between noobs and beginners that build absolute slope with AI and people who can build real production applications like me because I've built a startup that is doing over $10,000 a month in monthly recuring revenue and we have over 65,000 people who've used it. vector and it's running in production and I'm using AI to build it. Yeah, it's it's hundreds of thousands of lines of code and it works and it's improving every single day. And this is the difference between people like me who can build real software with it.

### 📝 セクション 84

And by the way, I'm no I'm not like a you know I I know that sounded super egotistical, but I know I'm like level one out of 100 levels when it comes to building a software company, right? That's why I'm reading all these books and that's why I'm learning like crazy because I recognize that I know nothing. But still I have been able to build and deploy a real software application that is used by tens of thousands of people versus these vibe coders that build shitty software complete slope that nobody uses. Even they themselves don't use it because they don't even describe what they want to build. They don't take even just two or three minutes to sit down and really think through what are you trying to build?

### 💡 セクション 85

What is the thing I'm building? How should it work? How should it feel? Is it a web application? Is it a script?

### 🔧 セクション 86

Is it a mobile app? Is it a extension? Just put in some effort guys. Put in some preparation. This alone will make your apps and make your experience with AI five times 10 times better.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Anyways, we have this markdown file and we can see that it's now better organized. We can see we have the core key algorithm uh user experience flow technical stack and um yeah another thing I'm actually going to do we switch to the browser again load up perplexity and I'm going to do idea should be like project whatever and I'm going to say your task is to look up the enthropic dogs necessary to build this chat application idea give me detailed step-by-step instructions of how to implement this in Python in my back end. So again, I'm using uh the best tools available. So perplexity research is very solid to uh do the job. Right.

### 💭 セクション 88

All right. So we have the DB research results. I'm going to copy that and I'm going to create a new file for this. I'm going to do enthropic docs because we don't want to redoing the same web search over and over and this is essential part of this app. So now I'm going to say follow vision and enthropic docs and actually build this app env.

### 📌 セクション 89

And then here I'm going to add this information. The enthropic API key is stored in the env file named as enthropic API key. Okay. So that uh because uh the coding agents usually cannot access ENV files right you can see this is blocked by get ignore and cloud code cannot read it or cannot change it for security reasons which is good but we also need to give it like that means we need to give it instructions about how this is structured right so I'm going to add this later doesn't matter here you can actually see the env that's kind of crazy but yeah we're going to launch this launch code get it started and this is just a very first uh very rough version of what this algorithm could look like for optimizing time to first token and the difference is that rather than this and pre-loading websites is that uh there's way lower cost right pre-loading a website doing an API call is kind of expensive but I don't know I was I thought about this and I think something like this will exist maybe in an expensive you know paid application only because for free users this is not feasible at all and maybe only for certain models maybe Gemini free will be very cheap but yeah it doesn't exist yet nobody yet invented this and so I got the idea to build it and I think this is a much cooler project than just yet another vibe coded website that's just an MVP of some front end right this is a novel algorithm that as I said I got the idea to build it as I was falling asleep so it's solving a real problem which is reducing time to first token aka making your experience in a chatbased application faster, smoother, more pleasant. So, we can already see how close code works here.

### ✅ セクション 90

And again, we're using the extension here. Uh we have Codex on the side. We're not using it yet. What I should have done and what I would have done if I was working see like it's much easier to build from scratch, right? Because then you really can use the power of AI and you can execute 50 times faster.

### 📚 セクション 91

If I was building a feature for vectal my startup, I would first create a plan and I can actually feel free to screenshot it and steal it. But basically what I do is I send this and I paste in the plan. So I asked both the models, both codecs and cloud code to analyze all the relevant files and create a simple step-by-step plan for how to best implement this feature, this change, this refactor, whatever I'm doing. I get both of them to implement a plan and then using this prompt I insert it into in between these XML tags and I get the other model to rate the plan of the other model and almost always they agree that the codeex created plan is better. I would say probably 90% of scenarios.

### 🔖 セクション 92

I mean to be honest if I could choose right because I'm using both because both do exist but if I could choose wow it's already finished. Yeah, this more or less great. It's very fast. But to be honest, if I could only choose to have access to one tool, it would be Codex. Even though it's not as good to work with, even though it's not as polished as the plot code interface, it is a more powerful model.

### 🎨 セクション 93

GPD5 Codex High is the best model for coding right now in the world. It makes way less errors. It uh designs a simpler solution. It puts in more work, more reasoning, more preparation, but it's not as pleasant to work with. It uses complex language.

### 🚀 セクション 94

It doesn't explain concepts well. It doesn't format its answers in a re readable way. It often overthinks simple changes that could be like 5 seconds and it takes like minutes analyzing everything. Overthinking. It's not as pleasant to work with, but it is more powerful.

### ⚡ セクション 95

No questions asked. So, let's see. Uh, we have the app finished, I guess. What do we need to do? Start it.

### 🌟 セクション 96

How do I start it? Ping heart and string short. In the meantime, we'll go to the browser. We need to load up anthropic console. All right, let's log in.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Okay, next up, go to the top right. Click on create key. I'm going to go with effect AI and I'm going to do a test video. Boom. Copy key.

### 📋 セクション 98

Do not share your API keys with anybody. Treat them as passwords. I'm going to delete my key before uploading this video. Okay. So, I'm going to paste it into ENV file.

### ⭐ セクション 99

I'm going to save it and then let's see what needs to happen. We have the ENV. Okay. We need to install requirements. So, let me do that.

### 📝 セクション 100

Condv list activate testing the pip install requirements txt clear. And then what do we need to do? Python m server. This is Python server. Python server.

### 💡 セクション 101

Pro tip. If you're using the terminal, you can just press tab, right? So, I type in SE and it already knows I'm want to go server. So, you don't need to finish the whole thing. Just press tab inside of a terminal.

### 🔧 セクション 102

It's actually a very OP thing to do. Okay. So, we have an error. So, I'm going to screenshot it. I'm going to send it back.

### 🎯 セクション 103

I'm going to say the app does not start. Error XML tax. Paste in the terminal output. Error. think harder and implement a clean and minimal fix.

### 💭 セクション 104

And then I'm going to use codex new chat. What does it want to do? Well, okay, whatever. So, we have this. I'm going to say test send.

### 📌 セクション 105

Doesn't send. Oh, yeah. I was accessing the websocket. That's a lame mistake. However, wait, why is the websocket disconnected?

### ✅ セクション 106

Maybe to restart it. I cannot send a message now. Error. Boom. Error.

### 📚 セクション 107

Investigate this and output a concise report. Do not make any changes yet. Just answer in short. Okay. And then I'm going to run the same thing into codex.

### 🔖 セクション 108

And look how much work codex will do. This just answered instantly which maybe it's correct, maybe it's not correct. Right? Sometimes it is good to have a fast answer, but if you want to build serious software, this is very bad practice. Close code just runs rushes into assumptions.

### 🎨 セクション 109

It jumps to conclusions, makes assumptions way too fast. It's not good. One thing I do want to show you though is uh when you do terminal plot, there's a new feature /re where you can restore the composition to previous point. The problem is that you've seen a lot of people talk about this checkpoints. First of all, there's two issues with this.

### 🚀 セクション 110

It was always accessible just by pressing escape, right? So, you could have pressed escape twice and go to the past previous conversations. This was always a feature. So, all the influencers talking about this like this is a new thing. It's not a new thing.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Second of all, learn how to use git. Okay? Just you can ask teach me how to use git. What are the fundamentals of using git to build a startup? What are the essential commands I need to know?

### 🌟 セクション 112

explain what g is and how to use it. Use the AI to teach you. This is the best thing about cloud code and about this model in particular sonet 4.5. As I said, it's much better at writing. So I'm going to say implement a clean and minimal fix.

### 🎬 セクション 113

Both of them basically agree that uh it's a websocket 13 thing. The biggest thing, the best decision you can do is using AI to upscale yourself and clot based models. All of them are much better at teaching and explaining than GPD models. Like you'll see the way Codex types is just um it's not I mean again it's it's fine tuned for code, right? It's GPD5 codex.

### 📋 セクション 114

It's not meant to be a educational conversational model. On the other hand, cloud models are amazing at learning stuff. And this is how you should use it. When you have a bad error, you should reduce technical debt by trying to understand it yourself rather than trying to instantly ask the AI to fix it. Problem with Codex is that it doesn't do a good job explaining it.

### ⭐ セクション 115

It just doesn't write in a in a clean way, in an explanatory conversational way. L code, on the other hand, is excellent at formatting, at explaining, simplifying, summarizing. It's still a great coding model, don't get me wrong, and for certain things, I certainly prefer it. like when I know exactly what to do and it's a safe targeted change, working with cloud code is much better. But if I'm doing something new, something risky, some big refactor, some serious bug, I'm going to definitely trust Codex because it just does way more preparation.

### 📝 セクション 116

That is the truth. But again, the best thing is using both and then copying the plan one of them gives you, feeding it to the other one and asking which plan is better and why. And most of the times both of the models will agree and most of the times they will agree that the correct plan is better. So yeah, this is my current setup and this is what I'm using for four, five, six, seven, sometimes eight, sometimes more hours a day uh to build my startup and to build all kinds of software and u yeah this is a huge update to close code but don't let those influencers tell you like it's some crazy new thing because it's mostly just polishes and you know switch to a proper extension which you can use in uh VS code and VS code forks like cursor and witsurf A lot of people are still scared of the terminal which is a big mistake. If you spend couple of hours learning how basic terminal commands and how to use it and what it is, it's it's not that scary.

### 💡 セクション 117

It's it's not that deep, you know. Anyways, uh let's see. So, we fixed this or I mean Codex fixed it. Could have had Clco fixed it as well. Let me clear this up.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Restart the server. Uh we need to reinstall the requirements. Okay. pip install-requirements txt. Again, I press tab to save time and I'm going to do python server.py.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Reload this. We have the websocket connected at the bottom now. That's beautiful. So, I can say, "Hey, let's see if it responds. We need to see." Okay, so we are getting response from Enthropic API.

### 💭 セクション 120

Who are you? Beautiful. Now, obviously, this is a disgusting UI, but uh I want to see if it does the optimistic pre-loading. So, let me type in something slowly. uh help me understand the git.

### 📌 セクション 121

Then it optimistic pre-loading started. Boom. I didn't even have to. Okay. So, it doesn't work perfectly as I want it to work yet.

### ✅ セクション 122

I don't want it to like display into the UI. I just want us to have it and then only when I hit enter, we would have it. Okay. So, I'm going to describe that, but it's already really good. Already uh achieves the purpose.

### 📚 セクション 123

Okay. So, I fixed the issue. The next problem is that I do not want to show the results in the UI until the user actually presses enter. Right? So again, this should be a silent API call.

### 🔖 セクション 124

It should be optimistically sending it and we should be like saving the output that we get from enthropic API when the user stops typing for more than 700 millconds. However, we should not show it in the chat until the user actually hits enter. And then obviously since it's a anthropic uh model typing ultra think will cause it to spend more tokens on reasoning. So that's another pro tip. But uh you can see that uh we fixed like two small things.

### 🎨 セクション 125

We need a way to clear the chat. So by by when that's happening I'm going to use codex. Uh please update the UI so that it's more minimalistic, clean, and much better designed. This is just way too basic and it's ugly as So make the design look better. and also add a button to clear the conversation and start a completely new chat from scratch.

### 🚀 セクション 126

Analyze all of the relevant files and implement these small changes in a simple and clean way. Don't overthink this. The fewer lines of code, the better. And I'm going to change to medium reasoning effort because I don't want this to be running for 5 minutes. Okay, so cloud code is fixing this.

### ⚡ セクション 127

It should do the optimistic call, but it shouldn't display until I've actually hit enter, right? until the user has hit enter. Uh some people prefer Codex for UI. To be honest, I mostly use CL code for UI. So I don't know people are bad taste, I guess.

### 🌟 セクション 128

But let's see. We say what is git all about? Help me understand git commit. Wait, optimistic preload started. I'm not going to be sending enter.

### 🎬 セクション 129

Reloading. Okay, pre-loading. pre-loading. I'm going to hit enter. Boom.

### 📋 セクション 130

Amazing. Now it works how I want it. Okay. So, basically, if you're typing, I mean, obviously, this is going to burn through cost. This is not a if you are on a limited budget, you cannot build solutions like this.

### ⭐ セクション 131

However, do you see the potential in this? We could change the optimistic pre-loading to be adaptive for each user, right? So it can measure your average VPM words per minute and then like once it notices a slowdown or maybe we can make it like based on a sentence, right? So if there's like a dot word and a dot, it's probably end of a sentence which indicates that the user is probably about to send the prompt and then we can do the pre-loading like that. There is a lot of ways we can optimize this to be more reliable and you know more cost effective but you can already see the potential in this.

### 📝 セクション 132

I mean I can already see the potential in this. I don't know if you guys can see it but yeah this something like this will exist in the future because um you know time to first token is just essentially in a chatting application chatbased AI application and what I just built in a few prompts with sonet 4.5 already is a clear proof of concept where like if you stop typing for a bit and then you hit enter it uh already was saving this on the back end the message was already written But if I continue typing, actually we can test that. Help me understand past API versus Django. Wait, I'm going to have it start. Okay.

### 💡 セクション 133

And we'll say which is better and why. This should kill the previous request. Yes, it didn't do uh it didn't like preload the previous request. It did a new one. That's good.

### 🔧 セクション 134

That's good. Okay, we need to restart the UI, I guess. Let's see. Reload. Oh, we have a nicer new UI.

### 🎯 セクション 135

List out 10 benefits of using Git. Yeah, this is a much cleaner UI. Hey, maybe actually Codex is better at UI than I thought. You know, going to have to test it more. But yeah, this is uh the current workflow.

### 💭 セクション 136

Codeex for risky important actions. Cloud code for fast work where you know you're doing something specific. You it is safe. You know what you're doing and you want to move fast. Clo you want to iterate fast.

### 📌 セクション 137

Close code is the way to go. And especially now with 4.5 solid it's just got a huge power up a huge speed up and it's more cost efficient and you're not going to be reaching limits fast as fast. And really I want to stress it again. The best way to use clot code is for learning all the cloud models like again you should use both right both codeex and clot code but anything you're doing whether it's fixing a bad bug or implementing new feature or extending your codebase refactoring you should seek understanding even if you're using AI agents to move faster which guys I'm I'm like the the person who benefited the most like there's few people who built an entire startup from scratch with AI with less previous experience than me, okay? Whatever.

### ✅ セクション 138

Like, I just benefited insanely from using AI coding, okay? And my productivist speed up was crazy. And I'm still telling you that you should be seeking to understand what it's doing as much as possible. The goal of every vibe coder should be to become a real coder. There is a reason, again, I mean, I know I mentioned this, I'm reading these books.

### 📚 セクション 139

Why? Because I've hit the limits of vibe coding. At a certain point you have to realize I am the limiting factor. You have to see like okay the code base is a mess. It's not modular at all.

### 🔖 セクション 140

It's over complicated. There's too much technical debt. At that point you have to realize okay LLMs are great following instructions. But if you give them bad instructions you're going to get bad results. So use this to obscure yourself.

### 🎨 セクション 141

This is the big biggest differentiator. A lot of people have this mindset of like oh I'm just going to you know use AI models. They're getting they're improving fast right? models are improving fast. Ah, it's there's no point learning this.

### 🚀 セクション 142

In five years, the models will be able to do it. So, what what are you going to do in five years? What are you going to do in the next five years? Just sit around and be mediocre and gain no advantage over others. You have such amazing opportunity to upskill yourself faster than ever before.

### ⚡ セクション 143

If you want to truly get this to your fullest potential, you should become a software developer. You should learn the art of software engineering and the software development. And again, not remembering pointless syntax, but understanding the big picture concepts. Again, if you don't even know how to use git or the terminal, what are you doing? Like, humble yourself and use the AI to learn these complicated concepts, right?

### 🌟 セクション 144

Programming coding can be intimidating if you're new to this. But you can use the AI to explain it in a simple way, right? So you could say, "Explain to me the difference between object-oriented programming and functional programming using simple and plain English as if I knew nothing about software engineering." This is something that was not possible before. Before you could only use Google or YouTube and kind of hope that someone explained it and it's still very slow. With AI, you can learn so much faster than it was ever possible.

### 🎬 セクション 145

And this really is the differentiator. people who will use AI to upskill themselves. I don't care if it's marketing, sales, or if it's programming. Whatever skill you identify is going to take you to your goals, you should be using AI to master that skill and become the best in the world. Obviously, if you're building startups and if you're using AI to build software, it is going to speed you up without a doubt.

### 📋 セクション 146

And the models will keep getting better and the tooling and the AI agent support will get better. All of that is true, but imagine if you yourself also become better at the same time and you have two exponentials compounding on top of each other. Those are the people who are going to absolutely dominate, not the people who just sit around. It's like, yeah, there's no point of learning programming. The models are going to be better programmers than us.

### ⭐ セクション 147

It's like, all right, bro. If that's uh your mindset, then feel free to feel free to just sit around and do nothing. But I would encourage you guys to use these tools to build the future that you want to see. A lot of people are building AI slop. We see this from Meta and Open AI.

### 📝 セクション 148

They're releasing short form AI videos. Disgusting. Disgusting. This is like societal decline. Doesn't benefit society or humanity at all.

### 💡 セクション 149

And I would encourage anyone working those companies to leave and build something meaningful. Build the future you want to see. Use it to solve diseases, to cure important issues, to discover new science, invent new technology, solve mathematical problems, build great software. That's how these models should be used, not for slop, for endless entertainment, like ruining society, you know, or like same with Grock, you know, this like AI girlfriends, disgusting guys. It's just terrible.

### 🔧 セクション 150

So, if you are someone who wants to use these models to build something great, if you're watching this video, you're probably like an ambitious individual that's hardworking, that is above average IQ that pays attention to current trends. Use that power to build something meaningful. Build the future you want to see, not a future full of AI slope. Use these tools to learn how to actually build great software. And if you're going to become a ultra wealthy, ultra successful individual, do it in a way that you can look back when you're 80 and be proud of rather than building these uh dopamine inducing AI slow machines.

### 🎯 セクション 151

So yeah, I I gave you the blueprint. I showed you the path how to do how to fix bugs, how to use these tools is up to you to take action and execute. So with that being said, thank you for watching and have a wonderful productive week.
