## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Half of the internet went offline yesterday. Here's what happened. Amazon Web Services, aka AWS, had an outage in the US East1 region due to DNS issues. More on that in a second. But because everyone relies on AWS to power everything in their applications, everything went down like Snapchat, Fortnite, Reddit, Roblox, Amazon.

### 📋 背景・概要

You know what? Maybe it was a good thing it went down to be honest. Around midnight Pacific time, they started investigating errors with Dynamo DB. And around two hours later, they identified DNS resolution issues causing the errors. It's always DNS.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

It's always DNS. Domain name system is like the internet phone book explaining where everything is on the internet. I type in example.com. My browser then goes to that and knows how to connect to the server. But what happens when that just stops working?

### 📝 詳細説明

Well, it just says nope. Now, imagine billions of nopes. Dynamo DB is a fast NoSQL database that can have many use cases for different companies, but it's very important. Think of it as a main pillar holding up a gigantic bridge. If that falls, most likely it's bringing a lot of things with it.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And this is where sometimes we think that things are too big to fail until it happens. Then you have to realize I have to get my own server. What are your thoughts?
