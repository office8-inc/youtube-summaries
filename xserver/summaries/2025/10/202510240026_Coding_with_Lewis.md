## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

How can one send an email to 100,000 users on a weekly basis in PHP? This includes mail to subscribers using the following providers: AOL, Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo. It is important that all email actually be delivered the the extent that is possible. Obviously, just sending the mail conventionally would do nothing but create problems. Is there a library for PHP that makes this simpler?

### 📋 背景・概要

[Music] Short answer, while it's technically possible to send 100,000 emails each week yourself, the simplest, easiest, and cheapest solution is to outsource this to one of the companies that specialize in it. I did say cheapest. There's no limit to the amount of development time and therefore money that you can sink into this when trying to DIY. Long answer, if you decide that you absolutely want to do this to yourself, prepare for a world of hurt. After all, this is email {slash} e-fail.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Is there any difference in performance between the conditional operator and the assignment operator? I am writing some pre-save hook middleware in Mongoose and I'm wondering if there's much of a speed difference between these two la- blocks of code. Any performance gain is going to be negligible. Those two examples don't do the same thing, you know. You are running this code once before saving a user in the table.

### 📝 詳細説明

This is like wondering if dropping a bucket of water in the Atlantic Ocean will make ships go faster or something. Thanks for the constructive comments. Basically, it doesn't look like there's much of a difference in the performance. For those wondering about the code, first off, I made a blatant error in my original post. Then, when everyone tried to point it out to me, I cried like a girl.

### 💡 実例・デモ

That's probably why everyone downvoted. Remove unnecessary information. Hello, Stack Overflow Land. I am trying to remove only one element from an inline style. I would like to see this instead.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So far, this is what I've tried. [Music] Thanks for your help in advance. Have a great day. Mhm. Okay.

### 🎯 応用例

Um Hello, Stack Overflow Land. Have a great day. Removed greeting and thanks in advance. Roll back to revision three. Roll back to revision four.

### 💭 考察

Let's rephrase all of this. Added 41 characters, edited tags, edited title. Roll back to revision one. Roll back to revision eight. Roll back to revision one.

### 📌 まとめ

[Music] Removal of unnecessary statements, improved formatting, corrected spelling, fixed grammar, removed thanks greeting, roll back to revision eight, closed. [Music] Added two characters in body. How can I change an element's class with JavaScript? No offense, but it's un-clever to change class on the fly as it forces the CSS interpreter to recalculate the visual presentation of the entire web page. The reason is that it's nearly impossible for the CSS interpreter to know if any inheritance or cascading could be changed.

### ✅ 結論

So, the short answer is never ever change class name on the fly. I'm loading an iframe in my HTML page and trying to access the elements within it using JavaScript. But, when I try to execute my code, I get the following error: Security error. Blocked a frame with origin http://example.com from accessing a cross-origin frame. How can I access the elements in the frame?

### 📚 追加情報

Open the start menu, type Windows R or open run, execute the following command: chrome.exe disable web security. Terrible for anything that is not a quick and dirty test and already has been addressed in the accepted answer. Using the clear command on the terminal only fools the user into thinking the screen has been cleared. You can still see output from the previous commands when you scroll using the mouse. This makes life difficult when you're drowning in a tsunami of text.

### 🔖 補足

So, how do you clear the contents of a terminal in Linux for real? Compile this application. [Music] There are better methods than spewing 99 new lines. Is it possible to change the color of the title bar of a WinForm in C#? This is easy to do.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Right click on the desktop and select personalize. Click on the window color tile at the bottom of the screen and just choose your new color. If your computer is configured to use the arrow theme, you can choose from one of the standard colors or mix one of your own. If you're using the classic theme, you'll see a window color and appearance dialog you can use to set colors. Click on the title bar, the sample desktop, the one called active window, and then use color one and color two drop-down boxes to just pick a new color.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I can only assume this is what you meant because there is absolutely no excuse to change only the color of your application's title bar. There's a reason that this is a system-wide setting. Always obey the user's preferences. If they wanted your title bar to be a different color, then they would choose a different color. When a programmer wants to do something, he {slash} she has its reasons.

### ⚡ セクション 15

The answer cannot be there is no excuse to want to do that. The reasons he she it has are wrong or misguided. That is not for you to judge. You are either to help or not help. You can post a comment on this question to tell him your opinion.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Your judgment is not a helpful answer. [Music]
