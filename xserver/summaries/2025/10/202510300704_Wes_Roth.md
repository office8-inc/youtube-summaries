## 💡 概要

この動画は、OpenAIが初めて公開した内部開発ロードマップの衝撃的な内容を解説しています。AI技術の未来に関心のあるビジネスパーソンや研究者を対象に、2026年9月の「自動AI研究インターン」から2028年3月の「完全自動AI研究者」実現までのタイムラインを詳しく紹介します。AI研究そのものがAIによって自動化される「再帰的自己改善」の時代が目前に迫っており、これがAGI（汎用人工知能）からASI（超知能）への急速な移行をもたらす可能性を示唆。人類史における最も重要な転換点の一つとなりうるこの技術進化について、科学的発見の加速化という観点から理解を深められます。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **OpenAIの公式ロードマップ**: 2026年9月に自動AI研究インターン、2028年3月に完全自動AI研究者の実現を目標。異例の透明性で内部計画を公開
- **タスク実行時間の進化**: 現世代のAIモデルは約5時間のタスクを実行可能。データセンター規模の計算資源活用でさらに延長予定
- **再帰的自己改善の転換点**: AI研究がAI自身によって行われるようになると、人間研究者全体を上回る貢献が可能に。知能爆発の引き金となる可能性
- **AGIからASIへの短縮**: 汎用人工知能（AGI）到達後、超知能（ASI）への移行期間が予想以上に短くなる可能性。Leopold Aschenbrennerの理論が現実化
- **Google DeepMindも同様の進展**: AlphaEvolveなど前世代モデルで既に実装済み。データセンター効率化、TPU設計改善、Gemini訓練向上を実現。各社が競争

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

OpenAI did a live stream yesterday talking about in part their recapitalization. They also took some questions from the audience. Most of the questions were about the 40 model. People love that model, but this was what caught my attention. Here's Sam Alman and Yakob Pachokei talking about kind of their internal goals for AI development.

### 📋 背景・概要

As Yakob himself said that they're going to do something that they haven't really done before and that is reveal their internal roadmap. >> AGI rolls around only once subscribe. >> This is a glimpse of where the people at OpenAI, the people at the frontier of AI development, where they think things are going and when they're going to get there. So here we are, October 2025. By September of next year, they believe that we'll have an automated AI research intern.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And then by March 2028, we'll have automated AI research. So, just a quick 10-second recap of why this is important. Imagine that AI doesn't automate anything except for just one thing. That one thing being AI research. So similar to how now we have the world's best and brightest people working on trying to improve AI trying to work out different theories of machine learning and also how to figure out AI alignment making sure that it doesn't do anything bad to us once it's much much smarter than us.

### 📝 詳細説明

So right now most of that is done by people by humans and the progress is going pretty fast. Think about from 2019 to today, 2019, we really didn't have AI as we know it now. The first commercial products with large language models probably started in 2021 or thereabouts. That's when you started hearing about AI writing, etc. And think about where it is now.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So those were humans mostly doing AI research. You could say 100% of this research was done by humans, maybe 99.9. Now certain things coming out of OpenAI out of Google DeepMind like Alpha Evolve Sakus AI the Darwin goal machine and the recent Jurgen Schmidhuber he also had a Huxley goal machine paper that was published him and many other researchers but they seem to imply that we're beginning to see some sort of a progress in recursive self-improving AI if that trend continues eventually it will provide as much contributions as the entire entirey of human researchers and eventually maybe more that kind of leads to that intelligence explosion right so this is automated AI research this is by Leopold Ashen Brener a ex member of open AAI and in theory this will drastically increase the rate of progress so the space in time sort of between AGI and ASI the super intelligence it might not be that long of a time meaning that once we get to a certain point that leap to super intelligence might happen quickly and kind of that inflection point where everything changes well that happens right around automated AI research in theory so going back to open AI's internal roadmap by September of next year we'll have an automated AI research intern kind of like the beginning of that and by the early 2028 we'll have automated AI research there's a lot of AI news happening right now. But this might be the most important piece not just of AI news, but it might be the most important piece of news ever because somewhere here right either at this point or approaching this point, we see that inflection point. We see that explosion in intelligence, AI progress, scientific discovery.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And the reason all these companies are throwing billions and now even in the trillions of dollars towards this stuff is betting on this happening. This is what everyone should be paying attention to. Let's take a listen to a few clips of this live stream. And also keep in mind that Google DeepMine likely has something very similar. The stuff that was published with Alpha Evolve that was from a while ago with the previous generation of models.

### 🎯 応用例

It has been already implemented. It made for much more efficient Google data centers. It improved some of the the hardware designs for their TPUs. It improved some Gemini training. So, it kind of it made itself better, recursively self-improved.

### 💭 考察

We're seeing the results were from a while ago from the previous generation of models. We have no idea what it's producing now. So, it's very likely that somewhere inside of Google, there's a similar road map and it probably also has something like an automated AI research intern or whatever terminology they use and they also have an automated AI research whatever terminology they use for that and it has dates next to it and it might be the same date or it might be a little bit earlier, a little bit later, but chances are it's coming. All right, take a listen. I'm going to hand this over to Yakob to talk about research and as I mentioned uh we're going to share a lot about our internal goals and our picture of where thing where things are.

### 📌 まとめ

At the core we are a research laboratory focused on understanding a technology called deep learning. A particular focus of ours is understanding what happens as you scale up training deep learning systems. One consequence we discuss a lot there is AGI artificial general intelligence. And so in particular we believe uh that it is possible that deep learning systems are less than a decade away from super intelligence systems that are smarter than all of us on a large number of critical axes. There is a lot of implications of this to grapple with.

### ✅ 結論

One particular focusing impact of this technology and the technologies leading up to it and something that we organize our entire research program around is the potential to accelerate scientific discovery to accelerate the development of new technology. We believe that this will be perhaps the most significant long-term impact of AI development and it will fundamentally change the pace of progress on developing new technologies. thinking about how far along we are towards these goals. One good way to think about progress is to look at the time horizon that it would take people to accomplish the task that the models can perform. And so this is something that has been extending rapidly over the past few years.

### 📚 追加情報

Where the current generation of models is at right now is about 5 hours. And we believe that this horizon will continue to extend rapidly. This is in part as a result of algorithmic innovation and a part just scaling deep learning further. If you look at how much time the model's currently spent thinking about problems and if you think about how much compute how much time you would like to spend on problems that really matter such as scientific breakthroughs you should be okay using entire data centers and so there is there is really quite a way to go there. We of course make plans around it internally and we want to provide some transparency around our thinking and so we want to take this maybe somewhat unusual step of sharing our internal goals and goal timelines towards these very powerful systems.

### 🔖 補足

you know this particular dates we absolutely may be quite wrong about them but this is how we currently think this is currently how how how we plan and organize as a research organization that is working on automating research naturally we are thinking about how does this impact our own work and how will AI systems that accelerate development of future AI systems look like how can they empower research like a line and so we are making plans around getting to quite capable AI research interns that can meaningfully accelerate our researchers by expanding a significant amount of compute uh by September of next year. So we believe that is actually quite close and then we look towards getting a system capable of autonomously delivering on larger research projects and a a meaningful fully automated AI researcher by March of 2028. Right.
