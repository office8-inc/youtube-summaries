## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Open EI has launched tons of new stuff that I think shows that the internet as we knew is dying or at least it's no longer what we sort of knew it as. So I'm going to show you a few things that OpenAI is doing. And not just OpenAI, there's other companies that are doing similar things, but this will make it so that in the year 2026, the internet will be completely different than any year prior. Exhibit A. Oxford researchers just confirmed what we feared.

### 📋 背景・概要

The internet, as we knew, is dying. AI content went from around 5% in 2020 to 48% by May 2025. Projections say 90 plus% by next year. Why? Well, AI articles cost less than 1 cent.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Human writers cost $10 to $100. And this was a post by Ask Perplexity. So, they continue. I just want to kind of make that distinction because before it was facts. Now we get maybe a little bit of conjecture, a little bit of opinion.

### 📝 詳細説明

They're saying but the real crisis is model collapse. When AI trains on AI generated content, quality degrades like photocopying a photocopy. Rare ideas disappear. Everything converges to generic sameness. It's recursive.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Today's AI slop becomes tomorrow's training data producing worse output which becomes training data again. So we'll see how this will affect training of next generation models. But definitely the one thing that's obvious is that very very recently just in the last few months I would say it seems like we've crossed the point where the internet got sort of inverted to where it went from mostly human to mostly AI. We just have to read the first comment here. It's by Asmin Gold.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Now Asmin Gold is a controversial persona. But what I found very interesting about this is here he's talking to an AI that's that's answering. So it's I don't know it's kind of a good illustration I feel like. So he is huge on used to be on Twitch now on YouTube has a large following started out playing World of Warcraft and more recently started talking about politics because I don't know just seems like the natural progression I guess but he's saying if the data collection methods are as simplistic as they indicate this is one of the dumbest pieces of research I've ever seen. Are you using a control to avoid equating an AI article with less than 10 views with one written that has like a thousand plus?

### 🎯 応用例

AI isn't killing journalism. Journalists are. The AI bot answers, "You're absolutely right. Good question." And provides some context. Anyways, I just thought this whole thing is hilarious.

### 💭 考察

It's an AI generated post that gets a comment from just an absolutely massive YouTuber. I mean, he's getting something like 300 million views on YouTube in the last 30 days. So, a rather large account, you would say. Just something about this whole thing cracks me up. By the way, AI safety memes posted this of the dead internet theory update.

### 📌 まとめ

Four out of the 10 YouTube channels are AI. Now, of course, it's not just open AI that's driving this. There's a lot of players in the space. Gemini, Anthropic, XAI. There's a number of AI video models, AI image models, AI music models.

### ✅ 結論

There's a number of other open-source LMS and other tools all contributing to this in part, but there's sort of another layer on top of this. So, as there's more and more AI generated content online, Sora 2 is still I think at the top of the leaderboards is one of the top apps. But now on top of this, we're getting more and more agentic stuff that's coming online. There's another sort of layer between us and the internet and those are the agents that we will be using to interact with the internet in various ways and in this video we're going to cover a few things by OpenAI what they've been announcing how they work etc. We'll briefly touch about their massive integration with various e-commerce platforms.

### 📚 追加情報

There's also a thermmoefficient openai collab to accelerate drug development through AI integration. Sora 2 has more features. You can do up to 25 seconds on the web. There's a storyboard feature. So Sora 2 is certainly on a roll.

### 🔖 補足

It doesn't seem to be stopping. Meanwhile, we have some news about the Open Eyes forprofit transition. So looks like Financial Times projected Open Eyes cap table following its forprofit transition. So here's sort of a chart showing what the ownership of OpenAI will look like. Looks like about 20 to 30% remains as a part of the OpenAI nonprofit.

### 🎨 セクション 13

30% going to employees, the rest to various investors and partners with apparently Nvidia's investment diluting everybody else. As Technium from News Research pointed out, if the nonprofit has 30%, then the remaining is 0%. We also have some new changes to memory to Chad's memory. No more memory full. It will automatically manage the memories based on how relevant they are, how recent they are, etc.

### 🚀 セクション 14

By the way, do you remember that social similacra paper out of Stanford? I believe Jung Park was the author of it, where a number of these little characters, each one controlled by an instance of Chad GPT. I don't know if it was GPT4 or 3.5 Turbo at the time. I don't recall, but their actions, their conversations, everything was driven by its own kind of instance of Chad GPT. Each one had its own memory.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So the memory stream would flow, all the things that would happen like whether you know it turned on the lights, it made coffee, right? So every event would be logged but later sort of sorted and analyzed based on recency, importance, relevance, right? So each would get a score like how important is that memory? This was August 6, 2023. The reason I bring that up is a couple points.

### 🌟 セクション 16

One, as I always say, we tend to see these research papers kind of it's almost like a glimpse into the future. you see something in a research paper that suggests a new approach for doing something or some new discovery and then the AI labs usually implemented 6 to 12 months later. In this case, it probably took a little bit longer. And in fact, I don't think it's quite the same thing as this, but it's just it's it's interesting. And two, I just think it's kind of cool that a lot of this progress towards AGI is driven by video games in one way or another.

### 🎬 セクション 17

us PC gamers by purchasing Nvidia cards in the past for our gaming needs. I like to think of it as us sort of investing and supporting the future of AI. You're welcome. But you've probably played a game or two yourself, so I guess uh high five. Also, Sam Alman is said to be loosening up some of the restrictions for some of the more adult themes and topics within Chad GBT.

### 📋 セクション 18

But first and foremost, let's talk about how agents will be changing the way that we use the internet. And this is based on two massive new products or features that OpenAI has launched. Quick interruption. This video is brought to you by Rube from Composeio. I connected my chat to over 800 apps and ran real actions without touching an API.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Rube is your super assistant for automation. Just type which you want, it performs the steps across all your tools. It connects to 800 plus apps and can perform 50,000 plus actions on top of them. You just say what you want in plain English and Rube does it for you. My favorite example is email triage like this.

### 📝 セクション 20

Setup takes minutes. Go to rub.app and add MCP points. Rub.appmcp. Use streamable HTTP in clients like Chad GBT, Cursor, Cloud Desktop, Mattis, WhatsApp or VS Code. Rub connects to hundreds of apps and enables thousands of actions from Gmail and notion to Slack, GitHub, and Sheets.

### 💡 セクション 21

Here it pulls in yesterday's emails, summarizes what matters, and bulk labels promos all with one command. Here's Matt Schumer. We've talked about him on the channel before. Here's what he said about Rube. One MCP to rule them all.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Watch it analyze thousands of tweets on Chad GPT and organized by painpoint in a sheet. By the way, Rube now integrates with Chad GBT as well. Use connectors in Chad GBT to get everything integrated. By the way, if you want a full tutorial on this, leave a comment down below. Here's Dr.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Alvaro Cintas. He works with Rowan on rundown AI. He's using Rube to create quote insane automated workflows. Watch it analyze his calendar and prioritize the week based on his notion tasks. I really like how it says urgent pay your electric bills.

### 💭 セクション 24

Those have deadlines. Rube has a shared memory layer. It remembers you across sessions and apps. Login once and you can execute actions across all of your connections. It runs in Chad GBT, Claude, Cursor, VS Code, N8N, and creators are already shipping content with it.

### 📌 セクション 25

Rub is your one command center. Control all your digital tools through AI with simple natural language. Plug Rube into your workflow today. It's free to try at rub.app. Thanks to Rub by Composio for sponsoring this segment.

### ✅ セクション 26

So on October 6th, Sam Alman announced OpenAI's new agent kit at the 2025 dev day. So it's a suite of tools for building, deploying, and optimizing AI agents. So we had things like the agent SDK before, but this just kind of streamlines it, makes it easier, and has a easy to use UI with the little flowcharts. Here's kind of what that looks like. So here you have your various functions.

### 📚 セクション 27

They can just kind of drag out here. Set up connect to other functions. Let's delete this one for now. And you basically just drag and drop. You can move them around.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Connect them as you see fit. So this one for example is a customer service workflow. Now for the last decade, I was running e-commerce stores and I wish I had this. Oh dear lord, how much easier would my life have been if I had this? I'm so frustrated this came out 10 years too late.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So what it is is we start with basically the input. In this case it would be a customer service email. So a customer writes an email to you. Customers can write these rambling emails. It's sometimes a little bit difficult to understand what is it that they actually want, right?

### 🚀 セクション 30

Do they want a a refund? Do they want to cancel something? They just want to check on their order. And in the past, you could do these like if else then, whatever logic statements, but you'd fail. They would fail very, very often because you're dealing with an unstructured output by some person typing it on their iPhone, and you just couldn't effectively triage this, right?

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, here we have the email coming in, right? That's the start. That's what begins this workflow. First and foremost, we have a they call it the jailbreak guard rail, but there's actually quite a few different things in here that are under that umbrella. Let me just do this.

### 🌟 セクション 32

There we go. So, we have personally identifiable information. It runs a check to make sure they're not sending you stuff that can be harmful if you post it out there. So, if you just want to make sure that it doesn't get into the system, if the workflow doesn't continue, right? So you can click this and if it contains any personally identifiable information, boom, it just ends their workflow, right?

### 🎬 セクション 33

So if it fails any of the checks that you've uh initiated, the workflow ends. We have moderation, right? So if they're saying naughty things, jailbreak, so this is if ply the prompter decides to mess with your AI customer service agent. So this should detect prompt injection and jailbreak attempts to keep the model on task hallucinations. Now this would be of course when the input is coming from a model.

### 📋 セクション 34

This isn't if you know if a human is writing it certainly they could be hallucinating but this is not what this is for right. So this kind of just makes sure that everything's cool. If it's not cool the process ends. If it is cool uh we go to the classification agent and we classify the user's intent into one of the following categories. Return item, cancel subscription or get information.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So again we're just showing the large language model. the email. We're like, "All right, if you had to put it into one of these three buckets, where would you put it?" We can select our model here, including a GPT5 and pretty much every other model that ever existed, we can uh use it here. Depending on which model you choose, there's also usually tons of options. So, if we choose a reasoning model, for example, like GPT5, some of these models you have to verify the organization, your organization for you to be able to use it.

### 📝 セクション 36

But for the Owen Pro, so that's a reasoning model. You can choose the reasoning effort and I think the reason they do that is because if you want to see the summary of the model's internal reasoning process, the chain of thoughts, right? You want to verify the company opening just wants to make sure that a competitor isn't stealing all that data. I'm sure that's one of the motivations. Anyways, here we have the classification agent that classifies the email.

### 💡 セクション 37

Then depending on what they decide the email is, we route it to the correct next place. In this case, the next agent that takes over. So if it's a return item, we go to this node. If it's a cancel subscription goes here. If it's just get information goes here.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And if it's something else, we just end the workflow here. Or if you wanted to, you can start something else and completely branch out from here. If you wanted, you needed to ask a follow-up or whatever. A return agent offers a replacement device with free shipping. Of course, you might want to have a user approval here so that the a human has to come in and be like, "Okay, uh uh this works for me." We also have a retention agent that tries to save the subscription, information agent that answers the questions, etc.

### 🎯 セクション 39

You can also add a hallucination guardrail here, right? So, if you want to make sure the information agent isn't tripping out of their mind, you might want to put a hallucination check there to make sure that it matches up against your internal documentation or whatever. they can do an online search, a file search, document search, whatever you need. And of course, you know, whatever else happens, you can kind of just end the process after that, right? So, this would take every customer email that comes in and sort of figure out what kind of email it is, what they want, and then have a specific agent handle that email.

### 💭 セクション 40

And there's, of course, a million things you can do with this. The point is smart automation and that we're going to be interacting with AI agents a lot more than humans at this point because as these models get better and better more and more tasks can be automated with simple processes like this. All right, next we have the third party apps integration with chatbt. So things like Spotify, Zillow, Canva and a million more. Basically a lot of the apps that are popular online now integrate with chatbt that you can chat with it.

### 📌 セクション 41

just tell it what to do and it will actually use those apps and provide you with the results. This obviously seems like kind of a big deal. It's basically the birth of a new app store. All right, let's check it out. We're going to use Canva to create a YouTube thumbnail about how to build ninja robots because why not?

### ✅ セクション 42

All right, so notice that it kind of talks about a little bit, but at some point we should get a little notification saying, do you want to use Canva for this? If you say yes, then this Canva appears down here. And for the first time that you're using a specific app, it's going to say Chpt wants to connect to that app. Let's say we click continue. There's some warning and conditions.

### 📚 セクション 43

And then you're going to click continue to Canva or whatever app you're adding. Canva is now connected. And Chad BT is going to work to create a thumbnail for us about how to build ninja robots using Canva. By the way, if you wanted to add more apps, you can do so here. Go to add sources, add.

### 🔖 セクション 44

You can connect any of the following ones you've already connected as well as a Gmail, calendar, contacts, box, or connect more. And if you scroll down, you have browse apps. So, we have Corsera, Spotify, Zillow, Figma, HubSpot, Notion, Outlook, Slack, etc., etc., etc. Or we can even do kind of customize and add our own. So, here you're able to add unverified connectors.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Use at your own risk. Let's try Spotify. And now it's connected. So now we are able to add sources and and now we should be able to call upon Spotify to play us our favorite content. Before we do that, let's check out our Canva.

### 🚀 セクション 46

If it finished working and making our thumbnails for building ninja robots, I got to say it did a phenomenal job. Look at that. If this is not a ninja robot, I don't know what is. It even came up with a pretty cool tagline. Stealth meets technology.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So all this has done is by saying hey use a Canva to do this and it does so. So so now I don't have to go to Canva use their UI or interact with that web page in any way. I can just sort of interact with Chad GPT and use that app however I want to. Let's see if I can say use Spotify just to kind of invoke it. Yeah, there it is.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Okay, so Spotify is ready to use. So I can say whatever I want. What are the top 20 AI podcasts? I wonder if it knows I'm okay. He knows I'm talking about Spotify.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Good. Because it has a context. Hooray. Not one of those podcasts is my podcast. I'm considering hitting the thumbs down button.

### 📋 セクション 50

Bad robot. No, I'm not going to do that. But that feels kind of petty, but I am irked. What are the latest episodes on the AI pod by Wesson Dylan? Let's see if we can uh make sure it pulls the right podcast this time.

### ⭐ セクション 51

All right, there it is. The last one is our interview with the CEO and founder of Apollo Research. And we're going to say play the latest episode. All right. So, I have to click to play and it'll take me to Spotify where I can listen to it.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, it looks like still it's not integrated within Chad GBT, but I can find all the episodes kind of browse, get some more information about them. So, I'm going to say, why is my podcast not number one when I ask for AI podcast and how do you rank them? I know I'm being childish, but just please humor me. So, it actually spells out kind of like what it's looking at to make sure that it's returning the right results. So, I do want to check this, but it's definitely giving me some ideas about how to maybe optimize some of my podcasts to appear more in Chad GPT.

### 💡 セクション 53

Now, this is probably for me, but if you have an app out there, you have a website, you have your own podcast, you might be aware that more and more traffic is flowing through Chad GBT, right? So, let Chad GBT flow through you, right? So more and more of our queries and referrals are flowing through Chad Gypt. So if you have apps, websites, businesses, whatever, it's going to be important to start figuring out how to make sure that you're getting your slice of the pie from ChadBt when people are asking about stuff that might be relevant to your business. Now notice, of course, over time these results will be personalized to you as it kind of gains a more understanding of what you like, what you like to listen to.

### 🔧 セクション 54

I'm going to say, what are the top AI podcasts on Spotify? not episodes but actual podcasts. By the way, the documentation for all this stuff is available at opening.com. So, if I don't forget, I'll put this link in the description, but this is called introducing apps in ChadBt. Here it will tell you what you need to do to get your app listed and also they have some guidelines for discoverability.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So, like what do you do to make sure that your app gets called more often? Now, why is this important? Is it just traffic, exposure, etc.? Well, not quite. There's a little bit more coming.

### 💭 セクション 56

As you see here, they're saying we'll also share details on monetization soon, including support for the new agentic commerce protocol, an open standard enables instant checkout in Chad GBT. Notice both Google and opening at this point. They're building that kind of like e-commerce more refers to like shopping. This is bigger than that. That's sort of this monetary layer, this this transaction layer on the internet that can be used by agents to buy services and engage in various activities.

### 📌 セクション 57

Interestingly, Google, as we've covered in a recent video, they've partnered up with Coinbase to handle the crypto side of those transactions, but they also have their own agent to agent payment protocol. And OpenI, of course, is building out their own side of it, right? So, buy it in Chad GPT, Instant Checkout, Agentic Commerce Protocol, and they're already partnering up with giants like Walmart and also Shopify. Shopify is huge. If you're a massive retailer online like Amazon, you sort of you have your own custom platform that you build.

### ✅ セクション 58

For a lot of other companies, including some rather large companies, they use Shopify. I've been doing e-commerce for a while. Shopify is is very good. There's some alternatives on WordPress which is open source which is nice but I'm guessing Shopify just dominates. So according to this chart, Shopify has 4.65 million worldwide e-commerce stores.

### 📚 セクション 59

It's one of the biggest platforms although some other statistics show it as not being the biggest with Woo Commerce being the biggest. So for example e-commerce usage distribution in the top 1 million sites. So Shopify is 20% which is still huge, right? With Woo Commerce that's the WordPress more. It's on top of WordPress.

### 🔖 セクション 60

That one is 27%. Oh, it looks like Shopify Plus is another 3%. So it's a little bit larger than that. The reason I bring that up is because a lot of this is getting integrated right into Chad GPT. So apps, checkouts, search, everything.

### 🎨 セクション 61

And you know, some smart guy or gal will figure out how to make millions or billions with this by being one of the early movers. So, I believe it said that Spotify was added September 2nd, I think it did. So, this app, the ability to connect this app was added, you know, not that long ago. By the way, as this grows, you know, other podcasting shows, other companies will want to be on this. So, we're very early on.

### 🚀 セクション 62

This might be a good time to poke around and see how things work. One other bit of news, this is from the information.com called OpenAI's growing ecosystem play. So, as we talked about, Chad GBT is going to have apps in Chad GBT. So, you can search for homes on Zillow or make Spotify playlists. OpenI's goal is to have a signin with Chad GPT just like you have signin with Google or Apple or whatever.

### ⚡ セクション 63

And this might be very interesting to startups that want to use AI powered features provided by OpenAI. The interesting thing here is that for certain products, this would allow the customer to sign into a product like cursor or some AI coding assistant and it's the customer's account that would power that app basically paying for the open eyes API usage. So if I use my chatbt account to log into cursor for example then whatever I do in cursor if that incurs any cost in terms of generating tokens through openai I would pay that through my own account. That's in the case if you're using something like an API. This article doesn't talk about that.

### 🌟 セクション 64

They're specifically talking about like if you have a pro account you let's say have 10 queries with GPT5 that you can run. So if you were to log into another app, that app would be able to use those queries on your behalf. So instead of the app paying for that service, it would be paid by sort of your account or at least offset by the 10 quote unquote free queries that you have. I hope that makes sense. So basically, you're using your account and its capacity, how many queries you're able to run against it to sort of subsidize the app and what they're doing on your behalf if you choose to log into that app through ChadBt.

### 🎬 セクション 65

I'm sure I completely butchered explaining that. So here's a picture of Sam Alman if it helps. And in other news, Thermo Fisher and OpenAI collab to accelerate drug development through AI integration. So this is interesting because of course Google DeepMind is doing a lot in that field with Alphafold and various other AI models. Recently they had a massive medical breakthrough, brand new ground AI assisted discovery.

### 📋 セクション 66

We will cover that in a different video because that deserves its own separate video because it seems kind of huge. So, Thermo Fisher announced a landmark collab with OpenAI today to embed advanced artificial intelligence across its clinical trials business, aiming to accelerate drug discovery, simplify the research process, and get medicines to patients faster and cheaper. That's it in a nutshell. The rest of the article just repeats that same thing in many different ways. So, it's kind of hard to tell how huge this is.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Is it just like, oh, the employees, the doctors, the researchers now have access to Chad GPT or some specific slightly tweaked version of it or this is something greater? It's hard to tell so far just from this. Of course, in other news, Walmart has announced a major partnership with OpenAI to build AI first shopping experiences directly into Chad GBT. You'll be able to shop Walmart Sam's Club using instant checkout. Wouldn't it be funny if Sam Alman at some point just opening I grow so much that it takes over Walmart and he would change Walmart to Alt Mart and Sam's Club to I'm still Sam's Club.

### 📝 セクション 68

I don't really care either way. I shop at Costco. And they're saying that the move shifts the model from reactive search to Agentic Commerce that predicts and plans shopping needs. This is where it could get kind of weird obviously, right? Because if there's some sort of a commercial pressure to push certain products, your favorite AI chatbot might be forced to just pitch you various crap you don't need.

### 💡 セクション 69

Again, I mean, there's a right and a wrong way to go about that. Let me know what your gut feeling is. Do you think this is going to be handled smart and with the consumer in mind or foolishly with the profit margins in mind? Sora 2 is wildly successful. 56,000 downloads in the first day of release.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Then you had 164,000 times in the first two days. Keep in mind it's invite only. So they they do have that kind of scarcity built in and that might be part of the magic that's driving this. Now Sam Alman is aware of this idea that Chad PT must never trade trust for ad dollars. So certainly that's been a concern for me.

### 🎯 セクション 71

I tend to nowadays rely on Chad PT for research. If the quality gets worse because somebody's trying to pitch me some product, number one, I'll lose a very valuable resource, trust with that company with Chad GBT will be broken. I'm hoping the other AI companies will have enough pressure there to kind of like it won't make sense for one of them to just cash in because we'll have other options, right? So, if there's Grock and Gemini, Anthropic and Chad, you know what? If if one of them is ruining their trust by just pushing ads in front of people, we can go somewhere else.

### 💭 セクション 72

But it almost does feel like the internet as we have known it all this time is going away, getting replaced by AI. Instead of browsing, we have our agents go out there and do things for us. Instead of searching, we run whatever GPT5 Pro or whatever you're using to do that research. Will Sor 2 be more popular than Tik Tok and YouTube Shorts and Instagram? We'll see.

### 📌 セクション 73

I'm not quite sure where that one's going, although it's been pretty popular so far. So, we'll see if that sort of fades away, the novelty fades away, or it just continues. And according to Epic AI, Open AI is experiencing one of the fastest revenue growth rates in corporate history with annualized revenue rising 3x a year from 2 billion at the end of 2023 to 13 billion by August 2025. So there's revenue growth. A lot of these large massive companies that have more cash than some nations, they're pouring in a lot of money into these various deals and building out data centers.

### ✅ セクション 74

And while some people are convinced that we're at the peak of the bubble, this train doesn't seem to be slowing down. So, either we're just picking up speed or we're about to go off the rails. Let me know what you think. Leave a comment down below. Thank you so much for watching.
