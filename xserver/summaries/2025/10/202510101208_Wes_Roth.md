## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Have there been AI news today? Yes, there has. The first one is Figure03. This is Brett Atcock, founder of Figure Robotics. He has two missions in life.

### 📋 背景・概要

One is to build the robotic future for us. And his second, more recent mission started when he tried to engrave an Apple product with his name, Adcock, which Apple did not like, not one bit. It seems like he was amused at first, but very soon it turned into a drive to dethrone Apple. Can you guess what the name of his new company will be? I'm pretty sure this isn't even a joke.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

No, he's literally starting a project, you know, the last part of his name and a block. And he's putting in significant personal capital. He's had several big exits, so he's got a lot of personal capital. If you're interested, they're also hiring for a CCO position. Man, everyone's hating on Apple right now.

### 📝 詳細説明

In other news, we have some rumors about an imminent new release of VO. Some of those are known to be false, but some of them are true. We'll take a look at that. As well as some weird news from Arc AGI and exactly where the new OpenAI model lands on the ARC AGI benchmark and Dario Amade, the founder and CEO of Anthropic is in some hot water, or at least something he said is costing him. Also, we have our state of AI report 2025 by Nathan Benet and much much more.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, make sure you're sticking around till the end of the video. And first and foremost, here's that figure 03. This is a robot that's coming to your home very very soon. You know, if you wanted to. But really fast, let's take a look at the robot.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

They're using some music in the background. I don't know if I have the copyright to that or who holds the copyright. So, I'm going to be using some music that I've created in Suno AI. [Music] Yeah. Whispers and shadows they call my name.

### 🎯 応用例

A candle flickers, but it's not the same. They say prove your worth. No time to stop. I'm walking the edge. I collude of velvet sky.

### 💭 考察

Hide the blade. Secrets born in the shade. What's the color of the night? Sangu my brother. That's right.

### 📌 まとめ

What's the color of the night? Blood red under pale moonlight. Steps in silence through the holo hall. Echoes linger where the dagger falls. The vowing whispers are packed in flame.

### ✅ 結論

No faces, no mercy, no room for shame. Velvet sky hide the place. Secrets born in a shade. >> What's the color of the night? Sangu, my brother, that's right.

### 📚 追加情報

What's the color of the night? Blood red on a pale moon. [Music] As you know, in my past life, I spent a decade running e-commerce stores. Launching products and marketing campaigns would take weeks. Today, I'm going to do that for a brand new Shopify product in under an hour using an AI platform called LTX Studio.

### 🔖 補足

Thank you LTX Studio for sponsoring this video. If you run ecom, you know the grind. Product shots, UGC, B-roll, cuts, voice over, timing. It's slow and expensive. LTX Studio is an all-in-one platform that takes your idea from multi-shot video, storyboard, shots, timeline, export, all in one place.

### 🎨 セクション 13

I'm using their new project setup so my Genpace storyboard and timeline live together. First, product visuals in Genpace with Flux Premium for crisp ultra realistic images. Then click to turn image into video. There are several models to choose from depending on your needs. Add motion using camera motion presets and key frame controls for repeatable pro moves.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Drop everything into the timeline editor to time hooks. add auto SFX to music and voice over. >> It's a fast-paced world we live in. >> They also just added Google's nano banana integration, and I'm using it to do super easy iterations and highquality image editing. No need for Photoshop.

### ⚡ セクション 15

When I want cinematic quality, I switch models. LTXV Turbo for fast iterating, LTXV 13B for higher fidelity, or step up to VO when I need that final pixel look. In under an hour, I've got a testable ad pack, hooks, benefits, lifestyle, and product in use variations ready to AB test. If you want fewer tools, and faster results, try LTX Studio linked down below. So, one interesting thing about the figure presentation is nothing in that film is teley operated.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So a lot of the demos that we've seen by robots, they are teleyoperated, meaning that there's a person somewhere with, you know, maybe VR goggles and some sort of a feedback gloves that is controlling what the robot does or at least that's how those robots are trained with teley operation if that's how we're sort of gathering data for them. It's kind of like the VR goggles plus the gloves. So I guess when you have the final product, it can be probably operated through any number of means. But the point is most of the robots that we see out there, especially if they're like on a conference floor engaging with human beings, they're probably teley operated in some way or another. This figure 03, according to Brett Ako, the founder of the company, nothing in that video that we saw is teley operated.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So that would imply that it is autonomous. And I got to say, you know, if all that checks out, then this is incredibly incredibly impressive. Now, I'm wondering if you notice the pattern of what you have to add to the robots if they're meant to go inside a residential place, inside your home, as opposed to if they're going inside a factory. There's one minor but very important difference. That important distinction that is needed for robots to be allowed in the household is clothes or at least some sort of a cloth that you throw over it somehow making it more appropriate for the home.

### 📋 セクション 18

Here, Dedric is saying, "Figure three introduces fabric layer design, a garmentlike shell over precision hardware." That's not to be confused with the Terminator. That's a cybernetic organism, living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. I figure I just throw that in there. >> I'll be back. >> But they're saying that this new figure 03 is the third generation humanoid robot.

### ⭐ セクション 19

It's designed for Helix. Helix, I believe they talked about earlier. I think we covered it in one of our earlier videos. basically their sort of world model. I believe it's a vision language model.

### 📝 セクション 20

Apparently designed to run on the robot, so you don't need to connect to the cloud or whatever. It's all on board. They don't put too much detail out about it, which I guess kind of makes sense, but certainly I think a lot of people would love to know more. If you recall a while back, OpenAI and Figure Robotics were going to team up to develop these robots using OpenAI models. later figure withdrew from the deal citing a major breakthrough.

### 💡 セクション 21

So the CEO, founder and CEO Brett Adcock was tight lipped in terms of specifics, but promised that we're going to be seeing something massive never before seen on a humanoid in the next 30 days. So the system allows for just better vision and a better ability to interact with the world, new ability to grip fine objects without breaking them, etc. because it's designed for the home as I've told you earlier, right? That's covered in soft textiles rather than hard machined parts. It's interesting, but it's that's almost like going to be a lie.

### 🔧 セクション 22

I feel like if you want your robot for the house, it has to have some sort of cloth on it. I'm sure somebody did a bunch of user testing. I was like, "These people hate it unless you cover it up with something." So, Figure has absolutely just incredible and stunning videos of their robots doing all sorts of stuff and it's very well choreographed and it just looks stunning. It looks like a futuristic movie. A lot of people online, myself included, have asked to just see more raw footage, more behind the scenes kind of just interactions with these robots.

### 🎯 セクション 23

something that's not very polished, but maybe just like a live stream where we can just see what it does. Like, have we seen just like a normal person interact with one of these things? That would be really, really cool to see. Like, right now, we've seen these movies, these things that they've shown us, but we haven't seen any like realworld interaction, just raw footage, live stream, normal human beings interacting with it. I think everybody would love to see that.

### 💭 セクション 24

There was even a Time article on the figure 03. CEO Brett Ako says robotics is on a similar curve to digital AI suggesting that big capability jumps are coming. And this is true. We've seen multiple CEOs of big companies including Demis Hassabus saying that we should expect to see some pretty big jumps in robot capabilities pretty soon. And Figure is hoping to have Figure 3 in select homes next year, which would be incredible to see.

### 📌 セクション 25

Tons of people are making a lot of noise about VO3.1 coming soon and how incredible it's going to be. Some issues there. Only one problem here where it says VO3.1 is coming soon exclusively on Vadu AI. Logan Kilpatrick of Google DeepMind says this is not true. So whether he's referring to the fact that it's exclusively in this platform, which obviously it won't be, or the fact that it's coming soon, so we're not sure.

### ✅ セクション 26

But for the time being, it sounds like VO3.1 will be coming at some point. We don't know exactly when and that there's a lot of misinformation out there about it. So take everything with a grain of salt. Greg Camrad of Arc AGI. So he's saying that GPT5 Pro now holds the highest score for a commercially available from TLM on ARC AGI.

### 📚 セクション 27

Great performance and fun, but not cheap. I personally only use GPT5 Pro for my hairiest problems like planning, large code, debug, etc. It costs about 4 to 5,000 for all ARC tasks across four sets. So here is ARC AGI 1. So Grock was the sort of leader in that for quite some time.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And this that purple dot is Grock 4, I believe. These two things we'll talk about in a second, but these were modifications made by machine learning researchers. They used Grock. So, this is also Grock, but not the default Grock, so to speak. And as you can see here, GPT5 Pro edges out Grock 4 by just a little bit, right?

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, maybe if Grock 4 was a 66%, GPT5 Pro is maybe 70%, something like that. Oh, it's a 70.2%. But notice that the cost per task is significantly higher. Notice this is a logarithmic chart. So it goes from 1 cent to10 to a dollar to $10 to 100 to a,000.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So this jump is from right around a dollar to about $478 per task. Now there's one thing that's very weird about this chart and that is this. Let me just scooch it over to the right a little bit because all the way on the right here you see 03 preview. So 03 preview is higher on the score than either Gro 4 or GBT 5 Pro, but it's incredibly expensive on the sort of per task metric. So kind of depending on where this is, maybe it's it's a few hundred per task, definitely over a hundred and on this logarithmic scale, it's hard to tell, but maybe $200 to $300 per task.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Uh whatever that is. Greg mentions that here saying that GBT5 Pro still isn't at the performance of the 03 Preview model we tested in December 2024. Right? So almost a year ago, about 10 months ago, we had the 03 Preview at 75.7 at about $200 per task. They he says here and the GPT5 Pro, so the current best from OpenAI only gets 70% but is significantly cheaper at 478.

### 🌟 セクション 32

By the way, if you're wondering about these dots up here, so as you can see here, E Pang and J Burman 2025. So Jay Burman is sitting at 80%. So that's the highest result. So that's actually a modification of Croc 4. This person Jeremy Burman, I'll link his I'll link his uh X-profile down below, but he is the person that got that high score.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Believe it or not, he has a Substack, which shouldn't come as a surprise. Everyone has a substack I guess at this point, but his explains how he was able to actually achieve that result. So he explains kind of what ARC AGI is, why it's important. Here he's explaining his method. So keep in mind he did what he did with Grock 4, but he actually had a version one of the solution first.

### 📋 セクション 34

So he's explaining how he did that. So this was from December 6, 2024. So there he used sonnet 3.5 with evolutionary test time compute. So by having these models create Python functions, he would be able to test them to see how well they worked, if they were getting closer or not, and kind of doing this evolutionary research to find the best solutions. I'll leave this link in the description if you're interested.

### ⭐ セクション 35

It's a good read. Unfortunately, it's going to take a little bit too long, but it's interesting because he explains how he did it based on his version one. So if you think about the evolutionary tree search or however you want to evolutionary search, that's kind of what he did, right? Right? So he had his first idea and eventually built on top of that creating this the final architecture.

### 📝 セクション 36

So we have the task input initial generation Gro 4 generates 30 candidate solutions evaluate and score test against training samples. And if it's a perfect solution versus not right so if yes then we go to hoay solution found if no we do revisions evaluation to see if that's a perfect solution or not. If no, then we do pulled revision. Synthesize top five instructions generate five new candidates. So keep in mind this is similar to what we saw with alpha evolve.

### 💡 セクション 37

It wasn't the same approach but kind of like that scaffolding that system was similar. It allowed for sampling the large language model. So basically asking for multiple answers and then it had certain grading and revision steps. So over time through kind of this evolutionary tree was able to find better and better approaches. Sakana AI did something very very similar with their Darwin girdle machine I believe it's called.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So same thing the evolutionary research for a self-improving coding agent. And there's a number of other ones that I'm probably blanking on right now. But the point is that notice these systems tend to produce really good results. We're seeing the same approach used at Sakana AI at Google DeepMind and now by this researcher to top the Arc AGI leaderboard. So just to kind of give you an idea, this is where most of the models are.

### 🎯 セクション 39

This was Grock for thinking, right? And this is that result that I just showed you. So notice how big of a leap that is. In some other news, Chinese researcher Shunyu Yao left Anthropic to join Deep Mind. A big portion of the reason, 40% of it was he strongly disagreed with the anti-China statements Anthropic has made.

### 💭 セクション 40

As Eugene Jyn is saying here, Dario's first experience with AI was at BYU, a Chinese company. He learned about scaling laws there. Strange that he made those wild public statements and drove talent away. Note also that researchers said that the remaining 60% of why he's leaving is complicated. Most of them contain internal anthropic information.

### 📌 セクション 41

Thus, I can't share it. That does sound kind of bad though, doesn't it? Next, let's quickly jump through just a couple of the slides from the state of AI report 2025. OpenAI is still leading this year, but the pack is closing in fast. Also, while the US is still holding the frontier, China is a credible number two.

### ✅ セクション 42

Of course, we've seen Quen, Deepseek, Kimmy, Moonshot, etc. that are very good open source models. Of course, we've seen a lot of talks about reinforcement learning really scaling up and getting more and more used to train these large language models to do better at specific tasks. So, we're seeing this reinforcement learning RL with verifiable rewards RLVR. So, that's verifiable correctness for math and coding.

### 📚 セクション 43

So this is something that some of the OpenAI researchers alluded to after, you know, the OpenAI models did extremely well at the various coding and math competitions that we've seen at the AT coder world finals. One of the internal OpenAI models was holding as the number one contestant and it was battling many many humans. It was the first one. It was going to beat every single human that competed until in the last 30 minutes of the match. I think it was like 10 hours long.

### 🔖 セクション 44

The competition was 10 hours long. In the last 30 minutes, Siho, a human, hooray, takes the lead. It takes the number one spot. But man, is it getting harder and harder to beat these AIs and we think that this RLVR is what OpenAI is crediting with as being able to do at least it's one piece of the puzzle that makes them so good at math and coding. Of course, we had tons of news about OpenAI and Google winning all sorts of math competitions.

### 🎨 セクション 45

I missed this part. This is interesting. So, Alpha Zero teaches chess grand masters new concepts. So, not only can these machines just beat us at various games like chess. This is showing that it's able to discover strategies and improve the gameplay of grand masters, the best players in the world.

### 🚀 セクション 46

We've seen tons of news about these large language models, these AI systems doing new scientific discovery. Here's yet another one. Google's deep mind co-scientist and Stanford's virtual lab generate debate and validate hypothesis discovering new and established ideas as science. There's a previous video that I did where we saw Scott Aronson that was able to publish a paper with a proof of some mathematical concept. I will not even attempt to pretend like I understand it.

### ⚡ セクション 47

It involves Merlin Arthur and quantum states as well as time travel. I think I mean not actual time travel but he was able to get some solution some proof that the he later used to publish a paper using a GPT5 pro I believe and he said that that marked the first time that a an AI system like a large language model that was the first time it contributed a key piece a key technical piece that he needed to come up with a paper or proof and of course that wasn't the only one we also have this thing we just mentioned and a number of other examples. There's still not tons of them, but there's a few like a handful that are beginning to slowly emerge, and I'm sure a lot more are coming. AIS will help drive our scientific discovery forward. Period.

### 🌟 セクション 48

It's already beginning to happen. Some more advancements with protein language models. You're going to be hearing the term proteomics a lot more moving forward. I imagine it's like genomics but for for proteins proteomics capability per dollar is doubling every few months. Google deep minds rate is 3.4 months.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Open eyes is 5.8. More predictable gains are driving more investment and more intelligence for less money. AI software adoption is going up. We now have that 44% of US businesses pay for AI up from just 5% in 2023. The average contract value is expected to double from half a million to over a million next year and the 12-month retention is now 80 plus percent.

### 📋 セクション 50

AI first companies continue to outperform other sectors and that's not by valuation, that's by revenue. So some of these numbers are a little bit conflicting with that whole idea of the bubble popping. It does seem like the models are improving, getting cheaper, that there's revenue growth. Also keep in mind that a lot of these large capital expenditures that these companies are doing, a lot of people point to them as sort of a signs of a bubble forming. But a lot of these companies that are spending those huge sums of money.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Those companies already have more cash on hand than some nations. And a lot of this growth is funded by that cash that they have on hand. It's not leveraged. It's not borrowed. They have large gobs of money.

### 📝 セクション 52

and they take some of those gobs of money and they invest it in AI and data centers etc. So this seems like something very different from kind of what happened in the dotcom days right where it was just like hypen speculation. This seems more like established sort of giants building out the AI infrastructure. But I will say that the AMD stock shooting up 50% once they announced their deal with OpenAI, that does seem pretty wild. I'm I'm not going to lie.

### 💡 セクション 53

And I was today years old when I realized that this guy, this is of course a Steve Carell in the movie The Big Short. If you haven't seen it, it's a great movie. It's about the big housing crisis back in 0809. It's a great movie. It's a great character.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's based on a real life person. His name is Steve Eisman. I was today years old when I realized that he's actually on YouTube now. So about six months ago, he decided to start on YouTube to start talking about the investment and certainly an interesting character that's been doing various investments for a long time. Really understands how the economy functions, how investments and all that stuff functions.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And I just today realized he's on here, but I watched just a few videos where he's talking about kind of like what's happening with AI. Is it a bubble? And again, as far as I can tell, just from the few videos that I watched, he's not seeing it. So, the outspoken guy from the big short does not believe that we're in a bubble in part because of some of the things that I said. Again, some of these companies that are spending money have more money than a lot of nations out there.

### 💭 セクション 56

They have a lot of cash on hand. They're pouring it into infrastructure, but that's it's not leveraged. It's cash. And it's not sort of hoping, speculating that something will go up. They're they're building out data centers and all the other stuff that they need for their tech to run.

### 📌 セクション 57

But do not take any investment advice from me. I have no idea what I'm talking about. If you made this far, thank you so much for staying with me and I will see you in the next
