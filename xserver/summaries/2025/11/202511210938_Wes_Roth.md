## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, Google keeps dropping hit after hit. A few days ago, we got the news that Gemini 3 has landed, and as much hype as we've had for the release of that model, it's I think still managed to surprise and outperform people's expectations. But Google is not done because they're dropping yet another big release today. It is Nano Banana Pro. And as you'll see, not only does it have really good capabilities, but it's already being rolled out to a lot of other Google tools.

### 📋 背景・概要

It's becoming integrated with a lot of different parts of Google's business. This is going to have a big impact. Let me show you why. I just realized I had my personal photo album showing on screen. I apologize about that.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh that's that's so embarrassing. These are very very personal photos. All right. So, this is a Nana Banana Pro. It's integrated with Gemini 3.

### 📝 詳細説明

The biggest thing you're probably going to notice about this model is how good the text generation is. So, here is a scene that was developed from this input image. Notice it's taped to a desk. Perfect kind of drown out rectangles, facial features, and the text is absolutely incredible. And we finally know the answer to the age-old question about woodchuck capacity to chuck wood.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Notice a perfect sort of lettering made out of wood. Very realistic breaks and cuts on these on the timber. And a very mad looking woodchuck. Maybe he's just tired of us questioning his ability. Here's the word Berlin.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Very much kind of nested within this building. Shadows definitely looks very much like integrated into the building. It's not just written on there. It's part of the architecture. Tons of typography, expressive words used in logos.

### 🎯 応用例

You can give it an example font and then have it write something out. Make impossible four-dimensional shapes out of out of letters. So, this says impossible, but uh made with impossible shapes. Also, the scientific infoggrams and diagrams are absolutely incredible. As you'll notice, this is going to get integrated with tools like a notebook alm.

### 💭 考察

But think about what an impact this would have on education. The ability to quickly, easily, and accurately create very engaging diagrams and infographics for for kids, for students. This could be very powerful. Input image into an infographic about this plant. Here's a recipe with all the ingredients and steps to prepare chai showing prisms and refraction.

### 📌 まとめ

It easily translates from language to language. Even if it's a sort of a part of a product, you can easily translate into any other language just by asking. And these will be rolling out with tools like Google ads, you know, the Google e-commerce platform. Google of course has their Google merchant center that you can sell online, integrative ads, etc. So stuff like this could very easily take any product that you already have uploaded, localize it to anywhere in the world, create variations, etc.

### ✅ 結論

This makes running an online store very easy. Take any input image and apply it to any product, coffee cup or bag or poster on the city street. Studio quality image editing. You know, change the field of view. Here's another one.

### 📚 追加情報

Zoom out and kind of create the entire scene around this zoomedin input image. change the time of day, day to night, etc. We're also seeing very strong character consistency, especially when we're talking about a lot of different characters trying to be in a scene. Here we have 14 fluffy characters that are all sort of arranged on the couch watching TV from these input images. Okay, really fast.

### 🔖 補足

I want to show you how I used AI to make my dream a reality. Literally, I had this weird dream and I wanted to make it into a short movie. In the past, this would have required tons of equipment, various production tools, and maybe weeks of work. It's slow and expensive. Today, I can do it in one afternoon with a single AI platform called LTX.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Thank you to LTX for sponsoring this video and making my dream come true. Again, literally not a figure speech. I literally had this dream. LTX takes you from idea or dream to storyboard to final video in one workflow. It's built for creators, agencies, and storytellers.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I start in the storyboard space to outline scenes and shots. LTX keeps track of the location, the style, and the characters that are involved in every shot or scene. To start with, you create an image that's going to become the shot you had in mind. You're able to use Flux, Flux Premium, and Nano Banana to get that perfect look. Here's kind of the shot as I saw in my mind.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And here's the video. [Music] The first shot and the first scene is complete. You go shot by shot through every single scene until you have your story done. Notice the character consistency. Same people, same location, same haircuts, and the same clothes.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Pick the shot you want, turn it into a video. There's a lot of video and audio models to choose from. The new addition is the LTX2 model. The fast version for quick brainstorming, idea generation, shot selection, etc., and a pro version for those highfidelity, highquality shots. You also have Google's V2 and VO3.1 models that you can use.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Here's the output and shot two is done. Next, we wrap up the middle few shots. And no, I don't want to talk about what happened other than to say that it captured my nightmare perfectly. In just under an hour, I've recreated my dream. The location, the characters, the clothes, everything is consistent across the entire shot.

### 📋 セクション 18

This includes audio and voices of the characters. Your elements collections allows you to save everything in one place to be reused across scenes and productions. Save your characters, props, products, and places. I nailed that final dramatic scene, and my video is ready to go. >> I've learned something important today.

### ⭐ セクション 19

>> I can share the video or get a pitch deck or just download the entire package so I can edit it in Adobe Premiere or anything I want or just download the MP4 video. If you want to direct, storyboard, and finish in one place, try LTX with the link in the description. Here is the performance Gemini 3 Pro image. So again, they might be doing away with the Nano Banana naming scheme, which is very unfortunate, but notice how nothing else comes close. And in terms of latency, it's it's fairly in line with the competition and a lot faster than GPT image 1.

### 📝 セクション 20

There's still some limitations, so double check the outputs, but we're seeing a pretty big improvement from Gemini 2. Flash image in terms of text rendering, stylization, multi-turn. So keeping a consistency as we're making multiple edits. One of the earlier models of probably Gemini 2.5 flash image. I remember if you made too many tweaks to the same image after a while it started getting a little bit weird.

### 💡 セクション 21

We have improvements in character editing, object editing, and general text to image capabilities. We also have some new capabilities that are being tested. So meaning these are basically new benchmarks that these models are getting better at such as multic character editing chart editing actual factuality for education multi-input infographics doodle editing and visual design. So when we're talking about text rendering Gemini 3 pro image nano banana pro is very very good. So here we're measuring the error rate.

### 🔧 セクション 22

All right so the lower the better. So dark blue means a lot of errors and kind of a white or super light blue here that means less errors and we're testing across many different languages Arabic, German, Spanish. We have Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc. Notice Gemini 3 Pro image is really good across the board. The least errorprone as far as I can tell saying we went bananas for nano banana.

### 🎯 セクション 23

He's not wrong. Here is an example of a complex infographic about the Golden Gate Bridge that was just drawn on top of the image of the Golden Gate Bridge. We'll test some of these things out in a second, but this is looking great. It's getting incorporated into Notebook LM. Notebookm is an incredibly useful tool for doing research, kind of condensing information.

### 💭 セクション 24

You can throw a bunch of papers and slides and PDFs and links in there, just whatever you want, videos, audio, whatever. And then just talk the entire sort of corpus of data to try to get specific things that you need from it. Or just create kind of an executive summary and outline or and this is the thing that I use it most for is just have it generate a podcast about the thing and then you can listen to two hosts kind of like just talk about what's happening in all that data that you've uploaded. And the podcasts are really good. And now with this new nano banana, it looks like it's going to be able to generate these infographics.

### 📌 セクション 25

Its ability to generate pixel art is phenomenal. So it sounds like this is the reference image. It's Pikachu, the kind of the original, and it's able to create new scenes with different people, different Pokemon, different trainers, backgrounds, etc. It's looking good. It apparently will also include well-known real life people in these images.

### ✅ セクション 26

At least as far as I can tell. I mean, it's kind of obvious who that is, right? Shout out to this person at Marmaduke091. So, they put up some crazy tests for both Gemini 3 Pro as well as this Nano Banana Pro. I mean, we've got the 10 celebrities.

### 📚 セクション 27

This one I thought was absolutely excellent. Power Rangers, Once Upon a Time, directed by Quinton Tarantino. So, I got to say, I mean, he looks exactly like himself. That's spoton. Brad Pitt, perfect.

### 🔖 セクション 28

DiCaprio, perfect. I'm assuming this is supposed to be Uma Thurman right in yellow like she was in Kill Bill. I wonder if Natal Banana chose to put her as the yellow Power Ranger or not. The only thing is that doesn't quite look like her. But I'd be curious to know if that's who they were going for.

### 🎨 セクション 29

In other words, are the three reference images these three or is there four with Uma Thurman and it just kind of didn't quite get her likeness? But man, this is incredible. Here's Dan Mack using a Nano Banana Pro to create this non-technical guide for the transformer. The level of detail here is absolutely incredible. So notice the input text.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You can tell what it's saying, right? The cat sat on the mat, right? It gets tokenized. We have the encoder, decoder, self attention mechanism. And then we have the output probabilities and generation.

### ⚡ セクション 31

They're showing kind of that roulette wheel to demonstrate that there's some sort of statistical distribution, some probability of different words coming out. And it's saying the cat sat on the mat. But the level of detail is very, very impressive here. Jimmy Apples is using a Nano Banana Pro to generate why Black and White was so influential. A infographic about the game Black and White.

### 🌟 セクション 32

This I think is an image from the first one. It's a very interesting game. By the way, this was one of the developers on the Black and White game development team. Can you recognize who that is? It's actually Demis Hassabus.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Yes, the guy that's working on Nano Banana and Gemini 3 and AGI for us. But this is a really good infographic because first of all they they hit on the thing that this was one of the games, one of the earlier games where they were actually trying to use AI for behavior of these in-game characters. Revolutionary neural networks allowed creatures to learn from player actions, developing unique personalities. So depending on how you treated your giant creature monster, that's how it would behave. That's how it would treat the villagers.

### 📋 セクション 34

If you were nice, it would help the villagers. And if you were a jerk, it would not help the villagers and do various mean things to them instead. So, Black and White pioneered god games, advanced AI and emergent gameplay. This is this is incredible that you're able to create something this educational and interesting and just visually kind of stunning very very simply by using this image generating AI. Again, I feel like we're used to calling it Nana Banana, but I think Google is going to start slowly transfer transferring over to calling it Gemini 3 Pro image generation or whatever they're going to call it.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Here's a San Francisco monster map. So, next time you're there, this is kind of some of the areas to avoid. And of course, right now, we're able to put ourselves with various celebrities. Joe Rogan, Schwarzenegger, Colbear, we got the cast of friends. you're able to just take a block of text, paste it in there, and it can create an entire book with images for you.

### 📝 セクション 36

And the thing is, I can't spot any errors in terms of misspellings or even letters looking weird. It's it's at a little bit of an angle, and it's still looking perfect. But let's take it out for a spin and see what it can do. All right, so first and foremost, I got a picture of myself and say, create a picture of this person from 10 years old to 80 for every decade. I love how it generated these images because notice while I am losing hair up until my 40s, I begin regrowing it back well into my 70s.

### 💡 セクション 37

Not sure how that works, but I'm still kind of excited by this. I surprisingly don't have too many photos of me kind of just out there in the wild. I'm either looking very goofy for a thumbnail, as you are no doubt aware, or there's people around me. Some of them probably don't want to appear on these channels with various AI modified images. So, this one was a selfie that I took before going to a conference just to make sure I didn't look weird or whatever.

### 🔧 セクション 38

I asked it to make me look like the star in the movie Commando, which of course stars Arnold Schwarzenegger. And it made me basically into Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is cool, but not quite what I was looking for. So, I had to modify a little bit, saying, "No, no, keep like my face and change the body type, clothes, and face paint." And it did. And I mean, I'm loving this. I got the the face paint like the camo bodysuit.

### 🎯 セクション 39

What do you call it? Tactical gear. Notice the knife. I think that's a reference to the movie. He has a very similar knife in the movie.

### 💭 セクション 40

Face paint. Just everything is perfect. And so I did a number of variations on that particular image. So this is the original unedited. Here's me going commando or not going commando.

### 📌 セクション 41

I'm not actually it. Let's just move on. Here's me with a suit of plate armor made out of bananas. Shout out to Matt Vidpro for the original idea. And here's that same image.

### ✅ セクション 42

So, the original image and me saying, "Have me take a selfie with 10 random female celebrities." And there's so much about this that I love, honestly. Like, the only thing that's off really is is the fact that the screen is facing us, not the other way around. That's obviously a little bit weird, but everything else is looking great. I don't know how tall these people are, so I don't know how accurate it is, but but notice there's no phantom limbs or anything else as far as I can tell. Even though there's a rather large number of people in the shot, notice it decided to put Beyonce barefoot on her tippy toes.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, that's kind of an interesting sort of artistic decision it made. But things are getting weirdly realistic. And I guess this would be a good time to talk about the synth ID, how how Google generates these images to make sure that we know their AI generated, how it sort of watermarks them. Now, of course, you probably know there's this little mark in the bottom right corner of every generated image, but those are easy to crop out. So, Google has a synth ID, so it's a tool to watermark and identify content generated through AI.

### 🔖 セクション 44

And we used to not know what is real, what is not. you have to look at these tiny little details, how many fingers and fingernails they have, etc. But it's getting a lot harder to tell. So now Google is embedding these little watermarks. You can tell they're not really visible to your eye, but you're able to upload it to this synth detector and it's able to tell you has this been generated with AI or not, or at least has been generated with an AI model that's that's using this technology like the Google models.

### 🎨 セクション 45

but they're also partnering with other people and providing this synth ID to others that want to use it within their generated AI arts and text and video. All right, next up it's me and Dylan. We're hanging out in Las Vegas. I met him in real life one time for a few days when I went to Vegas for a conference, but you won't believe who else we ran into there at the conference in Vegas just kind of in the middle of some random mall. It was Elon Musk and Sam Alman.

### 🚀 セクション 46

As you can see clearly from these images, I'm not sure what they were doing there, but they decided to take a little photo with us, for which we are very, very thankful. They even joined us for the conference later. I would have expected them to cause a bigger scene, but no. Apparently, they camouflage pretty well. Okay, but seriously, what was used to create those images, right?

### ⚡ セクション 47

So, for this one, we took the following images. So, this is one, this is two, and this is three. And I just said combined all the people in the images, those three images. And that's how we got this image. As far as I can tell, everything's looking good.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Notice the shadows, the reflections. I mean, everything fits in with the original image. As far as I can tell, there's always some of you in the comments that that point out something that I missed that is obviously out of place, but I'm, you know, here I'm not seeing it. I mean, maybe it morphed my foot here just a little bit, but it's it's not really that noticeable. I also asked to make these two into a rock band, and it did a pretty good job.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So we got the tech titans code and chords. Here's another take of the algorithm neural riot. Here's another one by the algorithms. So here Deis does not look like himself. Sundar looks pretty pretty much like what he's supposed to in every shot.

### 📋 セクション 50

It does seem like a Dems Hassabus sometimes doesn't quite look like himself and very often it adds a hair. I mean this is the input image. Notice he's got a very aerodynamic look. But the A model that he's in charge of developing is like oh let's give him hair. here.

### ⭐ セクション 51

He also has hair and also like looks like a younger version of himself. And in their debut rap album, Binary Beats, he's got a beanie on. There are some things that did not work too well. One of them is, if I wanted to be in the Django laughing meme. This was attempt number one.

### 📝 セクション 52

Not great. This was attempt number two. Also, I would say not great. And this was attempt number three. here just looks like it kind of cropped my face and just put it on top of the kind of the original shot and the original meme.

### 💡 セクション 53

Also, I'm just noticing is this what's happening in the background of the original? I' I've never noticed that. Okay, I guess so. I don't know. Did you notice that?

### 🔧 セクション 54

I' This is the first time I've I've actually noticed the background of this meme. Although, it does seem like it definitely filled in a lot of the details in the area. Uh it seems worse. And finally to measure kind of the multi-step changes that it's able to make. You know, we took this one.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Again, this is three images combined into one. And that was our original sort of first turn, first step. Since we were all in Vegas, I'd figure that the next sort of snapshot in time. That would make sense in Vegas would always be, you know, behind bars. I feel like it lost mine and Sam's likeness.

### 💭 セクション 56

Dylan and Elon, they're still looking the same. You can tell who they are. This was another attempt. Again, I feel like it's losing a lot of our likenesses. We're not really looking like ourselves.

### 📌 セクション 57

I can't help but notice that this sort of open sort of welcoming show stance that's supposed to be kind of friendly very much turns into this like what's up bro uh stance in jail, which I guess is fitting. Anyways, there's a lot a lot more, but I think I showed you the ones that are kind of showing you the power and also some of the things that maybe it's not so good at. But overall, it's incredibly incredibly impressive. Looks like it's going to get integrated with Google Ads, their e-commerce, merchant center, etc. I think it's going to be helpful there for generating various images, notebook, and you're going to be able to use a Gemini 3 Pro and use this image generation model to help build, for example, front-end designs or various UI elements for whatever software you're building.

### ✅ セクション 58

So, let me know what you thought about it. If you had a chance to test it out, tell me how it went. Are you overall impressed? Do you feel a little bit let down? Let me know.

### 📚 セクション 59

Also, if you have any idea why this model always generates demis with hair, also do let me know. Make sure you subscribe. We got big things coming down the line. My name is Wes Roth. Thank you so much for watching.

### 🔖 セクション 60

I'll see you in the next
