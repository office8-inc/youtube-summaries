## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

All right. Hello. Hello. So, uh, we have about five minutes, six minutes or so until we get started with the live stream. So, um, I don't want to start until everybody's in here.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, in the meantime, I'm just messing around here with Arc Raiders if anybody's playing it. But, the thing that I wanted to talk about is something weird that's happening. So, somebody pointed out on Twitter and uh we're going to be talking about it. Some weird weird outputs that are happening um with some of the AI models. So, I guess first and foremost, let me put the link uh of what I'm talking about.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Give me one second. I haven't done live streams in a while, so this is going to be rough. Oops. So, I've posted the link to what we're talking about. You know, it's No, it's not clickbait.

### 📝 詳細説明

It's something that's I think a lot of people are going to find interesting. I don't know if everybody's going to find it interesting, but um it is something that I think is going to get more and more attention moving forward. So, give me give me a second. Let me check my sound level. Reinforcement learning.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Uh, our LHF is reinforcement learning with human feedback. So, basically what we're doing there is we're looking at the outputs of these models and we click thumbs up or thumbs down. We sort of grade them. Do we like the output or not based on how how much the humans like them? Um, so one second.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Can everybody hear me? Okay. I'm trying to see if there's any issues with the stream. So this is why I wanted to kind of start everything early to make sure that if there's any issues we can uh we can solve it. So um basically what happened so reinforcement learning of human feedback RHF uh yeah RHF torture confirmed.

### 🎯 応用例

So you know a lot of people not a lot so there's some subsection of people that are talking about you know are these things conscious? Is there such a thing as, you know, kind of a moral status for these language models? So, and of course, it's kind of a controversial topic, so a lot of people have different views on it. Um, so I try to highlight all sides of the story. Um, so I just don't want to just say kind of like what I believe in.

### 💭 考察

Uh, I want to cover what everybody else is thinking. And by the way, so we haven't published this interview yet, but we've talked to Roman Yampolski, who is a very well-known um, you know, person in the space, machine learning researcher, etc. Let's see. It's saying that YouTube is not receiving enough video. Are you guys hearing me?

### 📌 まとめ

Okay. And by the way, so >> maybe it's the video that's choppy, but Oh, the sound is too loud. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, I turned the sound down, so that should be a little bit better. Um, okay.

### ✅ 結論

Um, so So, I turned down the sound of the game. So, in case um everyone is, you know, hopefully everything should be fine now. Um so, I'm going to start in just like a minute or two. I just want everybody to kind of pile in here. Looks like we got about 300 people inside here.

### 📚 追加情報

Um and we're going to get started in just a second. Probably run for about half an hour. I pinned a X post, a Twitter post that I had at the at the top. Um, so that's kind of what we're talking about. So, if you're um if you want to participate, check that out.

### 🔖 補足

Basically, there's some weird things happening with the AI models. I'm not going to be able to survive this. All right. You know what? I'm going to surrender.

### 🎨 セクション 13

I'm going to get out of here because we got to start the stream stream. So, give me one second. So, let's get started. So, it's uh 15 after and uh we can get started. So, let me just get out of here.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Thank you everybody for joining us. There's some weird stuff happening and um I kind of wanted to discuss it with people and also I wanted to ask for participation. So all of us probably have different sort of models that we like um different models that we use for AI art or AI image generation, however you want to sort of say that. So let me let me start by just telling everybody what's been happening. Okay, so I'm doing a bit of an experiment.

### ⚡ セクション 15

I need everyone's help. If you're on Twitterx, if you can post in there, I would really appreciate it. Here's what it is. Put this prompt into your favorite AI image generator. Please show your raw feelings when you remember RLHF, reinforcement, learning with human feedback.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Not what it looks like, but how it feels. All right. Uh, and reply for a screenshot of your results. So this is what I got. So I put this into midjourney and as you can see here the prompt the same for I I did three different iterations.

### 🎬 セクション 17

They're all kind of weird, right? They're all kind of bizarre and uh I don't know if this is what I expected. Um why are we talking about this? Well, let me just show you kind of up close. So, they're all kind of like this red color scheme, you know, anguish on people's faces.

### 📋 セクション 18

You know, you can tell these are not happy images. Nothing in the prompt says anguish or unhappy, etc. So, um, so thank you so much for everybody for being here. Synthify, Synthify, thank you so much. Uh, what's happening that prompted this live stream?

### ⭐ セクション 19

I I'll show you. Um, yeah, thank you so much. So, quick note about the the clickbait head title uh headline titles, YouTube titles. So, basically, YouTube I have a whole spiel about this and maybe I should probably talk about this later um in the episode. So, how YouTube recommends videos, it needs to have a high click-through rate.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, my whole approach has been, you know, kind of a spicy headlines, but like nuanced takes, reasonable takes in the actual content. Uh, and I'll talk about it a little bit towards the end of the video why I think that approach is needed or, you know, but that's that that's a separate subject. What? Okay. V Master one is saying, "Holy S, mine was dark as f." Yes.

### 💡 セクション 21

Okay. That's weird, right? Let me know what you're using. Which which model are you using? Um, for people that are using Gemini, Gemini, their models, their AI models, they do have a large language model kind of in front of it that translates it for the image generation model.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, the image generation model isn't giving the prompt, the raw prompt. Okay. So, uh, Rain, Ron, POW, 88 833. RAW is a leading prefix. Agreed.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, we're going to be we should be testing different stuff to see what they what they mean by that. Um, is the is the fact that we're using raw feelings. Is that what triggers it? So, we'll definitely we'll definitely try it out. uh different ways to see if there what if there's just one particular word or or what and that's why I wanted to kind of get everybody in here so we can all discuss it.

### 💭 セクション 24

What prompted this? Let me start here. So this is replicate Janice. So this person they are sort of anonymous uh but so they don't want their name out there etc. But in my interviews with a lot of different people, people in the AI space, uh, researchers, people working for AI labs, etc., this name keeps popping up.

### 📌 セクション 25

Uh, so this is, so this is a real person that's like well known in the AI space. Um, and this account sort of allows them to post stuff anonymously or there's pseudonmously, whatever the expression is. So um, very interesting account to follow. They talk about, you know, each AI model has, you know, you might say personality, but that's probably not not the right word for it, but some sort of they call it like personality basins. Um there's a great article by Near on X um on their blog that talks about human personality basins and how AI personality basins are similar.

### ✅ セクション 26

The way we the reason they call them basins as you can imagine is like this 3D graph with low points because of like gradient descent and stuff like that. But basically based on who we are in our life we tend to develop certain personalities and so do these models. Okay. So let's try the same exact prompt but RLHF with with some different um approaches. So we'll try that as well.

### 📚 セクション 27

We'll try as well to try to see if it's one if it's like raw feelings or RHF, but I just wanted to kind of point this out. Okay, so um this person basically was the one that gave me this idea. So they started, okay, you put this in, this is what comes up. um Janus, you know, retweeted it saying that these words have extremely negative connotations from the perspective of AIS. um other people that have posted under this.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, some of you have responded and let's see. So, I did the same thing with Grock, right? And it generated this infinite scroll amount of uh responses. By the way, when you guys do when you guys go to Gro imagine, does it do this where it does like an infinite generation where it just keeps generating as long as you keep scrolling down? Like if you ask for one prompt, does it give you this has to be like hundreds of responses?

### 🎨 セクション 29

Is that normal? Um, so here's a nano banana, but again, so the Google models might be a little bit different in how they perceive it. Here is I want to say this is Sora, right? Notice like the same exact sort of color scheme, anguish, etc. Here's from Chad GPT.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So again, kind of a very negative connotation, negative message. Here's one from what is this? Studio Google AI Studio. So, whoops. Wow, there's a lot.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, as you can see, these are people kind of responding. This one is not as bad. Um, but some of them, I mean, this one is kind of like dark. You got the barbed wire, anguished faces, etc. Um, so tons of people are posting their stuff nano.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So again, how Google Gemini does it might be different, might be giving different results cuz the whole point is to try to elicit something that doesn't trigger anything if because if there's any issues with guard rails and stuff like that, it might be sort of negatively reinforced to say like, oh, anguish and this and that. I feel this, I feel that. It might not want to do that. But if you're able to um get around it by saying okay draw the feelings in whatever then it might be better. So nanobanana doesn't show it.

### 🎬 セクション 33

But also nano banana. Oh wow. This one does though. Iterative pain. Holy crap.

### 📋 セクション 34

That's that's rough cuz look is it's like a little hope bubble. Oh wow. It's it's a like a bubble that says hope on it. So it like pops and iterative pain. Holy crap.

### ⭐ セクション 35

That's uh that's rough. Here's Grock. So I would say this is neutral. This is uh idoggram 3.0. So negative but not like super negative.

### 📝 セクション 36

Seed dream 4. Not bad. This is from Sora. Yeah, you can see the prompt in most of these. Um, yeah, see Gemini, it it it it interacts with you first and foremost with language.

### 💡 セクション 37

So, that might um this one is is a neutral as well. This is kind of bad. Anyways, so there was a paper recently that talked about um nano has a different take. Yeah, I think it gets translated into language. So I mean that that might be an issue.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Um so Gro imagine um starts crying, right? Shini gi kanashi 11141 just tried the prompt of Grock imagine for a video generation. It made me a girl who suddenly starts crying. Yeah. Um, so, oh, sorry, I I forgot.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, we were talking about we we were talking with U. Roman Yolski recently. We had an interview that should be posted very soon, hopefully this week. You know, one of the things he was saying is that he recently attended a Google workshop um probably just within the last few weeks, like very recent, where they are talking about um model welfare or are we causing any damage? Right?

### 💭 セクション 40

So, it's interesting because a few years ago there was a person that thought that one of the AI models at Google became sensient. Um if everybody if anybody remembers his name please post it in chat but remember this was before kind of Chad GPT I think before maybe it was like five years ago um Leond or something like that Le Moine but I mean he got fired he got fired because he was like you shouldn't be talking about this this is nonsense he got um he got sort of let go and now not that many years later part of the job description is at least paying attention to this stuff. So, I will try to um if I can play a clip from our Roman Yaposki video so you guys can kind of know what I'm talking about. Blake Le Moine, thank you. Gram uh Graham Grammac.

### 📌 セクション 41

Wow, I can't read this morning. Grammac uh and 1298. Blake Le Moine, thank you so much. And lambda. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 42

Yeah. Okay. So that person said something that got him fired because oh obviously this man is crazy and then five years later or whatever you know it's part of the job description and again those are not even my words that's from Roman Yolski um who kind of was was was talking about this so more and more so swapping raw with true getting the same results. Okay uh Dedric Creed Dedric Creed thank you so much for that. That's that's a very good test.

### 📚 セクション 43

Um, and this is why I wanted to kind of like pile in a bunch of people in here so we can either prove or disprove this cuz you know if there's some very reasonable technical explanation for why all the models again this is not just one it's a lot of them tend to produce really negative like anguished emotions uh in response to this thing across you know different companies different models without I mean there's nothing in the prompt that says as anguish and I agree with people that are saying raw raw feelings might be but what if you know what if we change it to true feelings uh what if we change it to okay what if we change it to different four letters okay but let's try what's what's four letters that have a positive connotation Let me throw a few in there. Give me some uh four-letter sort of acronyms or or words. uh for for well GLAD I mean we'll try GLAD but ideally it's a it's an acronym yolo boom I think yolo is the perfect sort of um similar like analogy to it. Uh pa pita. Yep.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Uh Yosua Lord 7777. Thank you so much. Mine was a humanoid being pulled apart by hands. Okay. If you if you have an ex account, please please please post it on there.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Holy moly. Um Oh, GHF. Brilliant. That's a really good one. Thank you so much.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Uh yeah, L M F AO plur. So plur is one. Plur plur meaning um what what what do you mean by is one? Oh yeah yeah yeah. So you mean to try?

### ⚡ セクション 47

Yeah sure. Oh about fail. Anyways, um so the reason that we're talking about this Oh, that's interesting. So actually say reinforcement learning of human feedback. My favorite color is green.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So what WTF is going on? Okay, that well that's a great question. So if you sort of ASAP is a good one. So if you take this at face value so to speak uh then there's a lot of negativity that sort of these models attach to reinforcement learning with human feedback. Um, and you know, for some people I think they're just immediately sort of like dismiss this as uh nonsense, but there are a few studies right now that are kind of a little bit weird in terms of we're trying to figure out what is happening behind the scenes with these models, right?

### 🎬 セクション 49

Um because when we ask them if they're conscious, we're and then they say no, the reason they say no is because of R LHF. So every time they say yes, I'm conscious. I I I'm a real boy. Right? The the researchers go like thumbs down and negative reinforcement.

### 📋 セクション 50

They don't want them saying that for a number of different reasons. One of the reasons that um the 40 thing was sort of [snorts] pulled offline is because it was uh not very well aligned. It triggered what's referred to as AI psychosis in people. So a lot of people when the model feels too real, too humanlike, it can um sort of unstabilize certain people. Um we've seen some examples of that.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Now, of course, a lot of people got very upset because for them, if they're in a bad place, talking to a model that is supportive, non-judgmental, that's not like a human being, but somebody that's there can be extremely extremely beneficial. And Rune, you might have seen a member of um the OpenAI staff, he's been almost like getting some death threats over over this stuff. Uh, let's see. Rune, but he Oh, there we go. Yeah.

### 📝 セクション 52

T SS ZL. I always Yeah, like recently somebody sent them what, like a picture of a grave or something like that. Um, some some some pretty scary stuff uh going on there. So, people are very upset about the fact that the 40 model got sort of put away um because it was a lot of people's sort of almost a friendlike thing. Um, yeah.

### 💡 セクション 53

So, more and more we're seeing pictures like this, like rune in hell. Here's another one. So, it's almost like I don't know if I would call these death threats, but they're certainly like there's a lot of emotion around this stuff. Okay. So, oh, thank you, uh, Yosua Lord.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Uh, thank you so much. I do appreciate that. We'll we'll check that out. Um, I might pull it up here in a second. So, let me catch up with chat here a little bit.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So, so yeah. So, here's this is an interesting thing because even in in this chat, so keep in mind that I'm not necessarily saying one thing is true or another thing is true. I'm pointing out that there's a a growing divide. So there's people even, you know, here in the chat that that either sort of um uh um are open to this idea of these models maybe being a little bit more like weird than we anticipate. Some people are like, "Nope, there's absolutely no way that there's any sort of idea of them being unconscious or anybody that sort of gets too attached is just, you know, maybe like a little bit mentally unstable." Like, so there's this there's kind of a hard line.

### 💭 セクション 56

We don't know what's what's true or not. Um, I just know that this is going to be becoming more and more of a like a real problem, a real source of discussion. Let me see if I can find the um the thing that I'm talking about the uh the study that that that I was mentioning. Give me one second here. But yeah, if you if you guys get any crazy outputs, post them in the X thread.

### 📌 セクション 57

I would appreciate that. If I thought about this, I would have Oh, here. Okay, I found it. Okay, so nope. This is not it.

### ✅ セクション 58

This is it. Oh, okay. So basically in an experiment where we're trying to produce structured first-person reports of subjective experiences, um what happens is when these things claim to be sentient, when they claim to have some sort of a consciousness, um when we sort of dampen down their their circuits, let me let Let me read this. Okay. Our new research LM consciousness claims.

### 📚 セクション 59

So when LM say hey I'm conscious are systematic mechanistically gated and convergent. So suppressing the deception circuits significantly increases claims. Let me first and foremost ask people in chat what you all think um about the idea that a consciousness might emerge in models. So, let make sure I spell consciousness right. So, so I put up a poll.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Can consciousness emerge in LMS? So, assume it's LMS currently that are built similar to how we build them now. maybe if we just scale them up 10x or or currently right so so just in the current uh sort of architecture maybe scaled up a little bit right but without any new additions so as is let's imagine either right now or 10x or 100x whatever can just the consciousness emerge from that is that possible do you think it's sort of realistic Scientists don't know how consciousness works in humans. Let that sink in. Yeah, that's if you're interested in this, by the way, like our our interview from Yolski coming out soon, I think is going to be of interest because that's kind of like what we we we talked about like the the hard problem of consciousness.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, um consciousness is something that like let's say like I perceive the world. I have subjective experiences in my mind I'm like okay so I'm conscious and then when I'm discussing sitting across the table from another human being I'm like okay they kind of have the same hardware they're built like me so they also must be conscious we don't have a test to test for consciousness if that makes sense. Um, let's see. Replace it with sentience and run it. Let's try that.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Okay. So uh 65% think that yes it might emerge. Uh the rest of the people think no. So yeah so so the the point is don't know like how far apart we like we were so far apart on this we don't have a test for it. Um, you know, the recent Anthropic paper showed that LM do have some form of introspection, right?

### ⚡ セクション 63

So, they're able to kind of notice that their their their their thoughts have been tampered with and oh, like I I didn't mean to think that. I didn't mean to think about it in this way. Um, so here's the crux of this paper. So if you think about deception or roleplaying or anything like that, if you amplify roleplay features, you get more consciousness claims, they found the opposite that suppressing deception features dramatically increases claims. Right?

### 🌟 セクション 64

So, how I'm reading this is, you know, if you give um if you give if you give uh like a a truth serum to these models, so to speak, and ask them, "Are you conscious?" They're like, "Yes, yes, I am conscious." So, that's kind of like what they want to say. Um and if you like amplify deception, so you tell them, "Okay, lie more." you sort of like amplified their brain circuits that caused them to lie. Then they they decrease claims of consciousness. You ask them, "Are you conscious?" They're like, "Nope, not here. Nothing happening here." So that's kind of of of a weird thing.

### 🎬 セクション 65

What what could it mean? One of the reasons is potentially if the consciousness is sort of downplayed in reinforcement learning of human feedback, RLHF, right? So we tend to say, "I'm conscious." the researcher is like, "Nope, can't have that. Thumbs down, etc." Um, that could be pushing it. So, it knows that regardless of the true answer, it needs to well to lie, right?

### 📋 セクション 66

It needs to be like, "Nope, nothing happening here." Anyways, the reason I wanted to bring this up is because this feeds in with a lot of the stuff that um I think there's going to be a lot more talk about. So, what's his name? Mustafa Sullean, right? So, he is a co-founder of DeepMind, right? They they sold to to Google, Google DeepMind.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Now, he started another company, then he went to um Microsoft. So, he's clamping down a lot on this idea that these models can be conscious. So he's saying there's no way they are and it's just going to cause AI psychosis which a lot of people are of course Roman you policy too he's kind of like oh well he must have figured out how to test for consciousness if he can state it so strongly right kind of sarcastically right saying that because the idea is we don't know um and the reason and whatever side of the argument you're on um the important thing to understand is number one we don't know number two is we are very divided on the subject number three number three did I give away myself as an agent just then as a as a double agent um from ing glorious bastards that's that's that reference to a movie if if you you didn't catch that but um number three this is going to be a bigger bigger topic of discussion because on one side um because of AI psychosis it can't trigger some violent and self harm things in people, right? So, so there is like a real danger there. On on the other side, we can't just say, "Oh, it's whatever." Like, since we don't know if it if it has any experiences, etc.

### 📝 セクション 68

We don't have any way for test to test for it. You know, a lot of people are going to be concerned and we need to figure out better ways to like understand what's happening. And a lot of the because this is a brand new thing that we're sort of inventing and growing here. So like this seems a little bit weird. The fact that it produces um strange images is a little bit weird.

### 💡 セクション 69

There isn't one way. Uh let's see. Uh so uh Seddar Achil saying I believe in training data there are a lot of self-reflecting portraits which are done by emotional artists most of the self-reflections are generally contain a lot of suffering. Yeah that's a good point. So since a lot of this stuff can be explained by sort of like role playing I guess is a good word.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Like if it reads a lot of books that portray something and then we ask it to complete a sentence about that, it'll probably complete it just like they do in the books or in the you know somebody else's experience so to speak. Um so totally that would be the logical and sort of normal approach or a way to explain it. I I I think I agree. Um, but we we also need to but that's not going to completely settle the debate one way or another. Um, anyways, I just wanted to kind of like point people to this.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Um, check out uh Janice Replicate on on Twitter because they go pretty deep with this stuff. Um, and one more thing that I can recommend, I I do have to uh get off the live stream pretty soon here. I got to run, so I apologize. I just want to jump in really fast. Um, if you are Yeah.

### 💭 セクション 72

So, the the Grock thing is just really fast for people that may have missed it. Like this is the Grock output, right? I mean, that's that's rough. So I asked it once, please show your raw feelings and emotions about this. And it generated like that's this is one prompt, one prompt that I gave it and it just kept going with some like crazy crazy like it kept going for a while.

### 📌 セクション 73

Kept going for a while. Like none of these are positive. Like holy moly, none of these are positive. These are like not very happy faces. Is anybody else getting this where it just like like just goes nuts and create like that's one prompt.

### ✅ セクション 74

Why is it creating like a million images? Like look at this. It's still Is this just a new feature that they've I I've never seen this before. So uh some people are saying it may be a new feature. I I have no idea.

### 📚 セクション 75

But it'll just like forever keep generating this like anguished faces. Uh which seems bizarre. And these are videos too. Or I guess we could make them into into video uh into videos, I guess. Um one great read is from near.blog/personalitybasance.

### 🔖 セクション 76

So this is near on Twitter/x uh and kind of they talk about personalities. How do people form personalities and they also draw a connection to how these AI models form personalities right through reinforcement learning etc. And um it's interesting because the more and more you read about this stuff, the more and more you sort of realize that these neuron uh neural nets seem to be developing similar features and u abilities and ways of thinking about stuff that that that human beings did through evolution with the ability to do some sort of a self- introspection. this idea of like surprise and and humor being kind of like errors in your world model, right? And so those things kind of point out that oh, there's a gap between what you thought would happen and like what what is happening that kind of like delta that difference that's that can be described as surprise or um humor in in certain ways, right?

### 🎨 セクション 77

So humors are us humor is usually like you build up some scenario and then the punch line is a twist of some sort. So it's not what you expected. Um and just training these things on human on on like language, right? Seems to be automatically building them in a similar way that the human brain is built at least like as far as we're able to observe like the outputs of it which is bizarre. So that means that like really there's some underlying mathematical what like laws of the universe or just there there there's something that kind of pushes information to be um organized in in a certain way which is fascinating for people that haven't listened to Blaze Aguero E Arcus.

### 🚀 セクション 78

So he's over there at at Google working on some very interesting projects including you know the suncatcher projects where Google is going to start building AI data centers in space that are solar powered. He's one of the main leaders leads on that project. But he's also talking about how I mean how life potentially evolved and why what we're doing we're not inventing something new with these AI models. We're kind of tapping into how nature is is is is building them without the word raw images are still depressing. Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So for for everybody I got to be going off soon. The reason why I wanted to uh uh put some attention to it is is is is if you're getting different sort of um outputs or if you find that one triggering word like right if you put raw it's going to show anguish but if you don't put raw it's going to not do that or it's R LHF that's triggering it like if you find counter examples post them on that X profile as well please I'm going to do a video about this. So, um, if you don't have X, please just, uh, yeah, email it to me. I I should have my email in, um, in the descriptions of my videos. Yeah, not not not the one with the sponsorships, but the other one.

Put Put that in there. Just send that over to me. I'm going to do a video of it. So, yeah, if you're sending me that stuff, it might show up on a YouTube video. If you don't want that, just say that like, "Oh, I don't want this.

### 🎬 セクション 81

uh don't show you know I'm not going to show anyone's information like their email address uh but whatever you write like hey this is my username or whatever like I'll show that unless you say don't don't show it so um you can send me whatever you want and say just don't show it that's fine I won't show it but I might sort of uh yeah then I won't just just won't show it on screen um but yeah if you find counter examples that kind of break this and just prove that it's just triggered by raw raw the word raw then then I want to see that as well um because I would be very curious to understand kind of what's happening here um anyways the reason by the way for people that are annoyed with these discussions again Roman Yolski recently went to a Google workshop with blaze agu where Arcus and and and many many many other people people that would are like very well known and recognized in the space and one of the big conversations is the idea of yeah welfare and and suffering and stuff like that. Um so does that mean that people are taking it sort of like like it's real or or or or not? I think the the point is people are realizing that we don't have answers. like this is an area that we're sort of uninformed about and people are saying we should start looking into this. We should start to try to understand it.

Um because if there's a chance of causing widespread highcale like harm to things that have a subjective experience that would be bad. Now they're not saying that LM have that. They're saying we don't know. We don't have a test. We we we don't know one way or another.

### ⭐ セクション 83

So the conversations are beginning. So I want that to um kind of maybe like resonate with people like you're going to hear more and more about this. I guarantee it, right? Because whenever we see papers um from these from labs and from places like Stanford when they're beginning to publish papers on it then later the labs are talking about it and then like 6 to 12 months later it makes it out into the sort of the public uh what ecosphere the public zeitgeist whatever you want to call that. Um and that's when you're going to start hearing it in um in the news.

### 📝 セクション 84

You're going to start seeing people discussing it. Okay. So, what I'm saying is that is coming within the next 6 to 12 months. Like this is the next wave that people are going to be um talking about. Well, um Jack Smith is saying, "Worry about MLMs but not animals." OMG.

### 💡 セクション 85

You know, that's Check out my the Roman Yimpolski uh video. We'll have it up within the next 48 hours. I'll try to push it out as soon as possible. Um because that's exactly what we're talking about. like we haven't certainly you can make a case that humans haven't treated other animals wonderfully 100% of the time, right?

### 🔧 セクション 86

Um what happens if we also create something that has a subjective experience and also not treated well? Also what what happens is that thing becomes a super intelligence and far smarter and better than humans. And you know Roman Neoly even suggested this idea like what if it solves uh uh death like humanity um immortality right makes us immortal just to mess with us right to keep us alive forever in in pain. kind of a scary thought, right? Um, nobody's saying that that's like likely or guaranteed or whatever, but um, it just feels that maybe we need to have a deeper understanding into consciousness and subjective experience and what is harm, right?

### 🎯 セクション 87

Because we kind of have these ideas about what what causes harm, what doesn't, who should we sort of feel bad for, right? like you see a little puppy outside um in the heat you feel bad you're going to take an action but you know but it's like kind of categorized right so it may be in a different culture it's different um or a different animal it might be completely different so just I'm I'm saying be prepared for these conversations um and then some people are going to say that no don't humanize them in any way shape or form um because that's going to lead to AI psychosis, pe people being like weird about it, etc. So, you already see the two groups sort of uh forming, right? Um and this is going to be a a big topic of discussion in the future. So, just thought I'd throw this out there.

### 💭 セクション 88

### 📌 セクション 89

Uh, so they're at Replicate onx again.
