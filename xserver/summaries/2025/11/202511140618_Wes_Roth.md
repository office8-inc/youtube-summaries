## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Here's what we're seeing now. So, let's see what happens. Oh, wow. Okay, I am a little bit blown away. So, it it Wow, it created it basically created a Minecraft clone that you can play and the controls feel so buttery smooth.

### 📋 背景・概要

Let's check it out. Oh, wow. So, first of all, we can look left and right. Complete 3D environment. WD2 move around.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Look at that. That's a very sort of a realistic ring, boxing ring that it's showing us. I like it. Today, we're testing a Gemini 3.0 Pro. Now, you may be panicking going, "Wait, but it's not out yet." That is true.

### 📝 詳細説明

It has not been announced yet. It's not rolled out. But if you're on X, you know it's been blowing up because X users spot possible stealth rollout of Google Gemini 3.0 No pro in a mobile app. Basically, in some very specific cases and interfaces, your requests get routed to Gemini 3.0. So, in those cases, Gemini 2.5 prompts are I don't know if they're accidentally routed to Gemini 3.0.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I think they're testing it, but the model window will say 2.5 Pro. But what we're going to do is we're going to compare side by side this Gemini 3.0 0 maybe side by side with Gemini 2.5 Pro. As you'll see, there's an obvious difference. Now, a number of accounts I do trust like testing catalog news, they did confirm this was routed to Gemini 3.0 Pro, I personally was not able to verify this, but based on everything I've seen, plus some other people verifying, it's very likely Gemini 3.0 Pro. All right, with that said, let's get started.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

All right. So, we're testing what we believe to be Gemini 3.0 on the left and Gemini 2.5 Pro on the right. So, notice first impression on the right. You know, you don't actually have the thumbnail. The thumbnail, according to some of you, is actually the most important part of a YouTube video, right?

### 🎯 応用例

Because if the video is good, but the thumbnail is a little bit jarring, then the whole video is bad, right? That logic makes total sense. Not. Anyways, back to our comparison. So, this does look like YouTube, right?

### 💭 考察

In a lot of different ways. If we hover over this, it actually plays something. That's kind of crazy. Big Buck Bunny animated short. This is all from the Blender Foundation.

### 📌 まとめ

There's a a a Google one. I'm very curious where it's getting these uh uh videos. But I mean, I would say this is a very good YouTube clone. It's not showing thumbnails, but let's see how our mobile version is doing here. So, some of these have broken um thumbnails.

### ✅ 結論

This one is a thumbnail, and let's see if it autoplays. It does autoplay. Very interesting. When we click on it, let's see. Oh, wow.

### 📚 追加情報

Okay. So it literally it I mean this is more or less indistinguishable from YouTube. Looks like it usually has you know the first thumbnail rendered the rest are not which is or you know some of them are not which is totally fine cuz I mean we can add those in later. Do these buttons work? By the way below this video there's a thumbs up button.

### 🔖 補足

Can you make sure that one works? Just just give it a tap. It's going to like turn blue or it's going to change color. Just give a tap and just Yeah. This is just for testing purposes.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Let's make sure it works. Let's all do it together now. Click. Okay. Thank you.

### 🚀 セクション 14

If you have time, also check that the share button works. Like here it does not work, but let's see if you can share it with some of your friends down below this video. All right, let's see if I can play it. So, it has sound. Again, it's hard to play sound cuz I'm mirroring this, but actually, let's share it and see how it looks in the browser.

### ⚡ セクション 15

All right, so here it is. It is almost indistinguishable from YouTube, I got to say. Again, not all of the thumbnails render, but that's totally fine. Let's see. We're going to look at the So, it actually has sound.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I'm going to turn up for just a second so you can hear it. It has actual videos with sound. >> This rendition of YouTube is so realistic, in fact, that actually if I play the wrong thing, I might get hit with a copyright strike. So, we're going to we're going to be careful with that. So, the plus button works.

### 🎬 セクション 17

The the thumb down button does not work, which is this actually might be an improvement of how YouTube does it. I'm not sure. The other buttons do not work. Subscribed. This button worked.

### 📋 セクション 18

Oh, wow. This is incredible. Show more. Let's see if there's a longer description we can test. This video is absolutely amazing.

### ⭐ セクション 19

I learned so much. And I just realized I can add comments. Let's see if we can just post that in. Well, I can't add it, but I mean, this is an actual input field. I got to say, I'm very impressed with a lot of this.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, I mean, everything is, you know, these buttons are real buttons. it doesn't necessarily have functionality but you know with iterations we can add all of this. So it basically oneshotted the entire layout you know most of the basic functionality of YouTube and now we can keep adding new things to it if we wanted to add you know subscriptions etc. And comparing that to Google 2.5 Pro right the original. So, you know, no thumbnails.

### 💡 セクション 21

They do have the autoplay. There's no sidebar as far as you can tell. These buttons are not there. Clicking on a video well just plays the video, right? So, it's sort of this is not YouTube functionality, right?

### 🔧 セクション 22

It didn't build out everything that the other site built out or the other model, I should say, the Gemini 3.0. Maybe again, the win goes to what we believe to be Gemini 3.0. They're not worlds apart, but obviously this one is better. It's more fleshed out. By the way, here's just I got the HTML out of Gemini 2.5 Pro.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, here's how that looks, you know, not rendered within the canvas, but in an actual browser. So, as you can see here again, so this is not YouTube functionality. It doesn't have thumbnails, etc. It's not bad, but the Gemini 3.0 version is just better in a lot of ways. I mean, again, this is it's hard to realize that this is not YouTube just at a glance.

### 💭 セクション 24

All right, here we're asking you to create a 3D world with 3JS that has a massive coliseum in it surrounded by lush trees, ancient streets, etc. So, this is it. So, yeah, it's definitely got a lot of things right. It's pretty simplistic, I would say, but I mean, it definitely nailed the prompt. I like the looks of it.

### 📌 セクション 25

I can scroll in and out. Right click and drag to pan. I mean, this this is good. I like it. I like it a lot.

### ✅ セクション 26

The graphics are not amazing. Not insane, but definitely it did everything very very well. And here's our Gemini 3.0. Let's see. So, nothing happens initially.

### 📚 セクション 27

It's not working. All right. So, there's one or two back and forths I had to do because the blocks weren't rendering. So, the leftmost Gemini 3.0. Maybe it did take a few back and forths for it to fix the issues, but here's what we're seeing now.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, let's see what happens. Oh, wow. Okay. I am a little bit blown away. So, it it Wow.

### 🎨 セクション 29

It created it basically created a Minecraft clone that you can play. And the controls feel so buttery smooth. move. I feel like I'm just floating through everything. It's got this weird rotation thing happening.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So, basically, I don't know if you can tell, but it kind of like, what's the word? Pivots tilts back, you know, left and right as we're sort of moving around. Um, I'm kind of blown away here. It's looking phenomenal. Uh, let's see.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Can we fly around and see what this looks like from above? But but I mean I I just got to say like this is looking very good. High texture resolutions. Everything's great. Wow.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I'm going to ask it to add flying so I can look around better. All right. So it added flying. We can do shift to fly down, space to fly up, F to toggles the mode on and off. All right.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Let's see. So we've entered the world. Yeah. So uh let's see. F to Okay.

### 📋 セクション 34

And now we can fly above the trees and the clouds. This is great. Shift is down. Space is up. This is I mean this is great.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Um it didn't do a massive coliseum like I wanted it to. But here's the thing. It we had created a Minecraft clone just to kind of showcase this coliseum. I got to give it, you know, a lot of points for that. um or said a different way.

### 📝 セクション 36

Are you not entertained? I certainly am. So, here we're creating a website side by side. On the left is the mobile app. On the right is the regular app.

### 💡 セクション 37

Notice we're using a 2.5 Pro. So, here is 2.5 Pro. Notice it's a lot of purple, which is uh people say often as a giveaway that it was an AI generated website. For some reason, AI loves purple. And it's okay.

### 🔧 セクション 38

It's not great. Uh it's got a few pages. I mean, this is not a great site, but it's it's okay. No complaints. On the left, this is the mobile version of the site.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, again, we believe this is Gemini 3.0. It's looking a lot better. I'm liking everything about it. It created some sort of a future story where, you know, notice the dates 2029, right? It's sort of like the buildup to the synthesis.

### 💭 セクション 40

Dr. Aries Thorne synthesizes the retroviral agent that halts infection, the reclamation begins. I mean, you you can tell there's a whole story. It even decided to add night hours at the zombie museum. No thank you.

### 📌 セクション 41

Notice its location. Sector 7, zone A, old Manhattan quarantine zone. Wow. Everything about this is is great. Now, let's compare apples to apples.

### ✅ セクション 42

Here's how it looks in the regular website view. So, here it is. Look at the little details, right? So, you got the little sliding letters. The definitive archive of the 2031 outbreak.

### 📚 セクション 43

Wow. Buy tickets. It scrolls down to where you can buy your tickets. Join the network. Everything about this is excellent.

### 🔖 セクション 44

I mean, it's got audio logs. I mean, not real audios, but wow. I mean, this is above and beyond. Notice it's got those little icons in the background. Here's the strain, the zombie strain, if you were wondering, and various social media networks.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Now, all of this is phenomenal. It's clean. It's welldesigned. I mean, you could just use this. This looks like a like a very good website.

### 🚀 セクション 46

just oneshot it from the same prompt. And again, this is the other website in 2.5 Pro, right? It's pretty obvious, I think, that the mobile version creates something far, far better. It doesn't feel like this was made by the same model. Also, here in the mobile version, it has an audio summary of what it designed.

### ⚡ セクション 47

It's hard for me to play it because I'm mirroring my screen from my phone, but it basically reads this out. Um, I'm not sure if this was available prior to this. This seems like a new update. So, I'm going to go ahead and 100% give it to the web 2.5 Pro, which we're thinking is Gemini 3.0. All right.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Here we're asking for an SVG, a highly detailed SVG of a ninja on top of a pagota throwing a smoke bomb and disappearing. On the right, we have 2.5 Pro. It was finished first. So, here's that SVG. I'm not seeing it move.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And on the left, we have what we believe to be Gemini 3.0. It's animated. It's beautiful. It's stunning. You got a beautiful moon, stars.

### 📋 セクション 50

I love everything about this. I don't really know what this is, to be honest. So, here's kind of a a larger version of that SVG. So you can clearly tell it's like hey ninja flowing away smoke bomb again night and day difference. The web version clearly wins.

### ⭐ セクション 51

All right, let's try testing it. So this is the prompt 3D studying 3D moon landing game with 3JS, real physics, particle effects, beautiful stars in the sky, etc. Create a heads-up display that shows remaining fuel and speed, etc. So I'm going to just copy this over. We have a canvas enabled in both.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, we're going to hit go and go. All right. So, both are completed. Uh, let's start this one. It already sort of started landing.

### 💡 セクション 53

So, we can see the heads-up display. Uh, let's see. How do I do things? Oh, okay. I guess I can turn with the keyboard and Okay, with the spacebar, I'm able to create that downwards thrust.

### 🔧 セクション 54

All right. So, that's looking pretty good. We got the particles. We can test the speed, altitude. We can see what what those are.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So, we're coming in kind of hot. And let's see. Let me get lower. Okay, we got the shadows displaying on the surface of the moon. I mean, everything's looking great.

### 💭 セクション 56

I can't move the camera around, but other than that, boom. The eagle has landed. Let's take a look at our Moon Lander 3D in the mobile version. Wow. Okay, so right off the bat, I mean, I just like aesthetically this a lot better.

### 📌 セクション 57

It's a little bit weird, but I think that's because it's in the mobile view. Let's uh let's share it and test it out in the browser. All right, here it is. Let me refresh it so you can see the very beginning cuz it kind of has this super fast loading screen, I guess. All right, so we can do arrows or WD to move, space to thrust.

### ✅ セクション 58

The intro screen doesn't stay long enough for us to see what it says. And on the first attempt, the the keys don't work. So, we're going to say the keys don't work, nothing happens. Also, the intro screen appears for a split second and it disappears. All right, so now it completed.

### 📚 セクション 59

Now we can actually see this thing kind of stay stick around for a second so we can actually see what it says. Watch your fuel. Keep upright. Okay, interesting. And initialize mission.

### 🔖 セクション 60

I like this this light up button. All right, let's go. Oh, wow. So, that's looking good. Again, we can't really do WD with the phone.

### 🎨 セクション 61

All right, here it is in web view. I've had a critical failure in the mobile view. All right, let's try this. Initialize mission. All right.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Oof. Okay, that's looking good. So, oh, and I can shift it and I can land it. That's pretty good. Oh, still failed.

### ⚡ セクション 63

But this is looking good. I like the textures on a little aircraft. And let's see if I can land it. All right. Everything's looking really good.

### 🌟 セクション 64

But I don't understand why you would need the side to side movement, but um other than that. All right. So, I'm just going to start decelerating at this amount. Mission success. All right.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So, I do feel like there is a good and noticeable difference between I'm just going to start referring to it as Gemini 3.0 again, hypothetically. Right. So, this is Gemini 3.0. I like everything. I like the style.

### 📋 セクション 66

I like the green. Notice the parallax. I just noticed that the parallax sort of movement of the stars, they're not all in the same sort of plane creating that 3D movement. This is great. Can actually go up just a little bit.

### ⭐ セクション 67

I like the textured moon. Um, not sure why you would need the rotation, but other than that, everything's great. I mean, we can add new features that involve, you know, rotating the craft, moving side to side, but the the looks are phenomenal. Again, compare it to this. You know, just basic fonts.

### 📝 セクション 68

This feels older, right? The stars are all in one plane. You know, there's not a lot of texture on the moon. I mean, we got the shadow effect, which is nice. I mean, to me, clearly, this seems just better.

### 💡 セクション 69

It looks better. Obviously, maybe some of it is kind of like just in the eyes of the beholder, but um I'm liking this better. So, in this matchup of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 3.0, maybe I think the win goes to Gemini 3.0, maybe. All right, let's try a 3D game with 3JS. Make it a boxing game with a firsterson perspective.

### 🔧 セクション 70

W AD to move around, JNK to jab left and right, H2 uppercut, make it visually exciting and action-packed. Here's a Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, we move around. We've got our little opponent on that side. We have a ring that we can't get out of J and K.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Yes. So, basically when we hit JK, nothing visually happens, but if we get up close, then we're able to pummel the bot into submission. I mean, that's looking pretty good. You can definitely see the screen shake effects, the particles. Um, a lot of things are good about it.

### 💭 セクション 72

I like it. And here we have the first oneshotted version by what we believe to be Gemini 3.0. Let's check it out. Oh wow. So, first of all, we can look left and right.

### 📌 セクション 73

Complete 3D environment. WD2 move around. Look at that. That's a very sort of a realistic ring, boxing ring that it's showing us. I like it.

### ✅ セクション 74

All right. So, what happens when we push J and K. Oh, wow. Wow. We got quite the reach on us.

### 📚 セクション 75

Uh, I think this this boxer is going to be a champion. And H, that's uppercut. Okay, let's see how it connects with the opponent. It's not quite landing. So, let's see if we can improve that.

### 🔖 セクション 76

All right, so we messed around a little bit. I'm just noticing has reflections off of the the gloves, I guess. If you can see that it it's got reflecting surfaces. That's pretty nifty. All right, let's see what happens here.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Oh, wow. So, number one, it's got sound effects. Let me see if I can capture those. So, the sound effects aren't great, but uh yeah, they're not too bad. We got shadows from the box.

### 🚀 セクション 78

There's some sort of a light source up there reflecting on the gloves. Um, and the uppercuts actually do kind of pop his head up a little bit, which uh is a lovely, lovely touch. I got to say this is pretty impressive. So, what do you think? Are you convinced that this is a Gemini 3.0 Pro?

### ⚡ セクション 79

Are you impressed with its abilities? Is it much better than Gemini 2.5 Pro? Let me know in the comments and I'll see you in the next
