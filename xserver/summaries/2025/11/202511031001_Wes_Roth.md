## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, there's some breaking news in the case of Elon Musk versus Sam Alman. Ilia Setscover's deposition has been made public. So, as we're approaching the 2-year anniversary of Sam Alton being fired from OpenAI briefly, the board of directors for OpenAI was accused of doing a coup. The whole thing was incredibly confusing and no one really knew what was happening. Sam was informed of his removal 5 to 10 minutes before it occurred.

### 📋 背景・概要

The only explanation that was given to him and also to to us the public was that Sam Alman was not consistently candid in his communications. Emmit Sheir who's the founder of Justin TV aka Twitch became the CEO of OpenAI temporarily. We also believe that there were talks to transfer OpenAI under the anthropic umbrella to merge the two companies somehow with Anthropic taking over. Here's what we didn't know. Ilia plotted for over a year with Meera to remove Sam.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So this has been brewing in the background for a long time before we heard about it. Dario wanted Greg fired and himself in charge of all research. This is Dario Amade. He used to work for OpenAI. This is Daario Amade.

### 📝 詳細説明

He was one of the people at OpenAI working there. Eventually left and started Anthropic. This is Greg Brockman, president of OpenAI. It sounds like Ilia had a 52-page memo to get Sam fired and a separate document on Greg Brockman. And this is quite honestly just scratching the surface.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Let's take a look. So this is Musk v. Altman Ilia Sutskcover deposition on October 1st, 2025. It's recently been made public. So really fast.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Other than Ilia Sudskver, there's attorneys present in the room. Attorney Agenol Luchi and attorney Molo. and they are basically going to war with each other. At some point they have to take a fiveinut break because it seems like the situation is getting heated. So a lot of this is them fencing with each other trying to block each other out.

### 🎯 応用例

It's highly entertaining, but for the sake of time I'm going to just skip over that and just get to what we're interested in specifically. What did I see? So Ilia sends his 52-page memo to the independent directors of the board. So here's sort of the the cast, if you will, the board of opening eye at the time. We had Ilia Suskver, we had Helen Toner, Adam D'Angelo, and Tasha Macaulay.

### 💭 考察

And of course, we have Sam Alman and Greg Brockman. They are the CEO and president, and this is their board. So the lawyer asks Ilia, "Why did you send it to the independent directors and not to the entire board?" Ilia says, "Because we were having the discussions with the independent directors only." Why didn't you send it to Sam Alman? Ilia, because I felt that had he become aware of these discussions, he would just find a way to make them disappear. Wow, that's quite a start.

### 📌 まとめ

Ilas asked if he was careful about what he included in the document. He says, "Yeah, he was pretty careful. Most of the screenshots that he had, most or all of them he got them from Mera Miati. So this of course was Mirror Miati Samalman Ilia Greg and this is Yakob Yakob Bachoki. He will make an appearance later.

### ✅ 結論

So these are all sort of like the higher-ups at OpenAI at the time. Currently both Ilia and Meera stepped out to create their own startups. And who asked Ilia to prepare this memo? It was most likely Adam D'Angelo. Seems like Adam asked Ilia for some sort of screenshots.

### 📚 追加情報

So, they're not too specific about what they were talking about, but they were putting this memo about Sam Alman. And the people involved were Adam, Helen Toner, Tasha Macaulay, and Iliac. And what was in that memo? Well, the very first page says the following. Sam exhibits a consistent pattern of lying, undermining his execs, and pitting his execs against one another.

### 🔖 補足

Ilia confirms that is correct. Is this what Ilia said to the independent directors? That's correct. Were they concerned about this? They were.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Did you want them to take some sort of actions based on what you wrote? Says he wanted them to be aware of it. And his opinion was that action was appropriate. So it seems like based on this, Ilia and the board were seeing a problem. They wanted some actions taken.

### 🚀 セクション 14

What actions should have been taken? According to Ilia, termination. You send this memo using a form of disappearing email. Yes. So basically, Ilia was worried that these will somehow leak.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So he used a disappearing email to try to reduce the chance of it leaking. Did I draft a similar memo about Greg Brockman? Yes. Did he send that to the board as well? Yes.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So this gets a little bit interesting because this is kind of the first part where these two lawyers kind of go head-to-head. The thing that they're fighting about is the memo about Greg Brockman. As far as I can tell, right now, we don't have this memo about Greg Brockman, but it seems like the courts have ordered it for discovery. So, something to keep an eye out for. Maybe potentially in the future this memo will become public as well.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Then there's like three pages of the two attorneys duking it out. Next, they're talking about the Saturday after Sam Alman was fired. So the day after he was fired and Ilia's asked, "Were you concerned about losing your equity in OpenAI at the time?" There's yet another page or two of these attorneys fighting. Ilia declines to answer. He says, "I have to obey my attorney." So the attorney suggests not to put a monetary value on it or answer that question.

### 📋 セクション 18

So this paper kind of jumps around a little bit. Some of it looks like it's redacted. We don't have access to all of it. So here we come in on Ilia Sutsk answering a question. We're not sure which question, but he's talking about AGI.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And so he's saying right now my view is that with very few exceptions, most likely a person who is going to be in charge is going to be very good with the way of power and it will be a lot like choosing between different politicians. The person in charge of what AGI Gile is saying, well that's just how the world seems to work. It's not impossible, but I think it's very hard for someone who would be described as a saint to make it. He's saying, I think it's worth trying. I just think it's like choosing between different politicians.

### 📝 セクション 20

Who is going to be the head of state? So, I see this as him saying the people that end up on top and running things tend not to be saints. As he says it, the lawyer follows up saying, "Looking back at this process, the process of the removal of Sim and Greg from the board, what's your assessment of the process?" He clarifies, saying, "You've had a time to reflect on the process that preceded the removal." Ilia says, "Yes." Do you think that process was correct? Ilia saying, "One thing I can say is that the process was rushed. Why?

### 💡 セクション 21

I think it was rushed because the board was inexperienced. Inexperienced in board matters." Next, he confirms that he didn't interact with Helen Toner too frequently and neither did he interact with Tasha Macaulay too frequently. Next, the attorney saying Helen Toner was associated with open philanthropy at some point. So, from what we know, there's some ties with EA, effective altruism, open philanthropy, etc. Ilia says, "I have a vague knowledge of that." The attorney continues, "And is open philanthropy in turn associated with Holden Karnnowski?" So Holden Koski according to Wikipedia co-founded the grantmaking organization Open Philanthropy.

### 🔧 セクション 22

He also joined Anthropic. He married Daniela Amade who is the sister of Daario Amade and you know they're all at anthropic and he identifies with the ideas of EA effective altruism. So Ilia confirms yes. So they are associated and he is married to Daniela Amade. Daario and Daniellea are brother and sister and they're both with Anthropic.

### 🎯 セクション 23

He says, "Well, he's not sure, but he he believes that that that that has been the case." Dolor continues saying, "Do you recall in October 2023, Helen Toner publishing an article criticizing open AI? We read some of that article on this channel. If I recall correctly, she was giving praise for various AI rollouts from Anthropic. how it's handled well with safety in mind and yeah you could say criticizing open AI and how they handled the rollouts of Chad GBT and others. So, Ilia says, "Yes, I don't recall the exact nature of the criticism, but I recall it praising Anthropic." And what was his reaction to that article?

### 💭 セクション 24

He found it to be a strange article. It was a strange thing for her to do. Question: Do you think it was appropriate for her to do this as a board member of OpenAI? Ilia says, "I thought it was not far from obviously inappropriate." Question: Did you discuss with anyone the prospect of Helen being asked to leave the board at that time? Ilia says yes.

### 📌 セクション 25

So this is something that I don't think anybody knew. So Halen did sort of praise Enthropic criticize OpenAI while being on the board of open AI. It did seem weird. Ilia discussed this issue with Sam and it seems like Ilia at some point expressed support for perhaps asking Hela Toner to leave the board. Question.

### ✅ セクション 26

after Sam was removed. Do you recall Helen Toner telling employees that allowing the company to be destroyed would be consistent with the mission? Ilia says, "I do recall. It happened when the executives were meeting with the board members. The executives told the board that if Sam does not return, then Open EI will be destroyed and that's inconsistent with Open Ei's mission." Helen Toner said something to the effect of that it is consistent, but I think she said it even more directly than that.

### 📚 セクション 27

Ilia is asked, "Do you think this would be consistent with the mission?" Ilia says, "I could imagine hypothetical extreme circumstances where the answer would be yes." But at that particular point in time, you know, November 2023, the answer was definitely no for him. So, this is interesting. It sounds like they were all kind of on the same page. Let's remove these two people because of what we talked about in the memo. Let's try to get somebody that we perceive as being more aligned to the mission.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And it almost seems like one of the board members goes, "And now that we got rid of Sam Alman, now we can finally destroy OpenAI from within." Which probably came as a shock to everyone else cuz they're like, "That was not the plan. Where are you getting these ideas?" Cuz again, she's publishing papers that criticize Open EI while being on Open EI's board. She's praising the competition as Ilia himself says, right? So it it was close to being obviously inappropriate. So that was probably a red flag.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And then when she's saying that they should destroy Open Eye, that was probably another red flag. Next, they talk about a document that Ilia talked to Mirram Miat about potentially. And in that document, they're talking about that Sam was removed in the past from Y Combinator for a similar reasons that that Ilia identified in the document. Ilia confirms yes. and they read from the document.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Sam was pushed out from YC Y cominator for similar behaviors. He was creating chaos, starting lots of new projects, pitting people against each other and thus not managing YC very well. Ilia also confirms that Meera told him this piece of news that Greg has essentially fired from Stripe as well. The attorneys want to understand if Ilia verified this information or simply believed Meera that she told them the truth. Ilia saying, "I fully believed the information that Meera was giving me.

### ⚡ セクション 31

It didn't occur to him to verify it with with Greg, for example." There's another section called lying to Meera about Jason's opinion about the DSB. So DSB from this context there's some sort of a a checklist that has to be followed for AI safety before a new model is released. So maybe it stands for deployment safety board. I'm not sure but some sort of an internal review for AI safety of a new model before release. They mention Jason Quan from OpenAI.

### 🌟 セクション 32

There are references in the document to Jason Quan who might have been the general counsel at the time. So just really fast since this doesn't spell it out. So some of it is redacted so we don't know exactly but and this is kind of my speculation but it's based on all the other stuff that I' I've read regarding to this event. Basically the turbo matter that's the release of a GPT4 turbo. Helen Toner seemed to have issues with how these models were rolled out.

### 🎬 セクション 33

She in her interview talked extensively about the fact that Chad GBT was published without the board being notified. Now of course the other side so when other people kind of talk about they say well no one knew how big Chad GBT would be. it was just another sort of incremental release of of their models. So, of course, they're not going to notify the board of every single release. So, it sounds like this whole conversation is about the fact that Meera was lied to about Jason's opinion about the DSB, the safety checklist.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, Jason was the general counsel. So, here the lawyer that's doing the questioning. So, he's kind of saying, "Well, did you actually speak to Jason about this?" And says, "No. Do you know whether in fact Jason was disturbed by his discussion with Sam Alman about this? Ilia is saying well I got this information from Meera and I believed it.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Do you know whether GPT4 Turbo actually went through the the safety checklist or no? Ilia says I don't know. Do you know whether Sam supported or opposed it going through the DSB? IA saying in hindsight I realized that I didn't know it but back then I thought I knew it but I knew it through secondhand knowledge. Have you learned any new facts that have changed your view?

### 📝 セクション 36

No. Now, so Ilia is saying he's learned the critical importance of firstand knowledge for matters like this. And he believes that basically if he has secondhand knowledge, it's an invitation for further investigation. So meaning that if you hear somebody say something, you should confirm that it's true. So we're not sure what what point exactly this has.

### 💡 セクション 37

So was it true? Was it not true? Did somebody lie about something? We're not quite sure. They also mentioned that Ilia in his document suggests that the board may want to talk to certain people like Bob Mcgru and Nick Ryder.

### 🔧 セクション 38

He's not sure if the board members actually talk to those people or not. Next section is pitting people against each other. One example is Daniela versus Meera. So Daniela Amade versus Meera Miat. Who told you Sam pitted Daniellea against Meera?

### 🎯 セクション 39

Mera did in the section below where it says Daario versus Greg and Ilia. And then they read from the paper, Sam was not taking a firm position in respect to Daario's wanting to run all of research at OpenAI and to have Greg fired. So the lawyer is trying to understand, so what was the issue with that? Ilia is saying he wrote that because he was faulting Sam for not accepting or rejecting Daario's conditions. So basically if Dario wanted Greg fired and he wanted to take over the research right by by doing that it would s sort of resolve the issue or telling him no that's not happening would also resolve the issue.

### 💭 セクション 40

Ilia didn't like the fact that Sam didn't either accept or reject that proposal. Next question is do you think Dario's conditions were fair? Ilia is saying his overall sense is that they were not fair and that Sam should have rejected them outright. Next, they talk about Yakob, Jakob Pachoki. And the read from the document involves Sam lying, undermining Meera, undermining Ilia, and pitting Yakob against Ilia.

### 📌 セクション 41

Joint work with Greg and YaKob. So, the lawyer's asking what was the lying in that case? Ilia is saying, "Well, Sam was telling me and YaKob conflicting things about the way the company should be run." The attorney says, "And you perceive that as lying, which just triggers a meltdown of these two lawyers?" Once they settle down, the next question is something titled subtle retaliation response to Mera's feedback. They mention that there's someone named Diane Yun and she was present for meetings with Mirror and Sam. Did I talk to Diane Yun about these events?

### ✅ セクション 42

Ilia says no. Why not? It didn't occur to him. And Ilia also doesn't recall any discussions that any of the other board members had with those individuals. Correct.

### 📚 セクション 43

A lot of the things here seem to be the lawyer basically trying to confirm like, okay, so you wrote all this stuff based on hearsay, I guess, is is the right word. Like Meera told you this, this other person told you that. And then following up by asking, did you ever confirm? Did you ever go to the source? Did you have somebody else confirm that this was in fact true?

### 🔖 セクション 44

Cuz there were other people that could have confirmed or denied it. So far it seems like Ilia is saying for most of these or maybe all of them that no he has not followed up and a lot of this is sort of the second hand knowledge so to speak. Next they're asking if during that time any board member received outside outreach from anthropic Ilia saying he didn't hear anything but he he's heard speculations but not anything definitive. Do you know whether a proposal was made around that time for opening eye to merge with anthropic? Ilia says, "I do not know that.

### 🎨 セクション 45

I don't know whether it was Helen who reached out to Anthropic or whether Anthropic reached out to Helen, but they reached out with a proposal to be merged with OpenAI and take over its leadership." This was on Saturday. This was the day after the removal of Sam and Greg. So that happened either Saturday or Sunday. So either within 24 or within 48 hours of the removal of Sam and Greg, Anthropic has a proposal to merge the two companies. How do we know about this?

### 🚀 セクション 46

Well, there was a board call with Helen and the other board members where she told us about it. There have been a subsequent call with the leadership of Anthropic. Ilia was there for the call and he recalls Enthropic expressing their excitement about it and expressing the issue, the practical challenges that they would have with it. Who was in the call? Well, it was Dario Amade and Daniela Amade.

### ⚡ セクション 47

There might have been maybe one more person he doesn't recall. Ilia was unhappy about it. He did not want OpenAI to merge with Anthropic. He just didn't want to. He doesn't give a specific explanation, but he just didn't want that to happen.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Were the other board members supportive? They were a lot more supportive. Yes. None were unsupportive, right? So, nobody was against it.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Who was the most supportive? It was Helen that was the most supportive. Again, keep in mind she's the one that's criticizing OpenAI praising Anthropic. She's the one that's saying that maybe OpenAI should be destroyed. So certainly if you believe that your company, your entire equity, that your entire net worth is about to be destroyed and then you get this offer to be taken over by a different company.

### 📋 セクション 50

Certainly that might be seen as a way out. At least that would make sense if she wanted to create the the merger. But you know, again, we have no idea. So why didn't the proposal go through? Ilia saying his recollection is that there was some practical obstacles that Anthropic has raised and so the proposal did not continue.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Next, they're asking Ilia if he spoke to the reporter Kee Hijy in connection with this article they're talking about. Ilia is saying he did not and he does not know who did. At the bottom of the page, they're reading from the page. are saying STSver had been waiting for a moment when board dynamics would allow for Alman to be replaced as the CEO. Ilia confirms that's true.

### 📝 セクション 52

And what were those dynamics? Ilia saying that the majority of the board is not obviously friendly with Sam. When did that happen? Well, there was a number of people that left the board for different reasons. The lawyer asks, "So, how long have you been planning to propose the removal of Sam?" IA saying, "Well, planning is not the right word.

### 💡 セクション 53

It didn't seem feasible that this would happen, but how long have you been considering at least a year?" Next, they're reading a passage probably from the same article. Sets was astounded. He had expected the employees of OpenAI to cheer saying, "Well, I didn't expect him to cheer, but I have not expected them to feel strongly either way." Next, they ask him why he left OpenAI. Ilia saying, "Ultimately, I had a big new vision and felt more suitable for a new company." The attorney once again wants to find out what the value of the equity that Ilia had in the company and open AI before he was leaving. Once again, Ilia's attorney prevents that from being answered.

### 🔧 セクション 54

There's some stuff that's been redacted, but Ilia does confirm that he still has a financial interest. Has that amount increased since he's left Open EI? Yes, it has increased. And just everything goes off the rails. There's stuff that's redacted.

### 🎯 セクション 55

They're just going back and forth going, "Would you allow the witness to speak?" I am. You're not. Be courteous and respectful. No, you be courteous and respectable. Then they're just like yelling at each other.

### 💭 セクション 56

Apparently, they have to take a five-minute break so that everybody can come down and continue in a professional manner. Attorney Agloni saying, "I'm tired of being told I'm talking too much." Attorney Molo, well, you are. Attorney Agloni, check yourself. This whole thing is very dramatic. Next, Ilas asked about his new company, Safe Super Intelligence.

### 📌 セクション 57

What was the purpose of that company? To do a new and different kind of research. What does that mean? Well, I have a new idea of how to do things, and I wanted to try them. Next day, he says that he hasn't spoken to Saman for a while, and he never talked about this lawsuit.

### ✅ セクション 58

He hasn't talked with Greg Brockman for a while, and he has not discussed this lawsuit with him. One really interesting thing here is that the lawyer did not want Ilia to answer who is paying for the legal representation. Who's covering Ilia's bills for the legal defense? Here's that question. Who is paying your legal fees?

### 📚 セクション 59

Ilia saying, "I'm not sure. I have a guess, but I'm not 100% sure." There's a lot of back and forth. Ilia's lawyer saying, "For this lawsuit, you can answer that question." So, seems like there's multiple lawsuits. So, here's where it gets interesting. Have you received any bills for legal fees?

### 🔖 セクション 60

IA says, "No." So, who is paying these bills? Is OpenAI paying your legal fees? Ilia is saying, "I think that's probably the case." Why do you think that's happening? Ilia is saying, "Because I don't know who else would be. Did somebody at OpenAI tell you to come and meet with these lawyers and hire them?" Ilia is saying no.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Have you discussed this law with anyone at OpenAI? Ilia is saying no. Did you discuss this at the position? No. So, this whole thing is still kind of murky.

### 🚀 セクション 62

We did get some details. I'm curious why OpenAI is paying Ilia's bills. I guess it makes sense from the standpoint that this all happened while Ilio's working for OpenAI. And since Elon Musk is initiating the lawsuit, OpenAI steps in just to make sure that Ilia isn't harmed by this. Recently, Elon Musk did once again accuse a moment of stealing a nonprofit.

### ⚡ セクション 63

So referring to the recapitalization of OpenAI. Interestingly, just recently within the last two hours, some response saying, "I helped turn the thing you left for dead into what should be the largest nonprofit ever. You know, as well as anyone a structure like what OpenAI has now is required to make that happen." He continues, "You also wanted Tesla to take OpenAI over, so not nonprofit at all. You said we had a 0% chance of success. Now you have a great AI company and so do we.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Can't we all just move on? So, let me know what your thoughts about this whole thing is. Are you a little bit more in favor of Sam or Elon or neither of them? Does your opinion of Ilia change at all after reading the deposition? I'm still not 100% sure as to what happened during that coup when Sam Alman was fired, but I guess we do have a few more interesting details.

### 🎬 セクション 65

If you made this far, thank you so much for watching. I'll see you in the next
