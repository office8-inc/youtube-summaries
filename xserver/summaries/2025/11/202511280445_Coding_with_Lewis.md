## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Every developer knows about them, but they never use them. Debuggers. When something isn't going right in our code, we resort to print statements, console logs, and more. To give us state, variable names, logs, you name it. And it's actually so common that LLMs are trained to do that by default.

### 📋 背景・概要

But there's actually a much easier way to debug though, and that's through a debugger in your code editor or IDE. Now, it's different for every code editor or language you use, but they follow a very similar principle. So first we set a breakpoint here. Then you run your code and when it gets there it pauses. And here you can look at all the state the variables performance without having to write it all ourselves.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Then we can step into the code to see how things change on the next line of code. And it just works great. There's no manual spa to it. You just click once. And even if you're like a terminal boy who pukes at the thought of gooies, you know, gross.

### 📝 詳細説明

There's usually one built into the language itself. And if not, it exists somewhere clearly. And once I found out about this, it literally changed everything. I stopped writing all that. Why did I write console log for so long or print statements?

### 💡 実例・デモ

It's actually kind of ridiculous. What do you think?
