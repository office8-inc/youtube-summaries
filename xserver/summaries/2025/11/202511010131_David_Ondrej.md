## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

The single most powerful node inside of NA10 is the code node. Yet, most people know nothing about it. The code node makes your workflows faster. It can greatly simplify your automations. It lets you build more powerful agents, and it unlocks all the options that custom code brings.

### 📋 背景・概要

But 99% of people will never use the code node because they're scared of it. However, you don't have to be a professional developer to use it. In this video, I'll show you exactly how to use the NA10 code note, even if you are a complete beginner. Real quick, I'm hiring a second video editor. So, if you know someone or if you are editor yourself, make sure to apply.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

The link will be below the video. Okay, so what even is the NA10 code note? Well, it is a specific note inside of NA10 that you can insert into any workflow that you have. Let me show you. So, when you go to top right and click on plus to add a new node, just type in code and there it is.

### 📝 詳細説明

This is what the code node looks like. Now there's two types of the code node JavaScript and Python which as you've guessed let you run different programming language. So let's say we go with JavaScript. Now NA10 will automatically open the note as if you clicked on it. And it will also give you some pre-written code which I'm going to explain how it works in a bit.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Now you might be thinking okay David when do you use the code note right? Because NA10 already has a lot of logic and math and conditionals. Well sometimes you need to do something unique something very specific that maybe there isn't any pre-made note in NA10. That's exactly when you need the code node. The code node lets you write custom instructions using JavaScript or Python.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And don't worry, you really don't need to be programmer to use it. I'll show you how you can use AI to write all of the code for us. And I'm not just saying that. I'm literally building a startup myself with the help of AI. I started Vectal when I wasn't a good developer at all, and I certainly didn't know anything about full stack web development.

### 🎯 応用例

The point is if AI can help me build an app used by over 60,000 people, it can help you build a simple agent in NA10. All right. So even though you don't have to understand JavaScript or Python, it is good to understand the input and output of the data how it is processed in the code node. So every single code node in N10 follows this basic pattern. And we can actually see this if we look at the predefined code that NAN gives us.

### 💭 考察

This part input all includes everything else that comes into this note. So obviously right now this is a standalone node. Nothing comes in or nothing goes out. But usually you have it inside of a larger workflow, right? So when you want to access the data that is coming inside of the code node, you would use dollar sign input.all.

### 📌 まとめ

And all we have to do is just save that into a variable such as named items or data or incoming data, whatever you want. Or if you want a single item and you don't want the whole array, you can access that with dollar sign input.json. If this is still confusing for you, let me break it down even more. In NA10, input item.json JSON gets the current items data. Input.all gets all the items from the previous node and then to send the data to the next node such as in this example we would send it here.

### ✅ 結論

We will use a simple return statement. So if you know something about programming, this is basically a function, right? It gets some data, it does something with the data and then it returns part of the data after it was fully processed to the next node so that your NA10 automation can continue working. And this is what the syntax for that looks like. return curly brackets JSON colon another curly bracket your and then the data as the variable.

### 📚 追加情報

Oh, and by the way, double slash these are just comments inside of JavaScript. In Python, that's hashtag and that's simple notes to make it easier for humans to read. So, if you are getting into programming or you're new to writing code, it is good practice to always add comments, especially to the most complicated parts of the code. But it gets better because the code note is a lot more powerful than you think. In fact, NA10 gives us a lot of predefined tools and functions and methods that can simplify working with the code node.

### 🔖 補足

So, let's look at the most useful of these. First one is this.helpers.http request. This allows you to make API calls to external services inside of the code node. And by the way, you can find all of these just by typing dollar sign. So, we go back into N10.

### 🎨 セクション 13

We open up the code note. Boom. Dollar sign. You can see these suggestions, right? So, any10 proactively shows you what are the pre-built methods or variables that you can use to do even more things even easier.

### 🚀 セクション 14

The second one is this helpers HTTP request with authentication. So, this makes an API call that utilizes the safe credentials you have in an A10. That could be like a Google Drive or, you know, Telegram, whatever you have, it can use those credentials to make an HTTP request. The third one and fourth one we already talked about, so we can skip past through them. But the fifth one is interesting because it lets you get all the data from a specific previous node.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So unlike number three input all this is from the incoming node, right? So the node that's right before the code node. Well, let's say there is like node all the way at the start of your automation that you want to access. Well, you would just do dollar sign name of that node that all and that's how you access the data from a node that's not the one before the code. Next, dollar sign JSON is another super useful thing to know.

### 🌟 セクション 16

This is a quick way to access the current items data. Dollar sign now gets the current date and time and you can use this in prompts as well. So for example when you have let's open up an AI agent in NA10. Boom. And you going to add a system prompt here.

### 🎬 セクション 17

If you switch to expression, you can say is and then double curly brackets and you can see that there's some suggested things and um you can do like if empty JSON but you can do now and the result would be the date time object being passed into the system prompt of the agent and it works the same inside of the code node. So you can do something like constant current date equals sign now. I don't know if it's best JavaScript practices personally I'm more of a Python developer myself. Next today, same thing but without the all the time, you know. Then do dollar sign workflow.

### 📋 セクション 18

This gets information about the current workflow, right? So such as this one is named the code note. So maybe that you could get the offer, the ID, whatever, a bunch of other stuff. Execution, that's info about the current execution. So if you want to have the code node work with that in real time, I mean, this is getting pretty pretty advanced, but Nathan has it if you need it.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And then dollar environment variables. So these are just some of the built-in helpers and methods that N10 gives us so that we can do even more with the code node. Now here's an example of a very simple code note that does multiple things and utilizes some of these helpers, right? So first we define a new variable named data and we put in the first current item. Next we define another variable and it's going to be array or a list of items and in there we're going to save all of the items from the incoming node.

### 📝 セクション 20

Then we define a third variable named previous data. And here we're going to use the syntax from number five, actually number six because we use that first method, but we get data from a specific node. This this time is named HTTP request. Could be any node that is before the code note in the workflow, right? So maybe you have like a bunch of other nodes here.

### 💡 セクション 21

You want to access a specific one. Just put in the name. That's it. Just the name and then that first and then.json. So we have three variables.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And then we're going to make a simple API call. So we await thishelpers.http the HTTP request with the get method. So these are the headers of the request and then the URL. So obviously this is an example URL and here's how you get the time. All right, so let's get practical.

### 🎯 セクション 23

What are some situations when it makes sense to use the code note? Well, let me give you four specific examples that you can start applying in your NAT automations today. Number one is grouping orders. So here's what that code might look like and feel free to take a screenshot, put it into chat GP and adopt it for your own automation. But basically, let's say you have a large amount of data, right?

### 💭 セクション 24

Such as 1,000 orders. Could be also a couple hundred lists or different strings, different names. Basically, a lot of data that is structured in a different way. That would be a nightmare to do with the standard set note or the standard filter nodes in any. So, what this code does, it groups the orders together by the customer, the customer's name, and then calculates the total spending for each person.

### 📌 セクション 25

So even though you might send 1,000 orders of unstructured data into this or it is structured but in a chaotic way, you know, not really human readable, even like 10 15 lines of code can return beautiful simple sentence such as John spent $45, Sarah spent $120. And this you can maybe insert into the system prompt of an AI agent. Now to kind of generalize this, the first situation where you would use the code node is when you want to process a large amount of data at once in your animated automations because the regular nodes can group or calculate, but they cannot do it both at once. And especially if you have a lot of data, it can be very chaotic adding a bunch of different nodes into your workflow where all that it takes is just adding a single code node that can do it all. So this is why when you see you know some of these content creators show you like these 50 nodes and like this ultimate AI agent blah blah blah a lot of the times they're just scared to write a single line of code and they don't know nothing about code nothing about computer science they are scared of the terminal and those 50 notes maybe could be seven notes but there would be one or two code notes in there but hey most people are not willing to learn and they're scared of code and by the way later I'll show you when not to use a code note because any has a lot of friendly and pre-built nodes that are beginner friendly and that simplify the whole process of designing systems.

### ✅ セクション 26

So even though ignoring the code note is very bad, using it everywhere where it doesn't need to be used is also as bad. So at the end of this video, I'll show you when not to use the code note. All right. Second practical actionable example when a code node is great is when there is an NAT node such as the WordPress node, right? It exists.

### 📚 セクション 27

It is pre-built inside of any but it cannot do some specific thing. So what this code does inside of this node is it uploads data to your WordPress website. So WordPress even though it's kind of a old technology it's still powering hundreds of millions probably billions of websites today. So this is one of the most commonly used nodes inside of N10. However, it doesn't support media upload.

### 🔖 セクション 28

It can only handle text content like posts and pages. But luckily since Nathan has the code note we can have these 12 lines of JavaScript which of course I got AI to write this to do that for us. So something that would have stopped the vast majority of people who built any workflows we can do because we are not scared of the code. Another practical example is utilizing the full advantage of an API when the NA10 version. So here we're using stripe has some limiting limited filtering which to be honest it almost always has limited filtering to make it simpler for people to build with it.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Luckily the code node doesn't have this limitation because in code you can build actually anything. So here we do an HTTP request with these headers. And for the off we want the username, boom, with the API key and the password. And then here we get the exact status. We get the plan.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And then we set a hard limit of 100. So what this code does is that it searches your Stripe for a specific subscriptions. So let's say you want to find people that are both active and on a premium plan, but only get 100 results. And maybe then you want to analyze their behaviors or, you know, average order value or the churn. There's a lot of situations in which you might need this data.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So why do we need a code node here? Well, the built-in stripe node can't search by custom fields, right? It's quite limited as you can see. And it cannot combine multiple filters such as both active or both premium. And again, this is not just the issue with the Stribe node.

### 🌟 セクション 32

A lot of different NAT nodes are simplified for non-developers which you know makes it easier to to work with them but it limits us if we want to build more powerful automations and AI agents but the code node lets you search with multiple specific conditions at once which the regular node doesn't support. Now there's one more useful situation in which you need to use the code node which is extracting and parsing nested JSON data from API responses. So the issue is that the built-in nodes such as the edit fields node, they cannot dig deep into nested data structures like JSON. But the code node lets you navigate multiple layers and search inside of complex arrays for the exact values and data that you're looking for. And here is a very simple example.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Again, nine lines of code. So there's a myth that your code nodes need to be hundreds of lines to be useful. That's not the case. Usually the code note is below 50 lines and it can still be very very useful. So again you don't need a PhD in computer science like all of this can be written by JBD.

### 📋 セクション 34

So let me show you how simple this is. Just open up JGBT and describe what you wanted to build. Browse the web to understand how the NA10 code note works. I'm going to do instant for this one. Boom.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And then I'm going to switch to thinking or the code because we want a more powerful model for code. And we're going to do Shopify orders, right? So the input data looks like this. And the scenario find orders where someone bought a large blue t-shirt. Pretty simple.

### 📝 セクション 36

And this is actually very applicable right now because there's going to be a lot of vibe coded apps. Loveable just released their Shopify integration. So if you learn a bit of NA10 and if you learn how to use the code node, you'll be able to benefit of this new surge of Shopify stores that have like completely viodated front end, completely vioded back end, lots of bugs, lots of technical debt if you can come in and if you know N10 well and if you know the code node well, you can fix a lot of that stuff and you can charge a lot of money fixing these wipe coded Shopify stores, right? So this is actually a very timely example and boom change default for 4 seconds and here is the NA10 node and you can see that this is like probably like what 40 lines bit more JavaScript. So first I told it to browse the web to research the structure of the nit node right to understand how it is how it works and the input data output data the stuff I already explained basically so again let me show you from scratch boom code node we'll use JavaScript because that's what JBD wrote but you can tell it to do Python 40 lines of code as I said usually it's below 50 you can you can do like basically anything below 100 lines and u I mean Kerpafi wrote like a whole GPT in less than 100 lines of code in Python.

### 💡 セクション 37

So yeah, if your code is 300 lines for some like data cleaning, you should probably delegate that to GHB is uh what I'm going to say. Anyways, you get the point, right? So we've gotten the mode is run once for all items or once run once for each item. You should probably tell this to the AI, right? So it knows which mode the code note will be in.

### 🔧 セクション 38

But as you can see, Chpt left out some comments for us so we know like, okay, this is a helper. Boom. quick existing product title if you want to constraint to t-shirt only. Then we inspect the properties of the input data. We check the variant title.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So there's the core math and then we return the output which is formatted here. So items filter and some JavaScript for how we do the matching and filtering. So as I said I don't even I cannot code in JavaScript myself without AI and u I've built anything automations that use code node no problem why because you can just ask JB or clot to do that for you it really is that simple and as I said you do not have to be a developer to use the code node in an A10. Now before I show you the situations in which you should not use the code node, let me tell you about how you can actually host your AI agents. Because no matter if we use a code node or not, if you build an anything automation, you want to make sure that it actually runs.

### 💭 セクション 40

And by far the easiest way to do this is with Hostinger. Hostinger gives you your own VPS. So you literally have your own virtual private server where you can host hundreds if not thousands of different NAN agents. And by the way, this is what I use for all of the agents that we use at our company. Every person on our team has access to a Hostinger server where we host our N8 agents.

### 📌 セクション 41

And not only is Hostinger super affordable, especially thanks to these Black Friday deals, but it's also very easy to set up. Let me show you. First off, to visit the Hostinger site, click the link below the video. Now, Hostinger offers many different VPS plans, but I think the KVN2 one is perfect for most of you, and it's also the one me and my team use internally. So, click on choose plan, and this will redirect you to the checkout.

### ✅ セクション 42

here. Select the period. I recommend going 24 months because when you build your agents, you want them to be running forever. Plus, you get a really, really solid deal when you go with the 24-month plan. You even get a free domain for a year as a bonus.

### 📚 セクション 43

And since Hostinger was kind enough to sponsor this video, if you click on have coupon code and type in David, you will get another 10% off of your plan. Next, we need to select the location of our server. So, just select whatever is the closest to you. And then, we need to select the operating system. Now, since we're building AI agents in NA10, obviously we're going to select NA10 right here.

### 🔖 セクション 44

And then what remains is finishing the checkout. So, click on continue. Next, we need to create an account. And this takes 20 seconds. Super simple.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Now, after you sign up, you get redirected to the billing page where you fill out your name and your billing details and complete the purchase of your VPS. And once you complete the purchase, you will find your VPS server right here in your hosting your panel. And you can see it's already running. So, click on manage. And here you can see all the details about your virtual private server, CPU usage, memory, outgoing traffic.

### 🚀 セクション 46

This is literally enough to run hundreds of AI agents. But what we need to do is we need to click on manage app. And this will bring you to your NA10 server when you can manage all of your AI agents. So if you're serious about building AI agents, make sure to check out Hostinger. Use the link below the video.

### ⚡ セクション 47

It really is the simplest way to host your AI agents. Okay, so now let me talk about when not to use a code note because as I said, never using the code note is obviously very bad, but trying to use it when there are better, simpler solutions is also bad. So let's go over these. Oh, and real quick, we're really trying to expand the YouTube team. So if you know somebody who's a great video editor or video producer, send them to veal.ai/job.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Or if you yourself are a video editor, go to vectal.ai/job and apply. It's a simple Google form. just fill it out and the best candidates will get an interview. It's as simple as that. So, please if you know great video editors, recommend them.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Send them this link. Tell them to fill it out. All right. So, NA10 has actually a lot of hidden gems. And NA10, what kind of NA10 is is simplifying programming, right?

### 📋 セクション 50

So, all of these workflows, they've been possible for many years, well over a decade, right? Like you could build like Stripe automation or Google calendar automations. All these things you could build them for many many years now. That's not what NA10 allowed. What NA10 did is just it made it a lot simpler.

### ⭐ セクション 51

It made it visual. It made it drag and drop. And that is mainly thanks to these pre-built nodes. So here are some examples when not to use the code note. Simple if else.

### 📝 セクション 52

Why? And it has an if else node. So you might use this when you need to split the workflow into two two paths. You know, true or false based on a certain condition. And you know some data comes in.

### 💡 セクション 53

Let's say if the data includes a positive integer, it's true. If data is false and you know the customer is broke and has negative bank balance, it is false. Right? For example, another example is the edit fields node. So this one can be used to rename fields, adding new fields or removing fields.

### 🔧 セクション 54

And you can think of fields as properties in the data like name, email, price or date. A good way to visualize this is the different column headers inside of a spreadsheet. Those are the fields and the edit fields node can simply edit them. Another situation where it doesn't make sense to use the code note is simple filtering. So thanks to the filter note, you can keep only items that meet certain criteria such as if the price is over 100 or if status is active or maybe you have a Google form for hiring like I do and you want to filter out people who you know are hardworking or something like that or maybe people who only have like above two years of experience, right?

### 🎯 セクション 55

You could do that with a filter note. Easy. Next up is the merge node. So this can combine data from different sources, right? Let's say you have two AI agents above each other that run in parallel and they output like a conclusion and you want to merge this into a single email report.

### 💭 セクション 56

That's where you would use the pre-built merge node. No need for a custom code note. Easily solvable. Next up, aggregate. So this is similar to the merge note, but a bit more versatile.

### 📌 セクション 57

The aggregate node in any can be used for calculating or grouping multiple items into a single item. So for example, you can group 100 sales recordings by region and calculate a total revenue per region to create a summary report. Next up is the sort node. So maybe you have a list of customers and you just want to make them from the youngest to oldest or alphabetical order, whatever. You just want to sort the list or the array in some way.

### ✅ セクション 58

Well, the nan sort node does just that. It puts the items in an order or it can also shuffle them randomly to make them unordered. Now split out is basically the opposite of aggregate. separates a single item that contains a list into multiple individual items for processing. Right?

### 📚 セクション 59

So could be a you know list of the orders from the last month and you just want to make sure that you prioritize the oldest ones or you group it into weeks whatever you want to do right there's infinite ways where you might use the split out node without using the code node. Now, the HTTP request is another super powerful node inside of NA10 that you absolutely should learn how to use and that unfortunately most people just skip because uh when they hear HTTP they're like WTF, you know, they're scared. Uh they it's like hearing terminal. But uh HTTP is like that's how the internet works. So learning how HTTP requests get made, how they how to send them, how to receive them, how to process them.

### 🔖 セクション 60

This really unlocks many different doors, especially if you're building an ATN agents. So this abstracts away the code. So you can make HTTP requests without writing any code, right? So you can make API calls to external services. You can do get, post, put, delete requests all with this one single node inside of any.

### 🎨 セクション 61

And you can even set the custom headers with this. Again, no need for a code note here. This HTTP request note is very powerful. It's one of the most powerful notes in NA10. To be honest, I might make a whole dedicated video on that.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Let me know if you'd like to see that. Anyways, moving on. Date and time. This is a very hidden note that a lot of people don't even know it exists in NA10. But anytime you're working with dates, formatting, adding, subtracting hours, calculating the time between two dates, you can use the date and time here.

### ⚡ セクション 63

I think it's built on top of the Python datetime module. Don't quote me on that. I haven't we can probably check that actually since NA10 is open source we can honestly just quickly check that daytime okay so here it is package nodes base notes daytime let's look at it okay so it's TypeScript so it's not Python okay I mean we can look at the division of languages right here oh yeah so anything is basically almost all Typescript all right well that's good to know anyways that's a little side quest another situation in which you should not use the code note is waiting you know when you need to add a simple timeout, simple delay, and it literally has a wait note. So again, you want to pause the workflow for a specific time interval or you want to wait until like a web hook returns some data, just use the weight node. Uh it's a lot simpler.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Now, perhaps the most common mistake is doing simple loops, right? Loop over items is a great node, great versatile node inside of any. And people think that you need to start doing code if you need to do for loops, while loops, stuff like that. Not true at all. Nathan has this great loop over items node that can go over a list, let's say, of 10 things and do specific actions for each thing.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So yeah, that's it. The code node, by far the most powerful node inside of any 10. A lot of people are scared of it for no reason. Just start using it. Use chat GPT to write the code for you.

### 📋 セクション 66

Tell it to add comments so that you understand what the code does. And just like that, you can build more powerful AI agents and automations than 99% of people using NA10.
