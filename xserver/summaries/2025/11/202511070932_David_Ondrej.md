## 💡 概要

この動画では、AIコーディングの正しい使い方と、「Vibe Coding」（計画なしにAIを盲目的に使う方法）との違いを解説しています。ソフトウェアエンジニアや起業家向けに、Cursor、Claude Code、Codexなどの最新AIツールを使った本格的なアプリ開発方法を3つのレベルに分けて紹介しています。AI市場が13兆ドルの労働市場に拡大する可能性を指摘し、AIコーディングを学ぶことが2026年に向けた最大のチャンスであると強調しています。実際に60,000人以上が利用し、月間$10,000以上の収益を上げたスタートアップの経験に基づいた実践的なアドバイスが特徴です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **Vibe Codingの危険性**: 計画なしにAIを使うと、技術的負債が蓄積し、保守不可能なコードになる。本番環境に到達するアプリは少なく、60日以内に放棄されることが多い
- **AI市場の巨大な可能性**: ソフトウェア市場は3000億ドルだが、AIエージェントの登場により13兆ドルの労働市場に拡大する可能性がある。これは史上最大の経済的チャンスとなる
- **3レベルのAIコーディングツール**: Level 1はCursor（オートコンプリート、Command K、エージェントモード）、Level 2はClaude CodeとCodex（より高い自律性と長時間作業可能）、Level 3は人間が学習しながらAIを使う段階
- **意思決定は人間が行う**: AIに技術スタックやアーキテクチャの決定を委ねると、平凡なアプリになり、技術的負債が増える。人間が選択肢を理解し決定することが重要
- **NvidiaやMetaの実践**: これらの企業では90-100%のエンジニアがAIを使用しているが、Vibe Coderとは異なり、計画的にツールとして活用している

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

AI coding is taking over the world. Here is everything you need to know. First, what is AI coding? It's the act of using an AI agent to write software. And the reason it's getting crazy popular is because it allows anyone to build anything.

### 📋 背景・概要

In this video, I'll teach you everything you need to know about AI coding to give you an unfair advantage in 2026. So, watch until the end. The first thing you have to understand is that we have entered the third era of software. Software 1.0 is writing computer code that's executed on a computer. This is how virtually all of software has been since the 1940s.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

However, in 2012 came the second paradigm of software which is where weights also known as parameters program the behavior of a neural net. But now we have entered into software 3.0 and this is where prompts aka plain English can program how an LLM a large language model behaves. And this only really became possible in 2019 with GPT2. By the way, shout out to Andre Kapathy for this graphic. Now, the reason I'm saying all of this is to make it clear that software is evolving.

### 📝 詳細説明

More and more people are building software with AI, and so we have to stay competitive. In the '90s, there were plenty of businesses who thought that they could ignore the internet. And today, there are plenty of people who are ignoring the AI coding revolution. So, my message is simple. Don't ignore this massive opportunity.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Instead, embrace it. Sit down, push through the friction, and learn how to code with AI. Now, I have to make something very clear. AI coding is very different from VIP coding and that's because VIP coding has many flaws. First off, let's define it.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

VIP coding is blindly using AI without any planning, no review, no process. This results in sloppy, insecure code with endless technical debt. And if you're trying to build software, technical debt is one of the worst things that can happen. It basically means you have no idea what the code is doing, what each file is for, and how the codebase is structured. This is why most vibecoded apps never make it to production and even the few that do make it to production often don't make it past their initial 60 days because they are not maintainable and they are definitely not scalable.

### 🎯 応用例

But AI coding is different. The goal of AI coding is to build serious scalable and production ready software aka apps that people actually use and that can be developed for months if not years. And by the way, everything I'm saying is from experience. Over the past year, I've used AI to build an entire startup. Since its creation, it was used by over 60,000 people and I've scaled it to over $10,000 MR.

### 💭 考察

So, trust me, I've made all of the mistakes that VIP coders make and some. I've used all the AI coding tools you can imagine. And in total, I've spent well over a,000 hours building software with AI. So, when I say that, there is a big difference between VIP coding and AI coding, just know that I'm speaking from experience. And by the way, this is how Nvidia, Meta, and Google do it with their own engineers and developers.

### 📌 まとめ

At those companies, nearly all programmers use AI, over 90%, I think at NVIDIA, it's 100%. However, they use AI very differently than VIP coders do. >> Every one of our engineers, 100%. Is now assisted by AI coders and our productivity has gone up incredibly. >> See, most people don't realize that the amount of software in the coming years is going to explode.

### ✅ 結論

I'm not talking about like double triple. I'm talking about 50x 100x the amount of code that exists today. There will literally be software everywhere. All of us will have personalized custom apps, scripts and programs, AI agents, automations constantly running in the background, saving us time and working on our behalf. If you think about it, this might be the greatest financial opportunity of all time.

### 📚 追加情報

Let me explain. This is the chart of the B2B SAS industry, which by the way B2B stands for businessto business and SAS stands for software as a service. In plain English, this is how much companies spend on software every year. It's about 230 billion. But if we look on the left, this is how much companies spend on knowledge workers, aka labor, every year.

### 🔖 補足

That's about 5.5 trillion. Now, you might be thinking, okay, David, but what does this mean? Why does this matter? Well, historically, software could only take up the software market, right? Code could only do what you tell it to do.

### 🎨 セクション 13

But with the era of AI agents, they can do entire tasks and series of tasks, which is a job, right? What is a job? If you hire somebody to do customer support, it is just a series of tasks for customer support, which means that the software market will be expanding to eat up portions of the labor market. Now, let me be clear. Software is already a big market, right?

### 🚀 セクション 14

300 billion global software revenue per year, a huge market. You can absolutely get very wealthy if you build a great software product. However, 300 billion per year pales in comparison to the 13 trillion per year that is the labor market. And this is in America alone. This is United States only.

### ⚡ セクション 15

13 trillion per year is the total addressable market of labor. And so what we're looking at is quite literally the biggest economic and financial opportunity of the history of the world. So now that you understand that AI coding is the future, let me show you how to actually do it. Now the first decision that you have to make is which AI coding tool will you actually use? And this is harder than it seems because every week there's a new AI coding tool being released.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And so I'm going to show you what I use every day when building my startup which actually works and which is I think one of the best setups that you can have. And I'm going to split into three levels. Level one, level two, and level three. Each level gets a bit more advanced than the previous one, but also more powerful. And so, let's start with level one, which is cursor.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And no, this is not a sponsored video. I wish it was. If someone from the cursor team is watching, let's figure something out. But anyways, cursor is perhaps the most famous AI coding tool, and there's a good reason for that. And that's because it can do all of the things you kind of need from an AI coding tool.

### 📋 セクション 18

So first off, if you don't have cursor installed, go to cursor.com and click on download. Double click on the installer and drag it to your applications folder. Then simply open up cursor. Boom. Just like that.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And the empty screen should look something like this. So then let me open an empty folder. Boom. New folder. Project.

### 📝 セクション 20

Create. Open. Now this is a dangerous step because most people get stuck downloading their first IDE, right? Even the concept of IDE might be overwhelming like what is an integrated development environment stuff like that. Calm down, take a deep breath.

### 💡 セクション 21

If you can install a video game, if you can install Zoom or Slack or Discord on your computer, you can install a cursor. Like it's literally the same, right? It's a application. It's nothing crazy and you can talk to it in plain English. So, while you might not be familiar with the user interface, just download the app, realize that most of the overwhelm and friction you're feeling is just perceived.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It's not real. Once you download it, you realize, okay, I can type in, hey, you know, I can interact with it. You know, on the right there is my files and folders and you will learn it quickly. Like literally, the first 30 minutes is the hardest. If you can push through that, you're already ahead of 95% of people who will quit before this point.

### 🎯 セクション 23

And yes, they do have a free plan. So, just click on the download button, go through the steps, set it up, and open an empty folder. Literally, that's all you have to do because I'm going to show you the rest of it. Now the reason why cursor is so popular and so powerful is because it can do everything you need from AI coding tool. Now I think it'll be easiest if I just show you right.

### 💭 セクション 24

So right now we have literally empty folder. So I'm going to create a new file. I'm going to name it readme.md. This is the markdown file. And then as soon as you start typing you will begin to feel the power of cursor.

### 📌 セクション 25

So say I do a build idea and then I want to build an encrypted real time messaging and then you can see that the gray text is cursor predicting what I want to say and all I have to do is press tab. Boom. And then another suggestion and I press tab again. This is called cursor tab or autocomplete. And this is the first of many ways that AI coding is more powerful than standard manual coding.

### ✅ セクション 26

You can literally type anything you want such as text tag and boom, React Native tap tap boom. It literally feels like it's reading your mind. It's insane. But if you think the autocomplete is impressive, you have no idea what's coming because this is just scratching the surface of what AI can do. Another powerful thing is what's called command K, right?

### 📚 セクション 27

So you highlight a block of text or code, you press command K and then you say make this a lot simpler and shorter. Hit enter and cursor will do exactly that. It will edit only the part that you selected, show you the div and then you have the option to undo or keep it. And if you click on keep, you'll see that it has made it a lot simpler and shorter. Now, if we were to stop here, we would already have a massive advantage, right?

### 🔖 セクション 28

Because cursor is literally predicting what we want to type. And you can edit blocks of code to fix bugs to make it, you know, better written, more secure, faster, lots of different opportunities. However, again, we're only getting started because inside of cursor, you can do command I, which opens the main sidebar. And this is the cursor chat, also known as the cursor agent, that you can talk to in plain English, and it can edit multiple files and design whole applications. Let me just show you.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, here we have literally nothing. So, I'm going to put my cursor right there. Boom. I'm going to switch to agent mode so it can do edits. And I'm going to say update the readme file so that it better describes the scope of our application.

### 🚀 セクション 30

It should be a web app. The text stack should be super simple. Let's make it Python only. And it should be a two column layout. User A and user B.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And it should be an encrypted messaging app. Keep the codebase structure simple. But do not code anything yet. Just update the readme file with this description of the build idea. Keep it concise.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Write it like a 10x engineer would. Boom. So I just use a tool called Super Whisper, which again not sponsored, but you know, there's like Whisper Flow. There's many other alternatives. My friend Jack Roberts and Yiannis, they're developing their own tool.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Lots of great tools from voice to text, right? Cursor even has their built-in button, but basically now I'm using the cursor agent to do what I want, right? So, I just speak it. Not even typing. Typing is slow.

### 📋 セクション 34

Even though I'm fast. I'm do like 120, which you know, it's fine. It's like top 1%, but there's people who type at 200 250 words per minute. Most of you probably type at like 40, maybe 60 words per minute, and speaking will be OP, right? You can speak at 200 words per minute like I just did.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I was speaking very fast, maybe even over 200 words per minute. So what I just did is just I just described my vision and now it executed it for me. So I'm going to keep it. But this is just a simple markdown file, right? So it didn't really create a code.

### 📝 セクション 36

So I'm just going to click on this voice input. I'm going to allow cursor to use my voice. Now get to work and actually implement this build idea like a senior developer would. The fewer lines of code, the better. Boom.

### 💡 セクション 37

And I'm just going to send that. So you can just use the built-in voice input from cursor. It's fine. And now you can see that the cursor agent begins reasoning. I'm using sonet 4.5 right now.

### 🔧 セクション 38

That's one of the best models for coding. You can also obviously cursor offers all of them, right? You can also use GBD5 codex which I think is the best model for coding right now or just the plain GBD5 or Hiku 4.5. It will be faster. Uh Google plans to release Gemini 3 soon hopefully.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Actually, even OpenAI is going to release GBD 5.1, I guess, in the coming week or two. So, lots of great models, but honestly, for most apps, it doesn't matter. Just use one of the top models. Okay, you can build most apps with most models nowadays. That's how good AI coding tools have become.

### 💭 セクション 40

So, you can see that uh we already have the app and just like that. It was like I was speaking for 40 seconds and the app is finished. It's super simple and all we have to do is install this. We're using Daffhane. I don't know what that is.

### 📌 セクション 41

So I'm going to ask what I'm actually going to switch shift tab to switch into ask mode. So in shift tab is one of the most useful keyboard shortcuts inside of cursor. You're going to switch between modes. What is tap? Boom.

### ✅ セクション 42

So you also want to be learning while you're you know using AI. That's the main differentiator between people who build something that lasts for months or years and between people who get stuck because they don't learn and they just blindly clicked accept all. Anyways uh let's review this file. Okay. Requirements txt.

### 📚 セクション 43

Let's keep that. Next file. This is a server. That's the main file. All right.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Keep next file. And this is the index html raw HTML. Okay. D is a SG server for Django. All right.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Well, I'm more familiar with fast API, but that's fine. So, one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do cond list env list to list all my environments. Again, if you don't have to worry about this if this is your main app, your first setup, just um install the global dependencies. But I have a lot of stuff u in the works. So I'm going to use a separate environment but that's beyond the scope of this video.

### 🚀 セクション 46

But if you want to learn about that you can literally just ask yourself what is gonda concept of Python and VM environments explain this like I'm five and obviously it will answer any questions and help you upskill yourself and teach yourself. Now as I said this is only level one of what is available today at the end of 2025 when it comes to the world of AI coding. And the biggest mistake that people make after reaching this level is that they do not stay in charge. Right? As you can see what I did, everything I did inside of cursor, I was the one leading the development.

### ⚡ セクション 47

I was the one telling the AI what we should do, the scope of the app that should be a web app. The UI it should be two column layout, the text tag that I want it to be Python only and that I want the codebase to be super simple. I was the one describing the vision, you know, I wasn't act asking the AI what feature should we add, you know, like what text tag should be used, h how the codebase should we create a new file. These things might be tempting if you're a beginner, but it is one of the worst mistakes you can make because when you delegate the decisions to AI, not only will you build a mediocre app because whatever the AI tells you is from the training data, right? And the training data is just the average of the internet, right?

### 🌟 セクション 48

So if you want to build the most mediocre average software ever, please go ahead. But the bigger issue is that you get lost. You exponentially increase the amount of technical debt because you have no idea what text stack you're using or why. You have no idea how the codebase is structured or why is it structured that way. These are the decisions that you have to make yourself.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And again, if you don't know how to make them, ask the AI for options. you know, tell me four possible text tags we could use for this build idea and explain the pros and cons of each. Very simple prompt. You don't have to be a genius to say that. Same with the codebase architecture, right?

### 📋 セクション 50

How should we architecture this? Should it be a monolith? Should this be broken into microservices? What would you recommend me to do and why? And even that, you know, even asking that one extra prompt is already a huge difference because you will learn the art of making choices.

### ⭐ セクション 51

In the realm of software architecture, nothing is free. Everything has trade-offs. If you just click accept all and if you delegate everything to AI, yes, you will move faster in the short term. But by short term, I mean in the hour, right? In the current hour, maybe in the next few hours, you will move faster if you delegate everything to AI.

### 📝 セクション 52

But comes the next day, comes the next week, and as I said, you run into the first difficult error that you cannot just solve with a single prompt, and it's game over. You have no idea what the app does. You have no idea which file does what. You have no idea where the functions are. You have no clue which text tag you're using or why you're using that text tag.

### 💡 セクション 53

You have no idea how to debug the app. You know nothing. If you behave like a VIP coder and if you delegate all of the decision-m to AI and that's why I call this the biggest mistake because it really is the biggest mistake. Now moving on to level two beyond cursor. This is the realm of coding agents, right?

### 🔧 セクション 54

Most notably claw code and codex. Now what coding agents offer is more autonomy. They can you know do more stuff on their own. You can run multiple agents in multiple different terminals if you're using the CLI or in the cloud as well with the codeex which again they can do more things right gives you more power more more options. It's always good to have options you know and then number three they can work for longer.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So while inside of cursor you know you ask and it responds right away usually after thinking for a couple of seconds with codex especially especially open codex it can run for hours I think uh the record is like seven or eight hours on a big task. So imagine that right imagine right here in Codex extension boom you you click on hi you describe you know you spend five or 10 minutes describing whatever you want to build let's say a new major feature or refactor to another language whatever and then you leave for 5 hours and you come back and it still does stuff it's like it can work on hundreds of files it can do a lot right so this is the power of coding agents they are a bit more complex but they are a lot more powerful so I guess there's three main paradigms you have the extensions so for example So this is the cloud code extension and this is the codex extension. Both of them you can download by going to extensions and typing in you know cloud code. Boom. Cloud code by enthropic.

### 💭 セクション 56

There it is. Looks like this or codeex which looks like this. So just click on that and then obviously install the extension. Very simple. If you get stuck at any point ask cursor ask sh GBT.

### 📌 セクション 57

It's not that deep guys. Use the AI to get you unstuck. Do not take any errors personally. Just take a screenshot of your screen. Say like boom there's a screenshot.

### ✅ セクション 58

Copy that. Paste it in. Okay. Actually, this is actually Codex. So, let's say we're here.

### 📚 セクション 59

New chat. Say, how do I install the Codex extension here? Help me, please. I am total beginner to this. Enter.

### 🔖 セクション 60

And if you say you're total beginner, it's going to give you clear step-by-step instructions how to do this. But anyways, the paradigm of extensions is one of the many paradigms, right? We have codex, we have cloud code, we have kilo, root code, client, many great extensions out there. Then there's the CLI which stands for command line interface. And this is uh if you prefer the terminal, right?

### 🎨 セクション 61

But if you're a beginner, the terminal might scare you, but you can just type in cloth, you know, once you have installed it and just like run cloth code in the terminal like this. And the power of this is that you can just uh launch multiple terminals, you know, and in one of them you can run codex, for example. Boom. Right? You can do a lot.

### 🚀 セクション 62

And let's say you want another one. You want another cloth code doing something else. Boom. You can say like explain to me uh restful APIs, right? Maybe this one is like coding, you know, this one is explaining, this one is doing debugging, whatever.

### ⚡ セクション 63

You get the point, right? So this is another way to interact with AI agents is through the terminal. And then the third paradigm is the cloud. This was pioneered by OpenAI with the release of CHBD codex where you can have it you know do many things. You can like launch 15 different tasks and you can say like you know update the UI of this component or add another unit test in this folder and you can just deploy these boom and it starts running in the cloud open cloud.

### 🌟 セクション 64

It's not running on your computer. This is a completely asynchronous and the beauty of this is that it can work on many different things at once. Right? So again I have plenty of videos just on that but that's another way to interact with these coding agents. Now, basically every tool that has the CLI can be turned into an automated agent that runs in your CI/CD.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Again, this is way past this tutorial, but you see like for example the cursor bug bot automatically finding bugs and reviewing reviewing pull requests and they actually built it in inside of um cursor. So, you can you know when you have a link GitHub repo, you'll see a button to check your code and find bugs. But the beauty of this is that you can run these AI agents inside of your CI/CD pipeline so that they find bugs before codes go into production. Right? Another thing that VIP coders never do, they they don't even have a CI/CD pipeline.

### 📋 セクション 66

Right? Which brings me to level three and that is human interloop. Level three is when you're actually using the AI to learn and upskill yourself. It is not just using cursor or just using cloex. Level three is when you are doing actual learning yourself, right?

### ⭐ セクション 67

When you're forcing yourself to learn and upskill yourself as you're using AI to write code. Now, this is obviously the hardest, but this is the most rewarding because the AI progress is already exponential, right? Now, imagine you add another exponential on top of that, which is your own progress. Now, don't try to do what the AI is great at, right? Like memorizing syntax and like doing pointless stuff.

### 📝 セクション 68

Instead, you should understand the fundamental concepts of software engineering. What is a database? What is a server? What is an API? Now, actually, there's a great video on this that goes over 30 concepts in software engineering or system design that kind of explain them very simple plain English and it will teach you what is a client, what is a load balancer, what is a database.

### 💡 セクション 69

And this is exactly what you should do, right? So, instead, you should learn the complimentary skills that the AI kind of sucks at. Obviously, if you ask it like what is a load balancer, it can answer it. But it's more about knowing these concepts intimately so that you can choose okay now we should use reddis cache to speed up the queries because there's a lot of data that's being read frequently and it doesn't really change so let's implement cache it's going to be much faster that is a decision you have to make as a human the AI it's not going to make that decision ever because contrary to popular belief contrary to what you know all the doomers think AI doesn't have any goals right this was coming from my head I gave it the idea to build this it didn't get that initiative to build It AI has no goals. It doesn't have any purpose.

### 🔧 セクション 70

It just does what it says. LLMs, large language models are next token predictors, right? So, what that means is like if you put tokens at the start, meaning if your instructions are terrible, the outcome will be terrible. And that's why most VIP coders get stuck. That's why they never build anything that other people use that makes it past the MVP fancy demo stage because they simply aren't willing to learn a few basic concepts, right?

### 🎯 セクション 71

Like this is the perfect example of how you should learn. You should try to get a broad understanding of all the different concepts of computer science. What you shouldn't do is memorize syntax, right? Like you can spend endless hours just reading the Python dogs, just browsing through this, memorizing syntax, stuff like that. And to to be completely clear, there is time and place where you should check the documentation, right?

### 💭 セクション 72

But what I'm trying to say is that the AI is good at something while us humans are good at something else. The AI is good at writing lots of code, you know, being very efficient, summarizing, solving problems that have already been solved many times on the internet, but the AI is terrible at creating unique ideas, at knowing how your app is going to be used, right? At having taste or judgment. It's absolutely terrible in those regards. So, that's where you should develop an understanding.

### 📌 セクション 73

You should go beyond just blindly trusting the AI and actually learn the fundamentals of computer science, learn software design, learn how to architecture codebase, learn system design and try to get this high level understanding of what is happening, what are all the options, what are the main programming languages, what are the main frameworks, what are the main database types so that when you use all of these AI tools and all these AI agents, you can move infinitely faster than a typical vibe coder that has zero knowledge of anything apart from like how to use Windows. Maybe apart from that Android and iOS are two different operating systems that has zero technical understanding of anything and it's just swimming and confusion and swimming in technical debt. And so here you have it. Here is everything you need to know to get started with AI coding in 2025. And obviously stuff is changing.

### ✅ セクション 74

So if you want me to make a video on this again because 2026 is right around corner, comment below AI coding and I will make more tutorials like this one. With that being said, thank you for watching and have a wonderful rest of the week.
