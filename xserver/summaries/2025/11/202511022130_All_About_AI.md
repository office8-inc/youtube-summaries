## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Last week, uh, I did a video on how I was planning to do like a trading AI agent that was using Claude code as the agent and just trying to come up with different trades we can do on like stocks with CFDs. So, uh, in this video, I just want to show you the results of my full week of uh, doing a few trades uh, using my AI agents. And I wouldn't say this strategy is nothing like genius or special or anything like that. It's just an experiment I wanted to do and I'm going to try over the next few weeks to iterate [music] and I kind of want to share my results. So if you're interested, uh this video is just going to be how we did the first week.

### 📋 背景・概要

Uh but there there's a lot of flaws here, some things I need to learn. But uh yeah, just wanted to share the results and maybe you can take something away from this. So now the video is just going to take off where the last one ended with my first trade and just go through the week. So yeah, enjoy. Okay, so after some back and forward, we kind of ended up on two trades.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh we are going to do or that I did. Uh we ended up with uh Beyond Meat and we're going to do a 5x leverage and on the Sophie uh we're going to do the 2.5 leverage. I'm going to screen record my phone. I'm going to show you the trades we have done so far. Okay.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, you can see this is the sofa trade we did. You can see we did a 29.98 opening price here. And if you look at the stop loss, we're going to do 27.5. And the takerit is just going to be as high as it gets, I guess. For the beyond meat, this is at 2 uh if you go to Beyond Meat, 2.08.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Now, we're going to do uh an entry price, I think, at 1.9. if we go down there. Uh so that is basically the strategy. Okay. So there's like 5 minutes now until the market open.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

We have our trades for today. Uh but first let's check out how we did yesterday. So uh I made a simple tracker here so we can zoom in a bit. We made $2 on our trade. So we had like this so far long here.

### 🎯 応用例

Uh the entry was 29.98. We exited at 30.06. So, a very low volatility trade even though we have 2.5 leverage. Yeah, we made $2. Uh, to be honest, I forgot to close out the beyond me trade.

### 💭 考察

So, I'm going to do that now when the market opens and I'm going to add that into the day two overview. Uh, but so far I guess we are in profits. So, let's take a look at today uh the today's trades. So, uh, the first one is going to be to go long ups and I have, uh, done the trades. I'm going to pull up on the screen here afterwards, like a screenshot.

### 📌 まとめ

And you can see, uh, yeah, we're going to go in with 5S leverage. We're going to do $1,200 exposure. Uh, and again, it wants to short beyond the meat. So, I guess we're just going to try that again. Yesterday, we went long.

### ✅ 結論

We'll see soon. uh I guess next episode how that went. But uh this time we're going to try to go short. So yeah, I guess that's the update for day two. So I'm going to keep updating day three, four, and five, and then we're going to do like a final thing.

### 📚 追加情報

Okay, so uh yeah, we are on day three. So I was just looking at Nvidia here. This is uh looking very good pre-market. Uh but I want to take up one thing because um yeah, uh I made some changes. So today we're going to try to do a long short hedge pair workflow.

### 🔖 補足

So we're going to find one stock to go short and one to go long over the intraday. So we can do this kind of inside the same sector. Let's see. So I have started this workflow here now to look for uh pairs we can do a long short trade on. Uh but we have to look how it went yesterday and not good news because yeah we lost $45.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So that means uh our yeah overall now is at minus 43. [snorts] Uh one thing that happened is I was going to place the beyond meat trade but I don't know what happened. It wasn't registered. So we only up ended up with the USPS trade that lost us $45. This actually went to stop-loss.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So we kind of automatically was uh sold out of this trade. Uh but I had a quick look. If we had stayed in, we wouldn't have survived anyway. Uh, but now I'm going to I'm going to just let this run and we're going to find the pair we're going to hedge today and I'm going to place the bets. So, let's just wait and see what that's going to be.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Okay, so these are the trades we're going to do. We're going to do long SoFi and short PayPal. Uh, we have already entered. So, I'm going to bring that up on the screen here. You can see we started pretty good from the start here on PayPal and we're a bit down on SoFi, but uh doesn't really matter.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I'm going to let it run and have the stop losses target kind of where we if we uh strike out that's fine. It doesn't really matter too much. So that is going to be the trade. So yeah, I guess you will see how this went in just a second. I have to wait 8 hours.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Okay, so the market has closed and as you can see, I think we did pretty good here to be honest. Uh we ended up with uh we going so far long, right? We lost $15 on that trade, but since we have kind of did that hedged thing, uh we also had uh PayPal uh short. So what we ended up with with the PayPal short uh trade uh was $31 plus, right? So we ended up with like $15 in profit.

### 📋 セクション 18

And yeah, I think this shows that this strategy can work. And I think we got to continue with this the rest of the week. And if we move this over here to our yeah total now, you can see we are still in the red. And that was mostly because of the long UPS trade we did that went minus 45. Uh but we are up to two winning trades, two losing trades.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And we did uh reduce the loss a bit. And yeah, hopefully at the end of the week we can be in the green. So let's just wait and see. Uh but now I want to show you the trade we're going to do today. uh because I have calculated that and again it's going to be like a long short trade or like a short long trade.

### 📝 セクション 20

Uh we're going to do short CQQ. This is like the Chinese uh what do you call it like tech um yeah some kind of ETF and we're going to do long gold. Right. So, I'm just going to bring up the uh the trades here on the screen. And as you can see, uh this is what I'm going to place.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, hopefully this uh is going to be good. And let's just let this run for a while. Let's see how it goes. And I'm going to take you back uh when this is completed. So, for you again, that's going to be a second.

### 🔧 セクション 22

For me, it's going to be some hours. So uh we are now on the last uh trading day. Uh so this is Friday 31st of October I guess. So yeah, as you can see on the screen, these are yesterday's trade. And yeah, we did pretty good.

### 🎯 セクション 23

You can't really see it here, but uh the gold long uh was pretty good. At least $12 up. And you can see the differences between the other two trades. Uh it was about $20. So yeah, that was a green and green trade.

### 💭 セクション 24

So, we went gold long and we shorted the tech Chinese ETF. So, if you go out to a tracker now, you can see if we add all this up, we are 676 yay dollars in profit for the week with four winning trades and two losing trades. So, yeah, we added those here. QCQ short and gold long. Perfect.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, that is pretty interesting. And today is the final day. If we can just keep in the green today, that means that we have a profitable week, uh, we're not going to we can't really quit our daytime job here and live off this. But, uh, it's pretty fun anyway. And I think I'm going to continue doing this because I had a lot of fun with it.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, let's bring up today's trades. Uh, I just had a look and we're going to do these trades today. So, we're going to continue with this kind of same sector hedge bet where we do a long short trade or a short long, call it what you want. So, today's selection was uh VDC and STX. I have learned something this week.

### 📚 セクション 27

I'm going to share that uh on tomorrow's breakdown, and I think I have a new strategy for next week that's going to maybe be a bit better. I'm at least eager to try it out. But now, uh for you, it's just going to be a few seconds. we can see how this trade went and we got to kind of conclude the first week. Uh it's been a real blast so far.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So I'm going to do a conclusion and see how we did and talk a bit about what's going to happen next. But yeah, see you in a sec. And that was the end of the week. So as you can see on the last day, we were pretty I'm just going to call it lucky because I don't really know what I'm doing here. But we did well.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Uh we ended up in uh what I would say is a nice profit here from this trade. So, uh, if you go check out the CFD trade tracker now, yeah, we are almost $47 up, right? Uh, there are some small decimal errors here like, but the main thing is we ended up with five winning trades and three losing trades. So, uh, and a few missed trades. I'm not so uh have so much experience on this platform, but it's getting better.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So I would say after this first week uh I really enjoy this. I had a lot of fun with it. Basically that was the point and I think there are ways to iterate. So I made some plans for next week. I'm going to try to iterate.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So let me just show you kind of my initial plan I want to try out. So this just comes from my first week of observations. And of course this has nothing to do with strategy, the way you should do things. This is just my experience. And that is kind of exactly what you see here.

### 🌟 セクション 32

We're just going to find us trading pair. We go short long. We're going to find the direction. If it's short, we're going to cut the long. If it's long, we're going to cut a short.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Just going to try it out. Just see how it goes for like five trading days. So, that is just going to be my strategy. Super simple, nothing fancy, and it's just going to be interesting to see where this goes. Uh I also have some small adjustments to the context.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, one thing I started with was uh let I can just close this. So one thing I start is I'll give give this right before we run the agent. I'm going to give it like a few front pages of like say CNBC. We can do Bloomberg I think Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg. So just on front pages with some futures and some headlines just before the market opens.

### ⭐ セクション 35

That is one other thing I added and that's pretty much it. Nothing fancy or anything like that. just some yeah experiments and I've been playing around with my custom instructions if you saw the previous video. So now now this is more of like a yeah we're going to do a trading pair on like a long short hedge strategy every week. So nothing about this is uh there's no beta, there's no alpha, there's no edge or there's nothing like this.

### 📝 セクション 36

It's just me having fun with using uh cloud code and agents to make trades with. There is no edge here. I think at least not yet. Can't see any edge, but I'm having fun with it. That is uh the most important part.

### 💡 セクション 37

And it's pretty low risk. I'm not risking like huge money. But if you want to follow along, check it out next week. I'm probably going to do a video from day one to five again. Uh I'm not going to do it in like two steps as I did now.

### 🔧 セクション 38

I'm just going to record every day and we're going to do the conclusion at the end of the week. That is my plan. So yeah, if you enjoyed this short uh experiment, give this video a like and yeah, hopefully I see you again next week where we can continue updating our trade tracker here. So yeah, enjoy your day and we speak
