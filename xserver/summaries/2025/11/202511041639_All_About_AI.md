## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Gaming memes go. Wait, this is Sora, too. Look, >> man. I'm not here to judge your whole life, but you died to the cannon minion eight times in one lane. At that point, it's disturbance.

### 📋 背景・概要

>> That's not a law. It's just a bad no wave, no vision, no flash. You autoed it once. It chunked you. >> So, over the few last months, I've been getting a lot of these comments.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

As you can see here, people asking if I can do like a step-by-step video workflow of how I at least generate AI videos. So, all my videos are like uh memes almost or like they're trying to be entertaining and make people laugh. I don't use AI videos for anything serious. I just don't find it interesting. So, every video I create, I'm trying to be funny or yeah, just make people laugh or do some weird stuff, I guess.

### 📝 詳細説明

Uh so, that is what we're going to do today. Uh so, it's going to be a bit of different. I'm just going to walk you through how I think about using all the AI tools we can do. So, 11 Labs, Nano, Banana, we're not going to use Sora, but we're going to use Cling, we're going to use Suno and put everything together from an existing clip. So, uh, as you can see on the screen here, this is just one of the results.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, this video on all platforms, you can see we got 3.2 million views on Tik Tok. We got like 5 million views on Instagram and I think over 10 million views total on all platforms this uh one minute AI video here. So uh and we also got a reaction as you saw in the beginning from uh a big Twitch streamer Asongold. He did a reaction on his stream and it just went super viral. So I'm going to leave the full reaction at the end of the video.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So but I just want to get started. I just want to show you how I actually go on to begin to create like a yeah what I call a viral video. Uh I'm not going to cover strategy in this video but I have a small section on it I'm going to explain soon. So it's just going to be the practical way how I do this. So let's just get started.

### 🎯 応用例

So uh if you go to Premiere Pro, you can see I have loaded up a clip here. So this is just uh it's just a clip from Pawn Stars. uh this uh pawn shop uh in LA. It was very popular a few I guess it's still maybe popular. I remember watching a lot of this.

### 💭 考察

So, we're going to try to turn this into like a funny clip. And I'm just going to walk you through how I think about doing this because I know we can do uh with AI tools and stuff. I kind of know everything we can do. So, the first thing I want to do here is just turn this into like a 916 because this is going to be from um for like uh yeah, this other platforms, not the YouTube uh long form. So, I'm just going to change to vertical, right?

### 📌 まとめ

So, we get it like this. Yeah, you can see this is fine. And let's say we wanted to do our first clip here. Yeah. So, what I think we want to do here is actually just uh the customer comes in, right?

### ✅ 結論

And we want to take their voices, turn them into, yeah, just is similarish voices and we want to represent something else here. Uh, not the the gun that he's selling. Let's try to sell something else. I have something in mind. So, the first thing I'm going to do then is uh we just need to grab the two different voices, right?

### 📚 追加情報

So, what I went ahead and did is I took some of the the main person voice. We can have a quick listen. So, this is Rick, the owner. Uh, Clark and Sherard. That is um it might be the rarest.

### 🔖 補足

>> Yeah, you get the point. And here's the customer. >> Been several of them. There's one sold for a big auction house. >> A very distinct voice.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, those are super easy to do on uh 11 Labs. So, I'm just going to head over there. And over on 11 Labs, we're just going to do create or clone a voice and just instant clone and just drop the MP3 file here. And then we kind of ended up with a voice that is called uh guy and Rick or Ricky. So these are the two voices we're going to use in our small clip here.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So let's just select the voice here. Guy one. And let's come up with the first line. We need something we want to sell here. So instead of the gun here, right?

### ⚡ セクション 15

Uh we want to sell something else. Let's uh do a screenshot of that. So I'm just going to screenshot this frame. Let's uh blow it up a bit first. So, let's just zoom in and adjust that so we get this in the center here.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I'm just going to do a screen grab of this. Okay. And then let's head over to Nano Banana. And then we can just do change the pistol to an old worn Halo edition Xbox controller. Remove the holster.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And let's just run this. But first, let's do PNG. And we want a 916. So, that is going to be our first clip here, right? And while we wait for that, uh, I want to change up the sound of the the customer.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, if you remember in the start of the clip here, uh, Rick says something like, >> "How are you, sir? I'm doing good. What we got here?" >> He says, "What do we got here?" And now I'm going to do this is an old Halo X Halo edition Xbox controller. I'm going to select my guy and let's just generate this and hear how it sounds. Okay, good.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So now that we have that, let's listen to it. So it's something like this. >> This is an old Halo edition Xbox controller. >> Okay, that's fine for this example, right? I maybe would have worked a bit more on it, but we have that now.

### 📝 セクション 20

So now let's check back on the image we wanted to generate. So we ended up with this. Uh yeah, I guess that's fine. So let me download this. Okay, download this.

### 💡 セクション 21

And let's head over to the video model. So, we uploaded the image, right? And then we can just do hands to the left, picking up an Xbox controller, moving it around. We can do uh I guess we can do 10 seconds for this. That's fine.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Maybe we can use some of it. So, let's do 10 seconds here on Cling 2.5 with this part. So, I'm just going to let this run. I'm going to take you back when we have this good. Now, we have this uh uh video clip here, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, you can see now uh this turned out pretty good. So, let's just play this with the audio from the customer. Now, >> this is an old Halo edition Xbox controller. >> Yeah, I think that works very good. So, what we need to do now is if we go back to our original clip, we just need to cut that out here.

### 💭 セクション 24

So, when it comes to Rick, let's hear what he says here. >> How are you, sir? >> I'm doing good. What we got here? >> This is a whole >> So, I think we're just going to start here and play it a bit.

### 📌 セクション 25

Uh but first let's make the zoom in here. So up until this frame uh I think we if we go back one frame you can see we are in this wide shot. So let's just uh cut here and then we can go back one frame and let's do the zoom in. That should be fine. So let's just zoom on him in on Rick here.

### ✅ セクション 26

And if you go one frame forward I guess we can see how long that lasts. And we can stop it right there. zoom in on him. So, let's do the zoom. Boom.

### 📚 セクション 27

And let's do that. Not that this. Uh, that should be pretty good. And this is the part we need to replace now. Right.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, let's go grab our clip and our audio. Okay. So, here is our clip, right? So, now we got the zoom in, we got the zoom in, we got the clip. Perfect.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, now we need to align the audio here. So, let's listen to this what we have so far. I'm doing good. What we got here? >> This is an old Halo edition Xbox controller.

### 🚀 セクション 30

>> Okay, I think that's pretty good. I think that's what we wanted. So, you kind of get the point now. We >> We got the original intro. >> I'm doing good.

### ⚡ セクション 31

What we got here? >> This is an old Halo edition Xbox controller. >> So, we kind of had the original intro, but we kind of altered it here. Instead of the gun, we have the Xbox controller, right? And the customer is going to comment on this item.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Uh I think we need some more music to make this work a bit better. So for that I like to use suno. So I did a prompt here I can show you. So the prompt was basically I'm going to show you. So I tried to do like this pawn stars porn shop intro music.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So it's like let me zoom in a bit. Lively acoustic guitar strums western country upbeat bass driven. You can just copy this if you want to. So, uh, I'm going to download this. Uh, let's try to use that as our kind of background music that kind of fits the whole theme here.

### 📋 セクション 34

Okay. So, I place the music on now. And I think that should be it. That should be kind of the way I work with this. Of course, I can't explain my ideas, but uh, this is basically all you need.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I think I'm going to show you the full project afterwards, but let's listen to this 5second intro now and kind of how this works. If we Yeah. do it this way. >> I'm doing good. What we got here?

### 📝 セクション 36

This is an old Halo edition Xbox controller. >> Yeah, I think that's good. Right. That is kind of exactly what I was looking for. And that is basically my workflow.

### 💡 セクション 37

Of course, I can't really uh tell what uh clips you want to do, but basically all what I did here now is uh things you can do. These are basically all the tools I use. I use screenshots nano banana to make the images I want. I use cling 2.5 to turn those clips those screenshots into video. I use text to speech to generate some extra audio if I have to.

### 🔧 セクション 38

We don't always have to do that as you will see in the full clip now. And I use to just do some yeah fitting background music. But before I show you kind of the full video, how it ended up, uh I want to talk a bit about my course platform because a lot of strategy goes into this. So I have my own AI video course. Uh it's been a while since I updated it, but I did that uh for a few days ago.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So with kind of if I go to my dashboard and if you sign up for the course, you will get access to the newest uh module. Of course, you get access to all the modules we have here on AI video, but the newest one is the viral AI video strategy where I kind of go into depth how I think about if you want to create a viral video. Uh I go into like a deep dive into this Tik Tok video here where we got uh yeah, I think over 10 million views. So, I think this is perfect if you you know how to do videos, but you're kind of a bit unsure what types of videos you need to make because there is some strategies that work very well behind getting millions of views. They're like length of videos, the strategy where you post, when you post, what kind of content and everything.

### 💭 セクション 40

So, I think I found a very good strategy for this that I share in this course if this is something you want to pursue, right? Uh so, go check it out. You can find the link in the description, the aivididecourse.com. And I'm going to keep updating when I find new stuff I want to share. So if you sign up once, this is for life.

### 📌 セクション 41

Uh you not there's no monthly subscription. It's just a onetime fee and you get all the new modules that come out. Uh but now let's go over and see my full project. Okay. So you can see now here is how it ended up.

### ✅ セクション 42

So this is the full project. What you think is funny is totally up to you. what you think is entertaining and I can't really learn that. Uh, I'm just going to go I like to throw in some funny clips here at sometimes. So, why don't we just watch the full thing and then I can do a few comments on basically how I did that.

### 📚 セクション 43

>> I'm doing good. What we got here? This is an old Halo edition Xbox controller. Wow, that is This might [music] be the most rare item I've seen ever. Where did you get a hold of this, man?

### 🔖 セクション 44

You know how rare these are? There's [music] like just a handful of these in the world. >> Absolutely. >> I'm like in awe of this thing right now, but they're so rare. I have my doubts.

### 🎨 セクション 45

You [music] understand why? It's just I basically just walked in here with the holy grail. >> So, how much you want for this thing? >> Been several of them. One sold for a big auction house.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Uh and it went for like 60 70,000 [music] something like that. I'll be happy with $900,000. So, u I'm going to go make a phone call. Get someone down here. >> These are so rare.

### ⚡ セクション 47

I saying it's like the Mona Lisa is not an understatement. I've never seen one outside a museum, so I've never actually touched one. Can I touch it? >> Absolutely. [sighs] >> Thank you very much, sir.

### 🌟 セクション 48

>> Thank you very much. >> Very knowledgeable. >> I love stuff like this. I love crazy weird [music] history. I'll tell you what, I have a rare copy of a game that that almost no one owns.

### 🎬 セクション 49

It's called Concord, and I am willing to make a trade for it. What do you say? >> Deal. I'll take it. It's [music] been a pleasure, man.

### 📋 セクション 50

Enjoy the game and good luck. >> Okay, so that was the clip, right? So, you can see uh in between there, you could see what kind of uh I tried to put in some different AI videos. So, basically, I didn't have like a great plan going into this. Uh I can mute some of the sections.

### ⭐ セクション 51

You can see here if we the timeline isn't too crazy. You can see here this part was a bit boring, right? This long part him talking. So, I put in like uh Rick here drinking a big pint in the middle of him talking. And here is just more images of the Xbox controller, right?

### 📝 セクション 52

And here I added since he I did his voice raising this to $900,000 as you can hear here, >> $900,000. >> And then I just took the second image and added like the price is now 900,000 like the bid that is typical from this pawn shop show. And from that I just used some old uh and here I just throw in like a random Rick shaving his head video. And instead of he says he asked can he can I touch it and I just thought it would be funny if he licked it. And I just took some random video here.

### 💡 セクション 53

And again Rick drinking. And this is an inside joke if you know anything about gaming. So, this is targeted at the gaming audience because Concord was like a game that sold almost no copies and was shut down right away. It's a rare game because no one bought it. So, that is kind of the inside joke.

### 🔧 セクション 54

He takes the bait straight away and they make a deal, right? So, it's basically everything is a joke, but the workflow is the same all through this clip. I just used voice nano banana cling and suno for the music. So everything else is just taste that you have to develop to your particular niche or what you want to create. Right?

### 🎯 セクション 55

So I don't think there's so much else to say here. Uh I kind of show you like a few techniques of how you can do this. But of course this is just a tip of the iceberg and the strategy is a big part of this. So, like I said, if you want to dive deeper into that, check out the course. Uh, but if people keep sending me comments like this, I will try to do a follow-up video on this, right?

### 💭 セクション 56

Uh, so yeah. Uh, as I said in the beginning, I said I was going to play like the full Asong Gold streamer reaction to my um 10 million plus viral video on Sorat 2. So, that's going to be for me. So, at the end here, you will now get a couple of minutes of Asmin Gold reacting to my viral AI video. So, enjoy that and hope this gave you some information and I'll see you again hopefully very soon.

### 📌 セクション 57

Gaming memes go. Wait, this is Sora, too. >> Look, man, I'm not here to judge your whole life, but you died to the cannon minion eight times in one lane. At that point, it's disturbance. >> That's not a law.

### ✅ セクション 58

It's just a no wave, no vision, no flash. You autoed it once, it chunked you. >> All right, man. You know why we're here. >> I didn't do anything.

### 📚 セクション 59

>> You did plenty. 53 real world days on that paladin. You're still an Ellen Forest. You haven't touched a dungeon. No professions past 30.

### 🔖 セクション 60

No mount training. >> You know what? Maybe I do agree with it. >> That's neglected progression. >> I just like the vibe.

### 🎨 セクション 61

>> There you go. Listen up, man. >> Are you serious? I didn't do anything. >> You did plenty.

### 🚀 セクション 62

0 and 11 on Yasuo with no wards bought. Refused to group and you stole blue from your jungle at level one. That's griefing. >> IT'S JUST A BAD GAME. [laughter] >> All right, man.

### ⚡ セクション 63

You're under arrest for willful gaming neglect. 3,000 deaths to the Tree Sentinel. Still level one. That's >> Yes. Bro, put them in jail.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Put them in jail for dying in a tree sentinel. This is See, finally we got some real This is some use of some [ __ ] police. >> Endangerment of your free time. >> Supposed to be hard. Kept charging straight in.

### 🎬 セクション 65

No shield, no summons, no stat investment. >> Dude, what is happening? >> There you go. Relax. >> For what?

### 📋 セクション 66

>> This is all AI detained for crimes against mid lane fundamentals. You died 10 times in 15 minutes, kept pushing without vision, and you blew flash for no reason. That's not illegal. >> It is. >> Partner, you're under arrest.

### ⭐ セクション 67

>> For what? I'm literally just playing WoW. >> Yeah. And you wiped that raid three times in a row. Pulled the bosses.

### 📝 セクション 68

>> Yes. God, Rob, I used to pray for times like this. Oh god, [sighs] bro. I used this is See, this we've been waiting on this one for a while. >> 70 when the healer wasn't topped, ignored the fire swirl mechanics, and then rolled neat on the mount.

### 💡 セクション 69

That's not >> Firelands. A list resort would be the only example of that making sense. And you know what? Back then, if I could have put the people in jail that would get hit by the fire tornadoes, I would do it. And you know what else?

### 🔧 セクション 70

It would be a one-man raid back then. Yeah. They arrested and released them after so it was only mistake on the police's end. Yes. Clearly.

### 🎯 セクション 71

When am I doing Sora? Should be soon, man. And it really should be. And uh yeah, tree sentinel I've watched. So I remember watching Kai die to tree sentinel a million times and then I remember watching Bonnie play Elden Ring for the first time.

### 💭 セクション 72

Man, I never really thought I mean I thought I mean it's a hard boss but like Jesus Christ like oh my god like it's not [laughter] that hard. Jesus.
