## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Google just released Gemini 3.0. It's a new AI model that's far better than Chad GBT. It can oneshot any website. It's number one on all the benchmarks. And what's crazy is that this is just one of many things Google released today.

### 📋 背景・概要

If you're not using Gemini 3, you're going to fall behind. In this video, I'll explain why this release changes everything. How Gemini 3 compares to Chad GPT and Claude, and how you can build anything with it. If you want to be on the cutting edge of AI, make sure to watch until the end. So, let me start by showing you its insane oneshot capabilities.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And what I mean by that is that it can complete basically any website you can imagine in a single prompt. So, here I told you to create a 3D Lego editor web app and to make it very visual and interactive. This even just a couple months ago would take many back and forths with an AI, lots of debugging, lot of describing what you want to build, but that's a thing of the past. Gemini 3 can easily one-shot on this. No issues.

### 📝 詳細説明

All right, so Gemini 3 has finished running. Took 44 seconds. I'm going to click preview. And here we have a 3D Lego builder. This is like a MVP of Blender and it was done in a single prompt.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Yeah, the future is here. Now, if you think this is impressive, just wait until you see what's coming because this AI model is insane. Another breakthrough was made on the ARC AGI 2 benchmark. This is a visual reasoning benchmark that tests problems that are not in the training data. And you can see that Gemini 3 is far above anything else.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I mean, it's not even close. And Gemini 3 deep thinking is even further ahead. But more on the deep think version later. See, with the release of Gemini 3, the AR race just got a whole lot more interesting. With benchmarks like this, it really feels that we are one step closer towards AGI.

### 🎯 応用例

Now, let's look at the model stats. First of all, it has 1 million context window, which is very nice, but the pricing is kind of in the middle, right? It's not a cheap model like some other Gemini models, but it's not an expensive model either, especially for the performance. Now, what's even more impressive is the speed. The tokens per second are very, very nice.

### 💭 考察

I mean, considering that this is a multi- trillion parameter model, 87 TPS, that's amazing. Now, what you're looking at here is a working 3D model of a nuclear reactor that was actually twoshorted from Gemini 3. When I say that you can build anything with AI, I really do mean that. Now, Gemini 3 is particularly good at front end, right? Now, why is that?

### 📌 まとめ

Well, Google has a gold mine of data, right? They have Google search with all the images. They have YouTube. They have Google Docs. They have arguably more data than any other company in the world, which allows them to make not only amazing AI models, but amazing multimodal AI models.

### ✅ 結論

And this Gemini free release is clear proof of that. And by the way, this is the perfect video to announce that I've partnered with Gemini to do an in-person hackathon in Warso, Poland. The hackathon will take place in January of 2026, and there's going to be limited slots. So, if you want to participate, make sure to follow me on Instagram and DM me the word hackathon. Oh, and by the way, Gemini 3 is now built in into Google.

### 📚 追加情報

So, anytime you ask something like this guy asked, "Help me understand DOS." And look what happened. Not only did Gemini 3 give an answer, it also created an animated interactive visualization of what a DOS attack looks like. This takes the learning to the next level. So, no matter if you're a visual learner or an audio learner or a video learner, doesn't matter. Gemini 3 is multimodal through and through and it's by far the best model at explaining and teaching concepts.

### 🔖 補足

Now, when I said that Gemini 3 was just one of many things that Google released today, I wasn't kidding because they also released anti-gravity. This is a full IDE. It's basically a cursor competitor powered by Gemini 3. Not only that, it has a built-in browser and a screen recording tool allowing Gemini 3 to see what it's building and to debug it in real time. Now, honestly, anti-gravity deserves a full video by itself.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, if you want me to make a dedicated video on Google anti-gravity, make sure to subscribe. Remember when I said earlier that Gemini 3 crushed every AI benchmark? Well, that wasn't an overexaggeration. Here is a tweet I posted earlier today of like 20 different benchmarks. And as you can see, Gemini 3 is number one on basically every single benchmark.

### 🚀 セクション 14

But yeah, whatever you want to do with AI, Gemini 3 Pro is basically the best model to do it. And a big reason for this is that Google has its own chip called the TPU. A TPU stands for tensor processing unit and it's an ASIC developed by Google specifically to accelerate machine learning and deep learning workloads. This not only allows Google to have super efficient inference, but it lets them serve their models like Gemini 3 much faster while also making the models cheaper at the same time. And most important of all, this allows Google to break free from the Nvidia monopoly where Nvidia is reaping 70% profit margins on every single GPU they sell.

### ⚡ セクション 15

But since Google has their own chip, the TPU, they're not as reliant on NVIDIA as OpenA or Enthropic are. Real quick, if you're serious about AI coding, then make sure to join the new society. Inside, you'll learn how to build your first AI agent, how to turn any idea into an AI startup, and how to master coding with AI. Look, you don't need to be a professional developer. You don't need any prior experience, and all you need is couple minutes per day.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And as you can see with Gemini 3, AI is advancing faster than ever. So, if you want to be on the cutting edge of AI, make sure to join today. It's going to be the first link below the video. Okay, so now let me show you how you can build anything with Gemini 3. And people have been building some crazy stuff.

### 🎬 セクション 17

For example, this guy built a clone of Cap Cut, which is an editing software in a single prompt. Sure, it took 230 seconds for Gemini 3 to run. But guys, this is an editing software and it was built with typing English into an AI model. Like, imagine telling this to somebody just two or three years ago. They would think you're crazy.

### 📋 セクション 18

they would think this is like 50 years away in the future, but no, it's possible today. So, let's see if I can build this. I'm going to try using Gemini 3 inside of Cursor to recreate a full editing software like Cap Cut. So, I'm just going to say make a Cap Cut clone web app that can actually edit video files with a proper timeline and everything. And since Gemini 3 is amazing at multimodal capabilities, I'm also going to attach an image of the UI so that it has something as a reference.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So boom, let me attach that. And I'm going to say keep working until the project is fully done. And agent mode, Gemini 3 selecting cursor. And let's launch it. And by the way, another way to use Gemini is through the Gemini CLI, which got updated to be powered by Gemini 3.

### 📝 セクション 20

Now, if you've never used Gemini CLI, just open up Gemini, the main web app, by typing it into Google and clicking on the first link, or just go to gemini.google.com/app. Let me check on our cursor agent to see what the progress is like. All right, so it created some folders. Boom. You can see that we have the entire project structure already and it's uh installing what xjs.

### 💡 セクション 21

All right, I'm just going to let it do whatever it's doing. In the meantime, let's ask Gemini, how can I install Gemini CLI with the latest version. This should also tell us how to update it, right? Because if you're like me, you already have it installed, but we need to make sure we have the latest update so that we can be using Gemini 3 in the CLI as well. Because right now, you can use it inside of Cursor.

### 🔧 セクション 22

You can also use it inside of Droid, which is like a cloud code competitor. It's actually pretty good. It has all kinds of different models. And Gemini 3 is in here as well. So this is the current way I'm using it.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Cursor Android, but Gemini CLI could also be a very viable way to use Gemini 3. All right, so let me see what the setup is. Okay, so first we need note. Okay, how do I update Gemini CLI? Should be like a single command.

### 💭 セクション 24

I think it's probably this. Anyways, let's see how cursor is doing. So the agent created a list of eight to-dos for itself and now it's going to do them one by one. And we can see that it has no problem running for m multiple minutes, right? Like in the past AI models would just give you a single response and they would need another human input.

### 📌 セクション 25

Then agents could do like multiple actions at once inside of cursor. This was really the breakthrough of the cursor agent. But now with Gemini 3, it can run for you know a long long time before it needs help from you the human. All right. So I'm going to run the npm command to update Gemini CLI to the latest version.

### ✅ セクション 26

Boom. npm install Google Gemini latest. Now, over the past few months, Gemini CLI was significantly behind cloud code or codex. However, now that might no longer be the case. Sure, the UI probably isn't as optimized, which is why I prefer using Droid over Gemini CLI because Droid is very smooth UI.

### 📚 セクション 27

It's probably even better than Cloud Code UI to be fair, but now Gemini CLI might be a very viable option of running the best model in the world. However, we're running into some issues. So, I'm going to use Gemini to debug this. I'm going to do logs. Boom.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Paste this in. Help me resolve this. What should I do next? Answer in short. And the reason I'm showing you, I could easily cut this out, right?

### 🎨 セクション 29

But I want to show you that you can fix any errors with AI. You can debug anything. Just give it enough context, describe how the error happened, and it will browse the web. It will think and will tell you what to do, right? It happens because your computer's rude like it owns some files in local MPN cache.

### 🚀 セクション 30

All right, so this is overthinking. Let's probably stick to using droid and cursor. Uh what's the progress here? So it's using vite. Okay, interesting.

### ⚡ セクション 31

It's still going. So it already created many many files and it's still running. Let me look at the thinking. All right, so it just was uh writing a large file. It seems stuck.

### 🌟 セクション 32

But yeah, Gemini generates tokens in a very different way. I think that's because it's running on the TPU and not the GPU. It's like in these chunks. It's not as smooth as, you know, enthropic models or OpenAI models where you can see the tokens streamed nicely. Gemini gives you like these, you know, paragraphs all at once, which doesn't look as nice, but hey, it works.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Now, while it's building our app, let me show you yet another benchmark where Gemini 3 is destroying everything else. And this one is named Design Arena. And as expected, Gemini 3 has taken the number one spot overall, as well as number one in four of the five code categories, website, gamedev, 3D design, and UI components. And you can see that on the overall ELO rating, it's far above everything else. And what's notable is that how close the other models are to each other, right?

### 📋 セクション 34

So like GPT 5.1 is only tiny bit better than close for Opus, but Gemini 3 Pro is far better. This is a huge step increase, guys. Nothing like this since GPT3.5, right? If you were in AI in the early 2023, you will remember how huge the GPT4 release was. This honestly feels that way.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And that's exactly how I put it on Twitter. Gemini 3 just feels like the biggest AI drop of the last two years. And from the testing I did, you know, using it inside of Cursor and inside of Droid, it just one-shotss everything. I mean, it never runs into bugs. It never has any troubles.

### 📝 セクション 36

When you want something change, you just describe it and it does it exactly. It's amazing at UI. It's amazing at front end. You can feel the raw intelligence, the raw coding power of the model. Like this feels like 10 to 15 IQ points ahead of everything else.

### 💡 セクション 37

All right, it seems like cursor has finished running. So here's the instructions of how to run it. The project is set up with white. We have the config. So we need to navigate into the directory.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Okay, so let me open a terminal and just follow the steps. Boom. npm install and then npm rundef. Let's see if it managed to oneshot a cap cut clone. Okay, so we have a error.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, it wasn't able to oneshot it. What a shame. So, I'm going to screenshot it. Let's see. Boom.

### 💭 セクション 40

We have an error. Honestly, there's like a 50% chance that it's my fault that I just didn't do one of the setup steps. But, let's see. This is a very ambitious project, right? Like a full editing software.

### 📌 セクション 41

Even 10 years ago, that would require a team of senior developers to build. Even the idea that you can do it as a non-technical person with an AI model, crazy. We we are living in the future and most people are just not paying any attention. But since you're watching this channel, you understand how big this moment is. And who knows, maybe two years from now, we will look at the release of Gemini 3 the same way we look at the release of JBT as kind of this pivotal moment in the history of AI.

### ✅ セクション 42

All right, so it seems to be fixed. Okay, so let's rerun this again. Boom. We still run into some error. I'm going to paste in.

### 📚 セクション 43

We still get some errors, fix them. We can also probably just uh launch a research, right? So, not only can you use just deep research with Gemini 3. By the way, the UI is not the best, right? So, to know if you have Gemini 3 inside of the web app of Gemini, you need to click on the right and click on thinking.

### 🔖 セクション 44

The thinking uses Gemini 3 Pro. The fast, I think it uses 2.5 flash. So do not use fast if you want access to Gemini free. But you can also select the tools and do a deep research standard. This runs for like 10 15 minutes.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It checks over 100 websites and gives you a super detailed answer. But then you can activate a deep think, right? And I think you need the Gemini Ultra which costs like $200 a month. And yeah, I know the AI subscriptions are getting crazy. You have like Gro Heavy cost $300 a month.

### 🚀 セクション 46

JBD Pro cost $200 a month. There's a $2,000 a month subscription for Droid. Could has a $200 a month subscription, but honestly, Google gives you the most for your buck. I mean, if we just look at Google AI Ultra and what it offers, you have highest limits in Gemini app where you can access Deep Think as well. 25,000 monthly AI credits, Flow, Whisk, Gemini Code Assist, and Gemini CLI, Notebook LM, Gemini in Gmail, Docs, Vids, and more.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Google Home Premium, YouTube Premium individual plan, 30 terabytes of storage. Yeah, I mean Google just gives you far more than OpenAI, Enthropic or Cursor can ever give you because Google has so many products, right? It's it has a full ecosystem of software that you can just throw into a single subscription. So yeah, Google AI ultra is a very powerful subscription and with the release of Gemini 3, I would strongly consider getting it if you have the means to do so, especially since you can access deep. All right, so cursor is requesting to delete a file.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Let's do that. It's running npm rundev. All right. So 5174. Let's go on this.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Okay. No error this time. I'm going to pop this out in the terminal. But we don't see anything. That's the issue.

### 📋 セクション 50

You know what? Let's let's kill this process and let's kill this process. We need to cd into capot clone. Okay. Tell me how to run the app now.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Need to do the same np run def. Boom. Yes. The issue. We have the white screen.

### 📝 セクション 52

I'm going to say when I launch the app, I just see a white screen. investigate this and implement a clean fix. So, we're not running into an error, which is progress. However, we're getting a weird uh wide screen, right? So, obviously, that's not intended.

### 💡 セクション 53

All right, we can see how the reasoning works. It read index html main.tsx app.tsx and it's making changes to these files. Now, it wants to run npm run build to see if we have any errors or not. That's interesting. I've tackled the type errors, which is a relief.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's weird how how it types like if it felt emotions. Definitely cannot feel a relief of fixing errors, but it seems like some of these were just like imported from incorrect libraries. Honestly, the proper way to do it would be just to launch a deep research so that it can read all of the latest documentation of this text tag instead of using, you know, outdated versions. Let's see what the training cutoff is. What is your training knowledge cutoff?

### 🎯 セクション 55

That would be interesting to know what Gemini free knowledge cut off is. Okay, so it's refusing to answer because it says it's powered by Google search, which is nice and all, but it definitely has a knowledge cut off. All right, so 11 files were edited. Let's see if this works. Okay, so we have the UI.

### 💭 セクション 56

This looks like an editing software. Let's import some media. All right, so the import seems to work. I'm going to import a file from this recording session. Actually, we have the media here.

### 📌 セクション 57

Let's drag it to the timeline. We have it on the timeline. This is insane, guys. This is running in the web browser, right? This is not a dedicated app.

### ✅ セクション 58

Okay, it seems to actually work. That is crazy. I mean, I don't know how much trimming we can do. We don't have many tools here. We have a timeline that we can manipulate and it runs the files.

### 📚 セクション 59

Even though the frames per second are a bit questionable, this is still again fully in the web browser, right? So, this is not running on my computer. This is running in the browser. And uh that's way more impressive because it works with multi- gigabyte files. So, while this clone of Cap Cut isn't as impressive as this guys, you know, who knows?

### 🔖 セクション 60

Maybe he worked with it for a while to polish the UI or maybe he provided a better prompt, more images. You know, my prompt was very short, so maybe that's my fault. But yeah, Gemini 3 is by far the best AI model, not not just coding, not only at design and essentially everything you needed to do. Another thing to consider is that over the past few days, virtually all types of assets were in the red. Whether it's stocks or crypto, everything was negative except for Google.

### 🎨 セクション 61

As you can see, even the other big tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon had massive drops in their market cap, but Google gained 3% yesterday. And let me remind you this is before Gemini 3 was released. You're going to realize that just two years ago Google was super behind on AI. I mean everyone thought that they completely lost the AI race. For instance, if you compared CH GBT to Bard, which was Google's AI product at the time, it wasn't even close.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Like Bart was probably two years behind CH GB. So to see Google from being very behind to having the best model in the world and not just by a little bit by a lot is honestly an insane comeback. I mean this is inspiring to say the least. And what people don't realize is that the future isn't guaranteed. Right now it seems that CIGBD is AI right to the average person if you say AI it's synonymous with CIGBD because OpenAI has such a massive distribution right they have so much momentum and it's kind of crazy to think that there will be something more popular than CIGBD but AI is a quickly evolving landscape two years from now Gemini might be the AI that's everyone using and honestly with each passing week that looks more and more likely and yeah I have to say first off hats off to team at Google this is insane the progress is incredible.

### ⚡ セクション 63

And also the other AI labs are in deep trouble, right? They have less data than Google. They have less money than Google. They have less engineers than Google. And they don't have their own processing units.

### 🌟 セクション 64

They don't have TPUs, right? So they don't have their own chip. It's looking like Google has not only made a comeback, they've also created a mode that gives them an insane advantage going forward. And it's very hard to see how anyone else can even catch up with them, let alone overtake them. So yeah, if there was one AI company that I would invest in, it would be Google.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Oh, and by the way, Notebook LM will now also be powered by Gemini 3. Notebook LM is by far the best way to learn anything with AI. And actually, I just made a video on it a few days ago. So click here and go wash it
