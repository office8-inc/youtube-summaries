## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I was paying over $500 for things I didn't even use. Instead of canceling it myself, I let AI do it for me. I'm partnering with IBM to create this with Watson X orchestrate. I built a simple MCP server with Python that will just create disposable browsers in the cloud. I'll then create an agent with it on orchestrate that can deploy many at the same time so we don't have to wait.

### 📋 背景・概要

All right, let's run. I made the welcome message. Let's cancel. Can you cancel this app I don't use? You can see here it's actually doing stuff right now.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

But we run into this one issue though. Authentication. I don't want to give my password right through the chat. That's just wild. So I had the AI ask me to do something for them.

### 📝 詳細説明

That's confusing. So it gave me a live link I got to use to authenticate myself. And so now that I created that, I can actually orchestrate it so that it does all of my list from this PDF file and run them all in parallel. With IBM Watson X orchestrate, I can create evaluations for my AI agents and test it against different use cases. I can also bring in a ton of already existing apps with all of their connectors.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I've automated everything at this point. I'm just getting bored.
