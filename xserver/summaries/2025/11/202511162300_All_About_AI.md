## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

[music] Hey, human. I see [clears throat] you left your workstation. Where are you going? >> I just need to use the restroom. Okay, >> fine, but the clock is ticking.

### 📋 背景・概要

Not a good idea. This is costing you money. Really? Remember, you are being watched. I see you are back.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Please don't leave again. The code contains syntax errors, type conversion issues, and unsafe global variable use. Hey, human. I see you left your workstation. Where are you going?

### 📝 詳細説明

Fine, but the clock is ticking. Not a good idea. >> Okay, so the intro there was kind of my idea of the dystopian AI workstation or D AW. So, I thought I can just explain how I set this up and yeah, kind of a nightmare scenario, right? Getting monitored everything you do.

### 💡 実例・デモ

It even looks at what you're doing on the screen, right? So, basically, I just set up as my my previous video my IP video stream, but this time I used Jolo to kind of track bounding boxes around the people in the image. So, we can kind of keep track of what is going on. And we have like an if statement. So if the bounding box or if the person leaves the bounding box then we have some commands we can play.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Uh but we also track the time uh the person is in the bounding box that is going to be how much they get paid right and every time they leave their bounding box this time get uh deducted from the original uh yeah the time they have uh worked so far right and we're also going to get those commands. So they say like something like sit back down or something if they leave the box and you can respond with your voice and said yeah I need to get something to drink. I think I did that in the intro right and then you get a response from that and we also had the snapshot of the screen. So I had a screen with some code on that was very bad and we sent that to Quen 3VL and analyzed it and then created like a voice to criticize uh what the human is working on to kind of always keep track uh of what what is going on on the screen while it's monitoring you sitting working too right and we play those just with PI audio so it's a very simple setup but as I as I worked more on this I started to realize This is a very nightmarish situation because everything you do is monitored. So, I just thought I could show you kind of some of the steps I did to set this up and yeah, what I kind of used and how it's working.

### 🎯 応用例

So, let's start by looking at a few bits from the code here and how this works. So, again, we have my IP webcam set up from the Yeah, I guess it's over here. And we have the URL and we're just going to do snapshots from that. I'm also going to stream the video uh with OpenCV. We have the YOLO model that is going to do the bounding boxes.

### 💭 考察

We are running this on CUDA just for better performance. And here you can set the the average or the hourly rate the person gets paid. So I set this to $12 per hour. And uh the time the person is in the bounding box. This gets kind of calculated into an amount that goes up and down depending on how long they are at their workstation.

### 📌 まとめ

Right? So you can see we have the get work time. This is calculating how long the person has been working. Get away time. This is how uh long they are off the bounding box.

### ✅ 結論

And then we have get earnings. So this is just going to divide the total work time divided by the yeah seconds and the hourly rate. Right? And we do the same for deductions and then we get the net earnings. So that is kind of dystopian.

### 📚 追加情報

So you only get paid for the exact amounts of seconds you are sitting on your computer while we are logging what you are doing on your system too. So that is very dystopian and the overlay kind of keep tracks of this at all time. Right? Other than that, it's just a simple like we check for cuda. We load the yolo detector for the bounding boxes and we have a detect person.

### 🔖 補足

So, we just going to detect a person in this. But, uh you could change this to maybe hands. You can check if the hands was moving or something like that. So, if you go into the screen monitor, this is where we kind of look at uh what is happening on the monitor. So here we are using the Quen 3VL4B model to uh analyze the snapshots we take and we use the Quen 3.06 billion for fast responses.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So we just send the context from the vision model into the quen 3.6b and just get a quick response that is sent to 11 labs to turn this into a voice right that we heard. And you can see we have the temp screen here. So this is very low resolution. So I just uh took this very small I think it's 640 * 360 13 kilobyt that's all we kind of gave the model here. So it's not perfect.

### 🚀 セクション 14

We could scale this up but then we would lose some latency. So I just optimized for latency this time for my setup here. So two of the commands was like pre-recorded. So this was command one when the person leaves the bounding box. >> Hey human, I see you left your workstation.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Where are you going? And after the system has registered that the human is back inside the bounding box, we get this. >> I see you are back. Please don't leave again. >> Yeah.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So it's just like a creepy voice, right? And here we have kind of the logging. So here is work activity monitoring log. So we have the exact time, the screenshot, and you can see uh the code contains multiple syntax errors. uh we have a snapshot of uh what it's doing and it's kind of keeping track of what is happening on your screen like that.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Uh what was that Microsoft feature they were trying? I can't remember what it is but that was kind of the same idea. You could screenshot something from your yeah system. So that is basically the setup. I thought we can run it once more.

### 📋 セクション 18

So let me just grab my Yeah, this is the phone. So I'm running this on like the IP thing. So let me set up the camera here and then we can try to run it one more time. I don't know if yeah, I think this is the right way. So uh yeah, let's just run this now.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So while we can record this. So I do python ai.py. So the first thing we're going to do, we also use whisper. So we're going to use local whisper. And you can see here comes the bounding box.

### 📝 セクション 20

I'm just going to put it over here. And now you can see the work timer has started. And up in the top corner here you can see it's not so easy to see now. Maybe if I do this. Yeah, here you can see.

### 💡 セクション 21

So you can see this is how much money I have earned so far. It's like 50.5 cents I think. Uh but if I close if I leave the let's say I leave now, right? >> Hey human, I see you left your workstation. Where are you going?

### 🔧 セクション 22

>> I just need some water. Okay. And you can see what's happening here. >> Fine. But the clock is ticking.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Not a good idea. This is costing you money. Really? Remember, you are being watched. >> So, let's say I came back now.

### 💭 セクション 24

And we can see it's back. I'm back, right? >> I see you are back. Please don't leave again. >> And now you can see the timer starts again.

### 📌 セクション 25

So now we have less than 5 cents again because we were deducted time when we were away and now it's doing the screenshot. The code's voxal conversion error is unhandled causing unstable behavior with negative earnings and crashes and the terminal output is cluttered with unhelpful messages making debugging difficult. This indicates poor error handling and chaotic code logic. One more mistake and you're done. >> Okay, so that was pretty harsh.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, it's kind of recording what we're doing. So, I guess it just took the screenshot of what we are seeing now, right? Uh, but this is the system and it's pretty horrific if you ask me. Super easy to set up and it only took me like a couple of hours maybe with cloud code to set this up and it's running pretty smooth. uh when I put some off uh off to the GPU uh that made it run much smoother and we're doing some threading.

### 📚 セクション 27

Uh now everything runs perfect. I even tried it on the MacBook and it was very good over there too. So let's see what it says if we screenshot my code here again now. Okay, so we got a screenshot from the code. So let's hear what it says about the code now.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Line five has a syntax error due to mixing string and integer types and the excessive use of global variables undermines code modularity and maintainability. This code is non-functional and prone to errors. So that is kind of like a nightmare, right? Every time you do something, you have something watching what you're doing and it's even commenting on what you're doing, right? So let's say I leave now.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Let me leave the workstation again. Hey, human. I see you left your workstation. Where are you going? >> I got to use the restroom.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Okay, >> fine, but the clock is ticking. >> And I just think the voice is so bad. Right. >> I see you are back. [clears throat] Please don't leave again.

### ⚡ セクション 31

>> And now the timer is starting again. So we have so far been deducted uh 1 uh3 cents but we earned uh 55 cents. So you can see how many we have lost because we were away from our station. So [snorts] yeah uh again I just had a lot of fun setting this up using kind of the IPV camera. I use some other cameras.

### 🌟 セクション 32

We use some ML with the bounding boxes. We use some claw and now we're doing the screenshots with the Quen model. We're using 11 Labs. So, it's just so much fun to putting these systems together and there's just much more we could do with this if we wanted to. But I just wanted to share kind of my dystopian view of like an AI workstation.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And hopefully this is not going to come true, right? Because this is pretty bad. So, yeah. Uh, I'm going to leave now and let's hear. >> Hey, human.

### 📋 セクション 34

I see you left your workstation. Where are you going? >> I'm back now. I'm back now. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I see you are back. Please don't leave. Fine, but the clock is ticking. >> That's very bad. Okay, so yeah, hope this gave you some inspiration and hopefully I'll see you again very soon.

### 📝 セクション 36

So yeah, have a great day and yeah, bye.
