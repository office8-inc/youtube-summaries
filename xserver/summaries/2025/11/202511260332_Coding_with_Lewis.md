## 💡 概要

今週発見した注目のオープンソースプロジェクト5つを紹介します。Rustで構築されたクロスプラットフォーム開発フレームワーク「Dioxus」、組み込みシステム向けの超軽量ブラウザエンジン「Servo」、プライバシー保護のためのDNSブロックリスト、1つのファイルで完結するリアルタイム認証データベース「Pocket Base」、そしてAIエージェントを使った自動世論分析プラットフォーム「Beta Fish」を取り上げます。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **Dioxus**: Rust言語でWeb、モバイル、デスクトップアプリケーションを構築できる革新的なフレームワーク。JSX風のRSX構文を採用し、サーバーレス機能も提供
- **Servo**: IoTデバイス向けの超軽量ブラウザエンジン。Chromeでは重すぎる組み込みシステムに最適
- **Pocket Base**: Go言語で書かれたオールインワンソリューション。リアルタイム認証、データベース、管理ダッシュボードが1つのファイルで実現
- **Beta Fish**: 30以上のソーシャルメディアを分析するAIエージェントプラットフォーム。新製品の世論を自動的に分析可能
- **プライバシー重視**: DNSブロックリストは、バランス型から完全ブロックまで複数のプライバシー保護レベルを選択可能

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Here are five open- source projects that I found really interesting this week. Dioxys lets you build applications for web, mobile, and desktop using a Rust codebase. You heard me right. It has this specific style called RSX, which looks a lot like JSX, you know, for the JavaScript devs out there. So, you're basically writing like an HTML looking syntax, but it's actually just Rust code.

### 📋 背景・概要

And it also looks like it's becoming like this full stack kind of architecture with serverless functions, sort of like like anjs of some sort. Servo is a browser engine with the funniest website. They literally just said, "Here's the Wikipedia article as an image." Okay, that's it. Servo is extremely lightweight and is designed for embedded systems. So, if you need like a browser engine for an IoT device, Chrome is going to slow that down.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Trust me. Honestly, a cool project. DNS block list is simply a list of DNS, IP addresses, domains, wild cards, and more to protect your privacy. And what I like about this the most is that it gives you different tiers of uh privacy that you want to choose. So you can have something like a more balanced or you could literally just block everything.

### 📝 詳細説明

It's honestly a great great feature. Pocket Base is a real time authentication database, admin dashboard and more all in one single file. It's written in Go and I've actually used this before, but I saw it on the GitHub trending, so I thought, hey, why not? Let's just try it again. It's honestly awesome.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And it says don't use until v1, but it's been like 3 years now. Okay. So, uh it worked for me, but I mean, do you trust me? Beta fish is a platform for automated public opinion uh analysis, which it uses the AI agents to analyze over 30 social medias, and let them talk to one another in order to get like a true final report to let you know how this is what everyone thinks about your new product. This is what everyone thinks about Coding with Lewis, etc.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Honestly, it's pretty cool, but somewhat dystopian, but it's open source, so can you really hate on it? What open source projects are you looking at this
