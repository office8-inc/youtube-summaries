## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Here are five open- source projects that I found really interesting this week. Dioxys lets you build applications for web, mobile, and desktop using a Rust codebase. You heard me right. It has this specific style called RSX, which looks a lot like JSX, you know, for the JavaScript devs out there. So, you're basically writing like an HTML looking syntax, but it's actually just Rust code.

### 📋 背景・概要

And it also looks like it's becoming like this full stack kind of architecture with serverless functions, sort of like like anjs of some sort. Servo is a browser engine with the funniest website. They literally just said, "Here's the Wikipedia article as an image." Okay, that's it. Servo is extremely lightweight and is designed for embedded systems. So, if you need like a browser engine for an IoT device, Chrome is going to slow that down.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Trust me. Honestly, a cool project. DNS block list is simply a list of DNS, IP addresses, domains, wild cards, and more to protect your privacy. And what I like about this the most is that it gives you different tiers of uh privacy that you want to choose. So you can have something like a more balanced or you could literally just block everything.

### 📝 詳細説明

It's honestly a great great feature. Pocket Base is a real time authentication database, admin dashboard and more all in one single file. It's written in Go and I've actually used this before, but I saw it on the GitHub trending, so I thought, hey, why not? Let's just try it again. It's honestly awesome.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And it says don't use until v1, but it's been like 3 years now. Okay. So, uh it worked for me, but I mean, do you trust me? Beta fish is a platform for automated public opinion uh analysis, which it uses the AI agents to analyze over 30 social medias, and let them talk to one another in order to get like a true final report to let you know how this is what everyone thinks about your new product. This is what everyone thinks about Coding with Lewis, etc.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Honestly, it's pretty cool, but somewhat dystopian, but it's open source, so can you really hate on it? What open source projects are you looking at this
