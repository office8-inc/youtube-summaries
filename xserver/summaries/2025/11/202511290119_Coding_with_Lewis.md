## 💡 概要

Shopifyのブラックフライデー・サイバーマンデーイベント向けに構築された、ブラウザ上で動作する完全な3Dピンボールゲームを紹介します。React Three FiberとThree.jsを使用して構築され、リアルタイムアナリティクスが統合されています。テクスチャベイキング技術により、事前計算された影と光をモバイルデバイスでも軽量に動作させることに成功。物理エンジンは3Dに見えますが、実際には2Dで動作し、パフォーマンスを最適化しています。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **3D技術スタック**: React Three Fiber、Three.js、WebGLを組み合わせて、ブラウザ上で完全な3Dピンボールゲームを実現
- **テクスチャベイキング**: 影と光を事前計算したフラットテクスチャを使用することで、モバイルでも軽量に動作
- **2D物理エンジン**: 見た目は3Dですが、物理演算は2Dで処理し、ボールを3D空間に描画することで高速化を実現
- **リクルーティングとマーケティング**: 技術的なショーケースがエンジニアの採用とブランドマーケティングの両方に貢献

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This is one of the craziest websites I've ever seen. A complete 3D pinball game with Shopify's real-time Black Friday analytics in your browser. How >> what is the tech stack behind this? >> React 3 fiber um at the highest level and then obviously underneath that is 3JS. Um I guess underneath that would be WebGL >> and the 3D looks super realistic.

### 📋 背景・概要

How did they do that though? Well, something called texture baking. >> They're just flat [music] textures, but they contain all of the shadows. that contain all the lights that are pre-calculated on a much beefier PC [music] and then they can run very lightweight on your mobile. >> In video games, you have to render reflections, shadows, [music] and more every single frame.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And that's expensive. But how hard was it to get the actual game running? >> This whole thing runs in 2D. It looks >> Wait, what? >> We had originally started with a 3D physics engine and we just couldn't get it to perform fast enough.

### 📝 詳細説明

And so we ended up doing this 2D version. And so this is what the pinball [music] board looks like to the physics engine. Uh, and everything else we do is drawing that 2D ball onto our 3D space. The ramps when it goes up and over, we actually switch what layer the ball is on. >> Brennan and the Shopify team clearly put a lot of time and [music] effort into this.

### 💡 実例・デモ

But why? >> You know, it kind of works out as recruiting. It works out as marketing. It it just a cool event to celebrate our merchants. I mean, BFM is such a big deal for for everyone.
