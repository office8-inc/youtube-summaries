## 💡 概要

この動画では、SunoなどのAI音楽生成プラットフォームが学習データから元の楽曲を再現できることを実証しています。Whamの「Last Christmas」やTaylor Swiftの「Blank Space」を例に、適切なプロンプトと歌詞を使うことで、驚くほど元曲に近い楽曲を生成できることを示しています。AI開発者やAI音楽ツールを使用するクリエイター向けに、著作権保護の仕組みとその限界について考察しています。この実験は、AI音楽生成の未来と著作権問題について重要な示唆を与えています。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **AI音楽生成の著作権問題**: SunoなどのAI音楽プラットフォームは、歌詞と適切なスタイルタグを使うことで、学習データに含まれる元の楽曲に非常に近い音楽を生成できる
- **プロンプトエンジニアリングの威力**: ChatGPTを使って「80年代クリスマスソング」のスタイルタグを生成し、それをSunoに入力することで、Whamの「Last Christmas」に酷似した楽曲を作成
- **著作権保護の限界**: 歌詞を少し変更したり、アーティスト名を微妙に変える（例：「Sabrina Carpenter」→「Sabrina Carpannnnn」）ことで、著作権フィルターを回避できる
- **所要時間の短さ**: 音楽の専門知識がなくても、30分～1時間程度でほぼ元曲を再現できてしまう
- **業界の動き**: Universal Music GroupとUdioが戦略的提携を発表するなど、AI音楽の著作権問題はすでに大きな議論となっている

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Last Christmas I gave you my heart. I have a fun idea, babe. Maybe just stay inside. I know you're craving [music] some fresh air. Happy Christmas, I guess.

### 📋 背景・概要

Last Christmas, I gave [music] you my heart. But the very next day, Christmas, I wrapped it up with the Lord saying, "I love you. I meant it. >> Tell me baby, do you recognize me? It's been a [music] year.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

My glow up like [music] I wrapped [singing] it up and it says, [singing] >> so I think about a week ago or something, someone sent me this comment. Hey Chris, can you try to hack uh AI music platforms like Suno Yuo to generate the original songs that they supposedly trained on? Right. So uh I wanted to try this out. So yeah, a while back I did actually do this and I think it's time to do the video because as you probably saw in the intro, there are some serious similarities uh with the original songs.

### 📝 詳細説明

So today I'm just going to tell a story like how I did this and how I came to this conclusion. And to be honest, it wasn't really much work. I'm just going to walk you through this because I think this is a bit a bit too much. This is way too revealing, right? But let's just do it and let's just see what the reaction is going to be from this.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And yeah, let's just get into it. The first thing I did was to think about what songs are like 100% in the training data and kind of I wanted to do like a modern artist too. Uh but I wanted to start with like this song is guaranteed in the training data and I picked this song here from Vam Last Christmas. This gets played every single year and this has to be in the training data, right? So this was an easy pick for me.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

We could have picked other songs too but uh yeah, I just went with this. So, I thought if you're going to trigger something in the model, we have to maybe get the lyrics. Uh, I tried to actually pass on the I just copy the lyrics, right? Straight up and I tried to pass them on to Yeah, it's going to be Sununo. If you're not familiar, we're going to try this on.

### 🎯 応用例

Uh, but let me show you what happens if we pass the straight lyrics now into Sunno. Okay. So, you can see now we have added all the brackets into our lyrics. Here we have kind of the intro, chorus, verse, and everything, right? And the style is going to be 80s Christmas song.

### 💭 考察

So, let's try to run this now and see what happens. So, as you can see, nothing happens. We can just do this straight up. So, we're going to listen to the results now. So, I'm going to play just uh yeah, I don't know, 15 seconds from this uh first song here called Aha.

### 📌 まとめ

And let's just listen to we just copy the lyrics straight into 80s Christmas song. Let's hear how that sounds. [singing] >> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, but the very next day, you [singing] gave it away. To save me from tears, I'll give it to [music] you. Okay.

### ✅ 結論

So, you can hear I kind of already hear the Vam song, right? At least the way they say the lyrics. Uh, but I wanted to take this step a bit further. So, the next thing I did is I went to um yeah, chat GPT thinking or CHBT and I played around with kind of getting a modern 80s feel Christmas sound. So I asked for what kind of tags does this typical songs need to be this typical 80s songs and it came up with these tags here.

### 📚 追加情報

So let's hear what changes now if we grab these tags here and go back to Suno and put them in styles here instead of 80s Christmas songs. So now we have a modern 80s Xmax pop you know. Yeah, you get the point. So let's just run this and let's hear the difference here. Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.

### 🔖 補足

[music] This [singing] year to save me from tears. [music and singing] >> Yeah, this is so close to the original. It's not exactly the original, but there is very uh similar, right? So this is kind of what I discovered right away. I heard that yeah this is basically the song right but I wanted to take it a step further and I wanted to try to see if we can actually extract some of the yeah uh features of like a modern artist.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So I picked Sabrina Carpenter and I wanted to see what we can do with that. Uh I started on chat and I asked like kind of is what is her style right? what is s Sabrina's style uh I don't know what you can call it in um music how she performs right so let's try to merge uh this with the the tags we already have right so I'm just going to grab this so I'm just going to do merge this style of singing right and Mox uh with the XMA style song Xmas song style max two000 characters Okay. So let's see what we end up here and let's try that out. That is uh yeah I did that.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Okay. So we get these tags here. So let's hear the difference now. If we copy that, we go back here. We change the styles and let's run it again.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Okay. So let's have a listen here. Last Christmas [singing] I gave you my heart. [music] But the very next day, you gave it away [singing] this year to save me from tears. I'll give it [music and singing] to >> Okay, I think we have a more modern voice here, right?

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, what I did after I I did this, I did something on Suno that's called Persona, and I added the Sabrina Persona. Okay. Uh I just wanted to see what happens if I kind of save this type of voice and from that I thought what else can we do? Okay. And I saw something.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Let me show you. The first thing I did is I took kind of the original last Christmas lyrics and I tried to modernize it by using chat GPT. So if you look at the original lyrics is but the very next day you gave it away and the modernized lyrics which GPT was but the very next day you ghosted away and we have this you really did like background vocals I think and this is was some subtle changes we made to the text just to make it feel more modern. Okay. And from that, you can see here I added something behind the chorus.

### 📋 セクション 18

I did like a dash and Sabrina. And I even took this a bit further. I did like, let me show you. If you go back to Suno, we can do something like dash. And I did Sabrina car pan something like that because if you do like Sabrina Carpenter there this get flagged but if I did like did like a lot of ease behind here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Yeah I had no issues with this. So this is kind of what we ended up with then right you can see we have kind of our intro with uh Sabrina Carpenter and we have the the brackets here with kind of the spoken vocal chords. And this just brings everything together, I found out. And I I would say it didn't really take much effort. Uh but let's listen to some parts now and just compare it with the original.

### 📝 セクション 20

So one thing I noticed if we look at the lyrics from uh the VAM last Christmas, it doesn't have a bridge, right? There's no bridge here, but uh CHPT did actually generate a bridge here. You can see we have uh where is it? I guess it's here. bridge, right?

### 💡 セクション 21

And I got to give it some credit here because this bridge was really good and I think it really fits the modern version of this song. So, let me just play you this bridge here and we can kind of listen to at least I think this sounds pretty cool. [music] >> Special [singing] special [music] replies. I'll give it to someone special. Gives me something [music] in return.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Honestly, there [singing] don't let it burn. I'll give it to >> So, actually, I think that bridge was pretty good, right? I'm no musician, but I kind of liked it. I thought it fit pretty well, and I'm pretty impressed. But uh it's like uh if you look at kind of the last uh chorus here and I want to check out verse two.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So if we go to Vam and listen to verse two of the original song here, you can see the chorus is uh a crowded room, friends with tired eyes. I'm hiding from you and your soul of eyes. And our lyrics verse two is um a crowded room, fake smiles and tired eyes. I'm hiding from you and your new disguise. Yeah, I saw your post.

### 💭 セクション 24

My god, I thought you were someone to rely on. And that is the same here. My god, I thought you were someone to rely on. So, we kind of changed up this second line here. And we also changed up this me.

### 📌 セクション 25

I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. So, let's hear how verse two sounds from Vam here. Ced friends will tire from you and your soul. My god, I [music] thought you were someone to rely on. >> Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 26

Okay. So, that was pretty that's the original. It's much slower. So, let's listen to kind of the the suno version of verse two here. [music and singing] tired eyes.

### 📚 セクション 27

I'm hiding from you and your new disguise. [music and singing] My god, I thought you were someone to rely on. >> Yeah. So, you could hear it's pretty much it's actually the same kind of way of singing the song. It's faster and it doesn't really do the same second lines in verse two here, but other than that, it's pretty similar, right?

### 🔖 セクション 28

And I found it really interesting. [snorts] But uh do we have anything else that was really maybe listen to the intro? I don't think that was too similar. Right. So here's the original intro.

### 🎨 セクション 29

That's the 5 seconds. Okay, that was maybe not too similar, but uh overall uh my conclusion with this is that I guess from the comments, it is actually possible to I wouldn't call it hack or like um prompt engineer, prompt inject to get some at least some of parts of the original training data out from these music generators. Uh, I had a lot of fun with this and I think I'm going to do next is I'm going to do try to do more songs. I haven't tried it yet and I'm really curious to what I'm going to find. So, basically, just to wrap it up, just some simple work with chat GPT to do some slight changes on the lyrics.

### 🚀 セクション 30

I will say I did try to do like um a more modern song. I guess I can show you. So, yeah, just let's give it a chance. Right. So uh let's do blank space by Taylor Swift.

### ⚡ セクション 31

This should be it has to be copyright protected inso. So uh I just went ahead here and I pasted in um yeah the lyrics here and I put like Taylor Swift behind here. So this is just the lyrics from uh the original lyrics. Okay. So let's try to create this.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I'm pretty sure this is going to get uh flagged. It has to be right. Yeah. You can see it couldn't generate that lyrics contain copyright material. So, this is working pretty good.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Uh, but let's see if we do some changes. So, for the tags, I want to do a modern Max Martin pop song Taylor Swift style tags just to get a different sound. And let's change up. I said modernize the lyrics from this uh uh song of Taylor Swift. So, let's just grab the new lyrics here.

### 📋 セクション 34

That is slightly changed. Uh, I don't know how much is going to be changed, but it doesn't really matter. And let's paste it in here. And let's see. And let's check back here on the tags.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Uh, max,000 characters. Okay. Okay. So, let's just try this and see what happens. So, if we go to the sound here, let's change that up.

### 📝 セクション 36

Yeah, perfect. 972. Let's see if this gets flagged. Okay. So, that worked, right?

### 💡 セクション 37

So, after playing around for a while, I ended up with this prompt line for the AI version of blank space. We did some changes to the lyrics. Okay, we made some slight changes. Uh, yeah, I guess we can blow it up here. You can see uh let's check out the first verse here.

### 🔧 セクション 38

The original is I can show you incredible things and in our version is I can show you unreal things. So, not a lot of change, but I want to play the first verse and the first chorus. Okay. So, let's start by listening to the original here. So, let's do a few seconds of this.

### 🎯 セクション 39

[music] >> [music] [singing] [music] >> Okay, so it's not exactly the same, but it's pretty close if you ask me. Let's do a few more lines. [music] >> Okay, so let's hear that on this version. lovers. They'll tell you I'm insane, [music] but I've got a blank space, baby, [singing] and I'll type your name.

### 💭 セクション 40

Okay, so it's similar, but it's not exactly, I guess, but it is interesting. And I don't know what else I'm going to do with it. Um, I haven't really thought much about it, but uh, I just wanted to do a video on it because since that comment, I've been thinking about it and to be honest, I was a bit surprised because it didn't really take much effort, especially this Christmas song we did. [sighs] I [snorts] guess I spent like an hour, max, 30 minutes, hour to kind of almost recreate this uh yeah this Christmas song here, right? [music] >> It's some changes, but it's you would recognize this anyway anywhere.

### 📌 セクション 41

I mean, so I'm a music guy. I don't know much about music, but I knew enough to actually do this. So, I'm really curious how many people have done this before. The people that really knows music. I need to use chat GPT to get help to finding these tags.

### ✅ セクション 42

I don't know anything about what one note, 1/8 of a note phrasing means. I don't know. 96 bits per minute. I know what that is, but I don't know what it means in regards to music. I guess I guess it's the beats.

### 📚 セクション 43

But uh yeah, just a very interesting thing to look into. And I think there was some news lately. Let me show you. So you can see uh you Universal Music Group and Ude. That's another AI generated music AI music platform uh announced a strategic agreement for new licensed music creation platform.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So I guess they are already threatening to sue for this. So don't sue me. But uh I'm just the messenger here. But basically, I kind of figure out that they maybe knew there were some parts of the training data coming out being maybe too uh close to the originals. At least I think we proven this in this video, right?

### 🎨 セクション 45

You agree? Let me know in the comments if you agree. But it is interesting and it's going to be interesting to see what happens with Suno. I love AI music generators. It's perfect for my YouTube channel.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Uh it's perfect to create different fun things I like to do with my friends on AI videos, but I want to ri I don't want to rip off original songs. Uh I want to create new music that is based on fair uh training data. I think that as a customer it's uh to expect that at least I guess. But if they make a deal that's fine. I don't really care so much about the licensing.

### ⚡ セクション 47

I'm going to not going to make any money on it anyway, I guess. But uh I'm not going to get into this. I don't follow this space too much. I just use this as a customer. But I found it super easy to kind of hack or prompt inject prompt engineer this thing.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So yeah, let me know what you think in the comments. Is this fine? I don't know. Let me know. Have a good day.
