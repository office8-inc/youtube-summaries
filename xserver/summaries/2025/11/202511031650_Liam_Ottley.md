## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Whether you like it or not, AI avatars are the future of content. And with 2026 [music] just around the corner, I thought it was a good moment to pause and take a look at what's the current state of the AI avatar industry. What are the core use cases being used? How are people making money with it? And who better to bring on to talk about this than my friend Hasha.

### 📋 背景・概要

He's made over $100,000 [music] selling AI avatar services to businesses. So, he's going to be breaking down everything that he's learned on his journey, including a deep dive on his favorite one, which he has built his entire agency around. So, if you're looking into 2026 and wanting to find some sort of offer or AI business that you can start, [music] AI Avatar is one of the best places you can be looking right now and this is going to be your masterass. So, enjoy. Hash, mate.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Thank you for coming on and I'm I'm really excited to to get into it. Yeah, Liam, I appreciate you having me on. I pretty much cooked up this entire board just to break down how to actually monetize with AI avatars. I want to just first break down what an AI avatar actually is. So just at the highest level, an AI avatar is essentially any AI powered digital version of a human, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

Could be real, fictional, you've probably interacted with them already online, and it can essentially act, speak, or interact on your behalf. And the easiest way to explain how an AI avatar works is you need an image, a video, and audio. You can use all three or just two of the three components, and then you can come up with this AI avatar. So you can see a couple examples here. For example, this is like an AI character avatar.

### 💡 実例・デモ

These are two of my own AI avatars. And then there's also professional avatars of existing professional act whoever which you could probably use as like stock avatar. Now, in terms of actually implementing it, there's a bunch of different use cases. And so I wanted to break down some of the most popular ones just to see, you know, what opportunities actually exist and how you can implement this. The first one would be faceless content.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I'm sure you've seen on YouTube especially or even on Instagram and Tik Tok people posting this faceless content of random avatars or characters uh just pretty much talking about whatever super cool interesting but you know from a monetization standpoint probably not the best opportunity. Another one is e-learning and training. This is more internal. So large businesses, they have massive HR and training portals. And so in order to create content for that, it takes a lot of money for studio setup, actors, and you know, setting everything up.

### 🎯 応用例

Whereas with an AI avatar, you can quickly deploy these e-learning and training guides. Another use case would be social media. So this is obviously me and my AI avatar. You can use AI avatars for social media content, right? For Instagram content in the short form side or even YouTube content on the long form side.

### 💭 考察

That way, if you're trying to create content but just don't have the time to record or don't have the right setup or even don't like being in front of camera all the time, you can essentially use an AI avatar to replace that process for you and then use the AI avatar to actually generate and create that content. Another one is interactive agents. This one I haven't seen too much of, but I know it's a growing industry. It's pretty much where you can have these interactive agents that your customers can talk to for customer service or for example in a let's say a course or a coaching program, you can have an interactive agent that interacts with the customers to answer questions or do whatever you need. So that's more of a dynamic AI avatar, but pretty cool use case as well.

### 📌 まとめ

Another one is product demos or outreach. Let's say you're a SAS company that's trying to send out hundreds of product demos, but want to customize the outreach to each of the leads that you're working with. You can use an AI avatar to customize the message and the demo so that you're able to send out messages and do marketing to large groups of people without having to be the bottleneck. The final one which I love and I've seen growing crazy on Tik Tok is virtual UGC influencers, right? So, especially in the world of e-commerce, uh UGC is everything.

### ✅ 結論

I mean, I'm part of an e-commerce brand as well. It's like a fashion brand um called the Urban Indian. We use UGC influencers all the time. And so being able to scale that using AI avatars is an incredibly powerful tool. >> Each of these is a massive massive [clears throat] use case or like almost like a whole industry in its own.

### 📚 追加情報

You know, like faces [clears throat] content like short form social media content. Um the e-learning and training one's massive. So that's what really excites me about avatars is just how many different ways it can be used. So I think if you guys are wanting to figure out any good business opportunities, then um this this definitely place that is uh is ripe for disruption. Well, like a lot of these existing use cases are right for disruption with this technology.

### 🔖 補足

So, let's get into the the rest of it. >> The way I see it, the opportunity is essentially leveraging this AI avatar system, right? Knowing how to use existing technology that allows you to create AI avatars, right? You don't need to reinvent the wheel. There's so many powerful, you know, tools out there that allow you to create AI avatars, whatever it may be, and build a service-based agency or an AI agency that allows you to deliver these systems to business owners.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And I think it's one of the most wildly profitable opportunities out there because video and media is becoming such a massive demand, right? Especially social media. And some of these opportunities I'll get into like AI avatars are the key to systemizing and scaling media. >> I think it's the classic case of this incredible thing now exists and businesses want it in some form. They just don't know how to get it and like the agency is the bridge as it's always been.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So you got to come in with the the knowhow and sort of the the strategy on how to implement the stuff but also the ability to execute on it and uh and roll it out for them in a system that actually and I mean more and more what what what I'm realizing with a lot of AI services it's like a third of it is the development and the setup and then there's like the majority of it is actually the the refinement and optimization in order to get the results. So say as we stuff we're going to go into in a second is like the iterative loops of like okay well that didn't work but that did let's let's like feed more of that back into it once you've got that dialed in um I think very few companies are willing to to grit their teeth to go through that pain. Um, so it be interested to see how you have dealt with that >> with any, you know, business opportunity. It's like you have a skill set that these business owners who have lots of money but not enough time want your skills for, right? So if you understand how to leverage technologies, build these AI avatars, and then offer that as a service to business owners, I mean, it's it's pretty untapped.

### ⚡ セクション 15

I think what could be important now is is really breaking down some of the top opportunities that I've seen work in the industry and in this world of AI avatars and the one that I think is really the golden egg, golden goose opportunity for anyone looking to get started. Okay guys, very quickly, if you're an aspiring entrepreneur and want to start your own AI business and you haven't already joined my free school community, it's down there in one of the links in the description below. has my full free course on how to start your own AI agency as a complete beginner. And you're surrounded by over a quarter million people who are also striving towards the same thing. There's no better place on the planet right now to be surrounded by like-minded people.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And you get free weekly Q&A with me where you can ask questions directly to me about how to start and scale your business. I'll see you in there. The first one that I've seen work really well is customized video outreach. So the way it works, super simple, right? You want to essentially create personalized videos for each prospect.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Use the prospect's names, company pain points, you know, information on their website to personalize these outbound pitches. You can scale it to hundreds of personalized videos daily and then integrate it with their existing CRM for automated follow-ups or messaging. The way that you can monetize this is usually with a setup fee, right? So, you're essentially building some sort of automation. You can templatize and then customize it for their use case and then you can charge per booked call.

### 📋 セクション 18

So every qualified call you get, you can charge, you know, $100. And then you can also have a monthly management around $250 or $500 a month to, you know, maybe adjust the copywriting or messaging or a new product came out and you want to adjust the, you know, automation. Super simple build. It's really just having this video API right on Hey Genen or Tavis. And so you can use these video APIs, connect it to an automation, for example, nadenmake.com to use these APIs, get the information of the prospect's name, company, whatever you're trying to personalize, send out the pitches, and then track it in the CRM, for example, go high level or whatever CRM, right?

### ⭐ セクション 19

HubSpot. The pros are that I would say it's probably the highest revenue potential per client, right? Because you're charging per lead. So, if you're getting good results for your clients, you will get paid well, right? And it's a very clear ROI to sell.

### 📝 セクション 20

I think one of the biggest things in the world of like AI and AI automation is that sometimes saving time is a hard ROI to sell unless they are a sophisticated business owner. But telling someone, hey, you pay me and I will make you more money and get you more qualified appointments, it's a very clear ROI, right? So, I think that's one of the biggest pros with this. Cons, I would say it's definitely saturated with SAS tools or SDRs that are already doing this, right? There's already tools that allow you to do this and they definitely work.

### 💡 セクション 21

They have their own benefits and, you know, withdrawals, but I'd say that's one of the cons in terms of like there's already cheaper solutions out there. It's harder to charge more for a customized solution. And I also think it requires a bit of deep sales knowledge to actually be credible to sell this. I think the interesting thing about this and probably all the other ones that you're you're going to mention the acquisition side is obviously like a lot more attractive a much clearer ROI for business. You get more meetings that's something that can very like this really understand like they see it on the calendar like it's either there or it's not rather than like time saving being a bit wishy-washy.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So I always see it as you can have these kind of like lead or like rockstar offers which are super attractive and you can lead with these and if you wanted to sort of upsell them on more generic automations afterwards then you can definitely do that. um if you want to increase sort of the the like lifetime value of that customer. It's also interesting that these acquisition systems are very good from a from a offer and operation standpoint because they are ex you can set them up external to the to the business or like minor integrations as as you you've done here. Um say with the content thing that's a whole engine you can set up and run all the posts. If you tried to productize or have a niched offer that was something much deeper into the business, there's too much so much more variance between even businesses in a given niche.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So these ones are quite nice. I think the lowest hanging fruit are these. I have this system that can largely sit kind of outside. I will like source the leads. I will enrich them myself.

### 💭 セクション 24

I will send out these with like uh with the with the automation platform and then anything that happens, I'll just update the CRM for you and that should be a pretty minimal integration. And so this goes for all niched offers. I think the people are looking at is can you find one? There's going to be more competition for it of course, but these things are relatively easier if you can keep them kind of separate and be say like a an acquisition system like this. >> I think you call like being a transformation partner, right, is one of the verbiages you've used.

### 📌 セクション 25

And I think some of these like AI avatar opportunities are really good entry points and then as you build trust, as you generate leads, you kind of do the back end. And I think that's something that I do with my agency as well is like my core offer is what I'm going to get into with the AI avatars. But then as we build trust with the client, we're like, "Hey, we see that you have this problem here. We could build something for you and kind of dive deeper into that back end once we built that initial trust." >> Yeah, I understand. >> So I think going to the second opportunity is very similar, right?

### ✅ セクション 26

You it would be UGC avatars for marketing campaigns. So you essentially create diverse avatar influencers. You can generate product reviews, testimonials, these UGC types of you know educational videos. You can rapidly AB test creatives and angles for this kind of UGC content and then maintain the brand consistency under you know having these product placements or whatever it may be. In terms of monetization, there's really two main options, right?

### 📚 セクション 27

It'd be a video package where you're like, "Hey, I'll give you 30 videos for $3,000 or a monthly retainer where you're kind of on for long term and you're like, "Hey, every month I'll give you 20 videos of UGC avatars creating content." I think the pros are that there's less competition because it's a newer concept. People don't really know about it or that it's a thing. And it's actually one of the easiest things to fulfill, right? These existing tools like synthetic UGC, even Sora, Arc ads, they are tools that all you do is put in a prompt, use their existing avatars and you can out content very very quickly, right? There's nothing advanced you need to do.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Then you can use something like notion or monday.com for content management to organize and create a better strategy. I think the cons is because it's a newer concept, it makes it a bit harder to sell to traditional businesses that may not be as understanding of this technology. And I would say the results are a little bit harder to measure than direct sales or, you know, booking sales calls or something like that. >> So, are you are you letting them know that it's AI or you saying I've got a bunch of models and uh we'll get you the the content or you saying, "Hey, look, we're going to undercut your competitors. you don't need to work with an agency or anything um like a talent agency.

### 🎨 セクション 29

We're just going to give you like a much cheaper access and faster access to these UGC models that you need. >> I think the way I approach it is like I let the client know what's going on and the client can choose to, you know, have that as a disclaimer or not. Something that actually like there's two companies or two SAS companies that or like series B series C companies that I've worked with on this similar thing. What we've done is essentially create a UGC avatar account that is external to the actual brand and so whatever the UGC avatars are saying is not directly related to or affiliated with the brand so they can be a little more open with their messaging so they can test more controversial controversial angles hooks and whatever it may be without liability on the company. So that's kind of a good it's it's a good win there as well.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Um and like these companies have reached out to me about it and so like it it's very clear indicator of like hey >> this is a this is something companies are looking for. >> Interesting. Okay. What's the table? >> And I think going to the next opportunity.

### ⚡ セクション 31

This one is is a great one. It definitely just takes a lot of effort. It's HR training videos and course material. So, how it works, you're essentially converting existing training manuals that may be old, outdated to more dynamic, engaging video, um, video manuals or training. It could even just be text documents that you're creating that don't exist yet for HR training, a new hire training, course materials for like a coaching program, whatever it may be.

### 🌟 セクション 32

You can create interactive scenarios. You can also do multi- language support for global teams. Let's say you have a video version of this training modules, you want to translate it to a different country, you can easily translate. And then you can also update content without having to go to the studio again, re-shoot, and do all of that logistical mess. This one, the monetization, like it's great.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Um, you can do course creation, so like 15,000 for 45 video course. This is something that I've specifically sold, but I probably won't again because it was such a nightmare. Uh, you have the patience for it. I mean, it's it's a nice bag. So, I definitely think it's good.

### 📋 セクション 34

>> Or you can do an annual contract where it's like you have an a you have like a training guide or, you know, new hire um training management that you want and just get them locked in a year contract where you'll dynamically update every time new, you know, information happens, whatever it may be. >> This is a great example of compared to the other ones where it's more directly facing like acquisition and helping them get more customers. This one's like, oh, it'll help your team be trained better. it and like we'll save you time on creating training materials and it just feels like a lot less tangible. Of course, it's it's very real time savings, but naturally it's a bit harder to uh show the value of especially when there's going to be so much involvement of them of like okay I need to train the avatar all of this stuff and like how much of an importance are companies on that on average putting on their team training.

### ⭐ セクション 35

It's like we've got the docs you know so is it worth is it worth 50k a year? There's got to be someone who's made a platform that's specifically for like creating courses with AI where you can add it's like it's taking the avatar stuff and building it not just into a centio platform um or a hen but where it's like AI course creation where you create your avatar put it in it can like help research the there's got to be that that out there somewhere by now right >> I would say Colossian's probably the closest thing to that which is why I included that there synthesia hey genen they're really good for like the video generation side but the editing part is kind of where you're going to need third party help. So, it's kind of like what you mentioned, right? >> It's the most stable and the outcomes are very clear of what you'll get, but it's like >> people don't want to justify paying for that because it's hard to see the direct return on investment. >> Also put in cons like it's just a boring niche.

### 📝 セクション 36

Like obviously boring businesses, you know, they make a lot of money, but >> it's just hard to create exciting content and just love what you do, which is like why else would you run a business, you know? You want to make a lot of money, >> take anything, right? Like Also, another con is like it's mainly for like corporate and enterprise. So, if you're a beginner that doesn't have the best connections like it might be difficult unless you have massive connections to like cue at massive enterprise companies, it's going to be hard to find and source leads for this sort of >> Yeah. Are we going to get to the point where someone could create a course fully and kind of people are okay buying it?

### 💡 セクション 37

like are the avatars going to be that good that you could buy someone's course and it's largely been like say you took a YouTube all of a YouTuber's videos you like to talk of the transcripts you sort of dug through them and and got some sort of a curriculum laid out then use AI to generate the avatars that could be an interesting service cuz that's like creating a whole new product for someone rather than like replacing training materials it's like I will create you like a an info product based off your uh your IP so I think that could be an interesting angle to take that. >> Yeah. No, I love that you said that because there's one client and one client only that we have done exactly that for. So, we essentially took he's a large creator, has like 200k YouTube, 200k or 300k across Instagram. Uh took all of his YouTube, took all of his podcast transcripts and videos and created like exactly this, right, a 45 video course and created a brand new info offer because he used to be doing one-on-one kind of he had a one-on-one offering.

### 🔧 セクション 38

we then switched to this group kind of course info program. So definitely a massive opportunity there, but it's just so tedious. Like making that the video course for him has been an absolute pain. >> And you kind of need like the the animations on top as well, right? I think those are kind of coming.

### 🎯 セクション 39

I saw Hen has had some of those like >> they can kind of start to animate like some video. If you give it a like some some content, it'll like animate it and like YouTube video style. >> Yeah. And it's it's paying a lot of money for editors to mask out the moments where the AI looks fake because it's a 15inute video, right? So, we want to keep it engaging.

### 💭 セクション 40

>> Yeah. >> And I think that's why it leads to opportunity four, which is the one that I've chosen and has been the most profitable for me, which is social media marketing content. [snorts] Right? The way it works is super simple. You want to clone a business owner or an influencer and make an AI avatar of them.

### 📌 セクション 41

You want to then create daily content or recurring content without requiring them to film. And you want to do this while maintaining their authentic voice personality. And the best thing that you can do with it is really scale it across multiple platforms and just have a content production capability for them at all times. You know, whether they're sick, they're busy, they're traveling, they have this avatar and they have this system in place to pump out content consistently. It's very unique in the monetization.

### ✅ セクション 42

You can have a setup fee, right, to actually set up the AI avatar, create it for them, do all of the strategy behind the actual marketing, and then have a monthly retainer to post content recurringly for them. So, this could be the $3,000 per month to $6,000 per month. Um, and then have video packages as well, right? For example, they want like 10 YouTube videos or they want 30 short form videos. You can do one-off packages that you just build and deliver to them at a time.

### 📚 セクション 43

So very unique monetization system. Pros, I'd say definitely high lifetime value with recurring revenue. Once you get someone stuck on the AI avatars, they are just so like they love it so much and they know that they don't have to sit in front of a camera that they just want to keep working with you. Especially if you know how to, you know, use the systems properly, right? And it's also easy to sell in my opinion.

### 🔖 セクション 44

It's there's a clear industry demand. Every single person is trying to build on social media. They know that having a personal brand is one of the most high leveraged things you can do and you can get a return on in investment. Another really fun part of this opportunity is that the system usually sells itself. So, if you're using social media marketing content for using an AI avatar for your own agency, >> yeah, >> that's usually going to attract leads for you anyway, who then see the system that you use to get them on the sales call and they're like, I just want whatever you you're using right now.

### 🎨 セクション 45

>> When you can line them up like that where your product is also how you market yourself, you get to work on the product >> as well as uh marketing yourself better. So, it's saves so much time without having to like work on them separately. They're like they're overlapping. >> I think cons, right? Obviously, I'm going to be biased because I love this opportunity, but I'm going to be objective with the cons as well.

### 🚀 セクション 46

It definitely requires a bit of marketing and copyrightiting skills. AI is absolutely incredible, but I don't think it's 100% there. So, just understanding a little bit about marketing, you don't need crazy experience, right? You just need to understand the basics of marketing. And I think being able to do this would be super easy.

### ⚡ セクション 47

The other cons is that clients expect ongoing content. So it's not really like a build and release and then have a management which you know other AI automation systems you know it's a lot of heavy upwork or upfront work and then it's management after whereas this it's more of a recurring cycle which obviously leads to recurring revenue. And I would say kind of execution-wise, you have the AI avatar generators. We use Hey Gen plus 11 Labs and then like lip-sync tools if we need uh use notion for content management and then distribute across social media. So breaking down exactly how I do this, right?

### 🌟 セクション 48

I would definitely say starting out just understand the offer, right? The problem statement and solution that I like to say is essentially business owners don't have time to record content consistently but require a personal brand or social media brand to build credibility and generate leads for their business. Right? That's really the biggest problem that we're trying to solve. And so the solution is going to be building this AI avatar and content system that allows them to post content consistently and grow their personal brand.

### 🎬 セクション 49

I use this system myself, right? So you can see a little bit of, you know, my brand and my page. I'm posting content like super viral content about like news like Apple stole $15 billion from Google, random things. And then also more educational content like how to scale your brand, right? How to create 30 videos in one day.

### 📋 セクション 50

So it's essentially just using this system to post content consistently every single day. And I've been able to grow my pages using this system along with posting my own videos as well. In terms of marketing, when you're first starting out with this offer, there's kind of three main ways or three main methods that you want to use for marketing, right? The first one is going to be the warm outbound. Literally just creating a list of all of your friends, family, co-workers, whoever it may be, making a massive list of them and messaging every single person.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Right? I know this is like Hermoszi preaches this on like how to get your first couple clients, and it's really like your first three clients are are in your network, right? So, I definitely say that is the first way to get it. I'd say the second way would be cold outbound. This is more of like a brute force method, right, to actually getting your first couple clients.

### 📝 セクション 52

Send personalized DMs. I would definitely say like Instagram and YouTube. The places where people are. Something I did to get some of my first like five or six clients with cold outbound was I would find people on Instagram that had like pretty solid personal brands, but they hadn't posted in like two or 3 weeks or even two or three months. And so I went to their page, I looked at the last time they posted and I was like sent them a personalized video on Instagram DMs and I was like, "Hey, I see that you have a solid personal brand, but you haven't posted in two months.

### 💡 セクション 53

Like like is it just because you're too busy or you don't have time to record content?" and then essentially just call them out respectfully and offer the solution. >> And so that was absolutely killer. I'd also use this kind of pattern interrupt and I'd be like, "Hey, I had a weird question. Can I clone you with AI and post content for you every single day so you don't have to worry about recording videos that like so many people DM' me and they're literally like that is one of the best like outbound hooks messages I've ever gotten." So definitely a good one. Don't be like everyone else.

### 🔧 セクション 54

If you can just personalize it, find something unique and have an extreme pattern interrupt that gets the prospect actually interested. I mean, you're going to do well. I' say warm outbound, have those convos, get those coffee chats. Cold outbound, send these messages on the same social platforms, especially to people that like aren't posting content consistently or have existing brands that haven't posted in a while. The third one would be organic content.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Obviously, if you're trying to sell the system, you should just use it for yourself, right? That way, you'll get better at actually delivering the system, understanding how to create the content, and just become a better marketer so you can deliver better to your clients. I mean, that's how I started. That's how I got some of my first clients as well on top of these warm outbounds and cold outbounds was just passively working on making the product and offer better by posting my own content. Now, once you kind of dial in on this, I mean volume, right?

### 💭 セクション 56

Just put in volume. Don't give up. As long as you are putting your message out there, you will get these clients. When I first started, right, and when anyone's first starting out trying to sell this, I definitely would recommend doing a two call close, right? Even though you're pretty much selling the same product, it's going to help build your sales skills by making the first call like a low pressure discovery, right?

### 📌 セクション 57

Understand like what is the current situation? What is the desired situation that you're trying to be in? What are the some of the biggest pain points that are stopping you from getting to your desired situation? And what are some ROI metrics? for example, like the amount of videos that you're posting or amount of leads that you're trying to generate that you can then use in the proposal.

### ✅ セクション 58

This is going to be super easy because all you're doing is having a conversation, right? You're not pitching them. The prospect is also dropping their resistance. They're going to be more open to sharing like their pain points, their desired outcomes. Do that discovery and then build a proposal for them.

### 📚 セクション 59

I definitely like doing the proposal on the second call and also closing on that second call. If you don't have the invoice, they didn't close, right? And so having that first call with the low pressure discovery, collecting as much ammo and information as possible to then build a really good proposal and have objection handling material on the second call is the best way to go about it as a beginner. So you can improve your sales skills without feeling pressured or feeling salesy to close them on one single sales call. >> Interesting.

### 🔖 セクション 60

And then how are you filling it? You got your >> Yeah. Fulfillment. I broke it down pretty simple. I mean there's a lot here, but AI can handle 90% of this.

### 🎨 セクション 61

>> I like to break down into like four kind of phases. The first phase would be the AI avatar, right? So hey Jen, use for the video avatar. You need two to five minutes of video footage and then from the client upload that to Hey GenE. Hop on like a consent uploading call where they essentially give consent to make sure you >> in in your contracts as well of like usage rights.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Hey, I'm only using this for business material. >> How how easy have you found for because I've made advances myself before and the amount of like retries and like I mean I'm a I'm a YouTuber. I'm like confident in front of a camera. I'm very familiar with cameras and lighting and all this stuff and it still took like many many many iterations until we got like one that I was really happy with. Um, so how have you found that going like a point of friction going to your clients and saying, "Hey, you need to have like good lighting.

### ⚡ セクション 63

You need to put the camera in this angle. You need to like you have to be very specific about how you speak and the hand hand movements." Like it's a very specific way of recording these. So, how do you how do you get over that? >> Yeah. I think the biggest things of when I was starting and trying to figure it out was like I said right using it for my own organic content.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So I just spent a lot of time figuring out I would say testing my own lighting, my own cameras, my own like hand movements, gestures, um different things to dial in on how I want to do it for clients. And then in terms of getting clients to do it correctly, I think it's just documentation, right? I had very clear communication and documentation on how to create the video avatar, right? So, I would say, "Hey, make sure you have these pieces of equipment." And then I'd have an equipment list on if you don't have these pieces of equipment, maybe you can buy this mic on Amazon. You can buy this box light.

### 🎬 セクション 65

It's super cheap. It's super, you know, affordable and it gets the job done. Have that list of information. Work with them on what they have and don't have. In terms of the actual recording, what I would do is I would block off on the calendar like a time for them to record, right?

### 📋 セクション 66

So that I can be on standby either on a Google Meet or just have my phone accessible so that when they're ready to record, I just hop on FaceTime, make sure the framing looks good, make sure the angles look good, and whatever that I need in terms of the avatar is actually up to par of the client. So we don't have to go back and iterate. >> You go through your content strategy after that. So that's obviously very personalized. And then the in terms of the scripting and stuff like this, are you putting their their YouTube videos into Poppy and getting it to extract ideas out for short form?

### ⭐ セクション 67

I want to do this of course. I follow the news cycle and make like AI short form videos of me explaining like the news and it's not really like a a core part of my my content strategy at the at this moment. But if I was to do it, my the main thing I'd be concerned about is how do you make sure it's irrelevant, it's new. Um, and if the person themselves is not involved in it, how do you like validate that those ideas are good? Um, so the ideation portion, how how you managing that >> once we get like the AI avatar and and everything sorted, which is honestly the easiest part.

### 📝 セクション 68

The scripting and and ideation is really where most of the revisions happen, right? So it's like each step of the way we have very clear like quality controlling, right? So it'll be like, hey, we have this is the strategy, right? I mean, the best way to create content is to find what's already worked for other people and already gone viral for them and recreate it with the specific angle of your client, right? So we essentially are like, hey, these are the angles.

### 💡 セクション 69

Um, we've already seen that they've proven to work. here's how we've rewritten them and scripted them to create it for you. In terms of something like the news where it's pretty new, we that's really just communication, right? Being like, "Hey, um, you know, Chad GBT or OpenAI just dropped this brand new tool. Um, do you like do you want to talk about it?" Get their approval, send the script, get a quick check mark.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Really just tagging them a lot in our client uh communication groups and being like, "Hey, we have a new script. Can you please approve it?" Yeah. >> Over time, as you get to know the client and as they get to trust you more, >> some of our longerterm clients that we've been working for over a year on content posting for them every day, they like don't even look at anything anymore. Yeah. We script it, we generate it, we edit, and we post.

### 🎯 セクション 71

And all they do is know that content is being posted here and there. They'll get some revisions. So, >> I would say that's probably the the biggest process that we do. And I mean, last thing, analytics, right? Look at the numbers, redesign the strategy.

### 💭 セクション 72

Content is an everchanging thing. So, as long as you know what you're doing and trying new things, you're in good hands. Once you figure out all of this, I would say that is really like what will take you to the first 25K. From 25K to 100K, it's what you alluded to earlier, right? Building that productized offer.

### 📌 セクション 73

It's essentially understanding, okay, this is the biggest things that my clients want. These are the biggest problems I've faced. for example, oh, people aren't creating the AI avatars um properly, right? I need to come up with some sort of customizable template or repeatable process for them, right? So, from 25K to 100K, it's really building this productized offer and templatized system that's it's a template that's customizable, right?

### ✅ セクション 74

I need this AI video footage, this audio footage. I need these pieces of information about your business so I can come up with a content strategy and then I have this script generate edit post cycle and you systemize these operations. Right? In terms of marketing, it's really taking that and at that point you should probably just focus on building case studies and doing good work for your clients so they refer you to people. >> Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 75

Usually it becomes once you hit around that 25K and I guess I'm speaking from experience, you get good enough at marketing and using the AI clone to where the system is genuinely selling itself and most of your leads will come from the same system that you are selling to other people. And so as you're h as you're building this recurring flywheel through content, you then want to eventually switch to that one call close, right? you know what you're selling because it is a single productized offer. You can now pitch it in a way that it's like you're doing a discovery, right? You're sharing your process, right?

### 🔖 セクション 76

This is a little bit of our deck. So, it's like, hey, this is the process for the client. This is what you can do. This is what we need from you, right? The required input.

### 🎨 セクション 77

And then I like to have this that's it, right? It's a very low friction process for you as the client to work with us. Then the second thing is case studies, right? I like to bombard them with case studies like to the point where they're like I'm tired, right? Literally talking about client results, client results, client results.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Have proof, right? Like have screenshots, have trackers, right? Show as much as possible of what you have done for these clients and make it very clear that they can achieve these results as well. Something I like to do is like with these case studies, I show all the case studies and before I go to like the pricing, I pretty much I I like to be like, I know I bombarded you with all these case studies. Out of everything you saw, which of these results align with you the most and what you're looking for?

### ⚡ セクション 79

And they're pretty much selling themselves, right? They're like, oh yeah, I really love that you generated 40 million impressions for this client. Oh, I love that you generated, you know, 50 leads in the first month for this client. >> Yeah. then they're just selling themselves.

### 🌟 セクション 80

And then I'm like, "Okay, well, I'm glad we can definitely do that for you. Do you mind if we talk about pricing and deliverables?" And then I talk about pricing. I guess super briefly, I'll go into kind of how we do pricing. There's two ways we do it, right? We do like the buildout if someone wants.

### 🎬 セクション 81

We literally just build the AI video audio clone, do the done for you strategy, set up like a funnel with ManyHat, and then have hands-on support where it's like, we built the clone and built the strategy for you, but we're not going to be posting the content every day or doing the rest of the hands-on work. This is more of a downell for anyone that like wants the system and our support, but you know, doesn't really want or cannot afford yet that monthly management. The done for you is essentially, hey, I'll wave out the entire setup fee if you commit with us for 3 months at 6K per month paying full or split and then we'll post content every single day for you and do the entire process. And so most people will be like, "Hey, I want to work with you for longer term and just do the done for you." But there's at least the downell for people that don't. Yeah, that's pretty much how we've been able to get these results.

### 📋 セクション 82

And I think fulfillment once you hit that 25K, it's like you should have enough experience working with clients to where like you have a clear client portal, right? A place where the client can see at every point in time what part of the process they're in. They have transparent tracking, right? They can see, okay, we're on the setting up the digle, which is what we call the AI clone or on the content strategy, whatever it may be. Internally, you want to have standard operating procedures, right?

### ⭐ セクション 83

That is how you will scale and not hate your life as the business owner is having clear standard operating procedures. And so you can see how thorough our standard operating procedures are like client information, right? Client WhatsApp setup. I literally have an SOP on what how to to name the WhatsApp group because I don't want anything to be out of order. >> Maybe I'm a control freak, but I just think it's given me so much.

### 📝 セクション 84

>> It's just it's just annoying, bro. It's like you go in there and it's like it's not satisfying. They don't all look this, you know? >> Totally agree. That's the small like how you do anything is how you do everything.

### 💡 セクション 85

>> And and so it's like be detailed, be specific. We have like Loom videos that I've created for each of these processes. And you can slowly use that to build a business operating system to organize your own business and how you're scaling. This is mine. It's definitely overcomplexified because I just like notion, but >> a good notion is really satisfying as well, you know.

### 🔧 セクション 86

It's like >> it is. It is part of it. Yeah. So >> yeah. So I think fulfillment really getting from 25K to 100K is like know what is happening over and over again.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Know the biggest mistakes and bottlenecks that are occurring from getting your clients results and systemize that and document that so that you can avoid those mistakes in the future. And I think in the ideal world as you grow you want to hire. Um this is like an example of what my business looks like right now. So me at the top to be genuinely honest I could disappear from the business for a week and the business would run and that is genuinely because of the org chart hiring the right team and giving them the right training and SOPs to where they can fulfill right you want to be respectful to them and give them the right instructions and so I would say for this sort of offer you want to have someone that focuses on like marketing strategy and then someone that focus on client success and operations. The marketing director can act as or manage a content strategist, a copywriter, and then an editor.

### 💭 セクション 88

The client success director or product manager, can also manage the editor, which is like a key part of this process. The generative creator, which is just our fun term for the person that uses Hey Gen. And then the social media manager, who actually like goes out, posts the content and the captions. And then the editing is going to be your biggest bottleneck. So you want to have more editors on tap for like freelance.

### 📌 セクション 89

So >> yeah, >> I mean generative creator is is kind of turning into its own thing as well. Like we we have like a lot of needs for AI generated like images or or or videos and the skill set to get the best out of them is is loc like I could probably get a freelance or like part-time um generative creator on my team as is. Um so it's interesting thing that people could slide into there. But um yeah, this is really helpful to to see how you've got it structured there. What's the also the incentive structure on there?

### ✅ セクション 90

How have you got that set up for I mean obviously if it's coming from the marketing director or the content strategist, whoever is doing that. Um they're obviously picking the shots, the copyriters like writing that and then the editors are kind sort of executing on that. So how have you got the like incentive structure for like high performing reels or or bonuses and stuff like that? >> Yeah. So marketing director and client success director are like the full-time, right?

### 📚 セクション 91

They're essentially like they're part of the team. they're handling everything that we need, right? In terms of I would say performance, the way we like to do it is if we we have certain internal KPIs, right? Just like in terms of content that we want to hit, it's usually a percentage increase, right? Um just cuz content is so all over the place, it's a fair way of incentivizing.

### 🔖 セクション 92

So it's like let's say month one we generate like 50,000 views for the content. next month, if we're able to generate like 150,000 views, then we'll essentially do uh bonus percentage that comes from the contract. Yeah. Right. And and that's kind of how I like to monetize because I want to make sure that my team works with me for a long time because I take time to train them.

### 🎨 セクション 93

I want them to stick with me, >> but at the same time, I'm not risking something outside of my margins of what the contract is giving me. >> So, that's usually how I operate in terms of bonuses. Yeah, that's helpful to know. Um, I know a lot of the short form content stuff is very heavily incentivized by by various performance based things. So, that's that's good to know.

### 🚀 セクション 94

Um, mate, that's been freaking awesome. I think if anyone has has any any questions on that, they can they can chuck this into this transcript into chat to you and ask some more questions. But, uh, everything's there, guys. Like I said at the start, this thing is still really really untapped and honestly underhyped in my opinion. I think because of how how these rolled out and everyone's like, "Oh, okay.

### ⚡ セクション 95

they're not really where they need to be to have a have a strong like business use. But with anything, if you show up if you aim to show up right when things get good, then you're going to be behind, right? Like you've been doing this for like, you know, at some point you got to be early. And if you are never willing to commit to being early and like dealing with stuff when it's a little bit thorny or maybe it's not super clearly the market's not super defined, like until you can do that, you're never going to be able to get like the massive results and growth you want out of your career. >> Like you have to be early at some point.

### 🌟 セクション 96

You have to take a bet on something and be the one who's been there from in the trenches when like the AI guys who were doing it like a decade ago and even even longer ago. Putting in the work now and getting familiar with it. You can say the same thing for like AI agent workforces and multi- aent workflows and all of these things that are still very like cutting edge right now. It's like would you rather get in it now sort of have fun with it and see what you can do with it as is and then when it does the the sort of technology has those unlocks that we're waiting for. You're right there on the sidelines ready to go and start applying and making money with it.

### 🎬 セクション 97

So I really appreciate you coming on to to reveal this, bro. Um and obviously massive congrats on your success cuz it's obviously um been very welld deserved. And I'd also say, you know, I'll be in the comment section if people have questions because I know there's a lot. Like, >> yeah, >> I'm happy to answer. Um, and and it's like Liam said, I mean, we just dropped everything.

### 📋 セクション 98

Like, we dropped all the sauce. You have no excuse to leverage this and, you know, build the business from it. So, >> the next tip from here would be find some tutorials on YouTube and search up how to use hen to create short form. Like, people have like naden automation templates out on the stuff that you can probably get for free. like the all of the information is out there, guys.

### ⭐ セクション 99

It's literally you're put if you looked at the hard work that Hash had to put in here with like refining the offer, building the building the notion and SOPs out, like maybe you just aren't willing to do that. And if it is that, then that's fine. But like, let's be honest about it. Don't blame it on the tech. Don't blame it on the strategy.

### 📝 セクション 100

All the information is out there. You've just got it like injected into your brain over this past hour. So, there's no no excuse now. You either want it or you don't. Even on my own YouTube, like I've given away the entire process because I I want to work with like high ticket businesses, right?

### 💡 セクション 101

Seven, eight figure companies. They'll pay me for it, but I think anyone else that's a beginner entry level, >> I want to make it accessible for them. And I think it's it's definitely following like the same path that you did of like let's let's have more businesses win. Like why why gatekeep? So >> when you realize as an agency it is like physically impossible for you to like take this whole market yourself, you know, like >> yeah, [laughter] >> this is like >> this if if I found something that's working, I can keep doing it for my clients.

### 🔧 セクション 102

I can also like either build a SAS SAS tool around it or I can like how can I take this thing that I've learned that is getting good results for businesses? Well, I can teach other people how to do it. I can build a tool around it. It's like doesn't make sense to just like bet put place all your bets on trying to scale to the whole freaking moon and back with uh with this kind of offer. But yeah, mate, really really appreciate it.
