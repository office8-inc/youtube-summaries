## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

How have we not found a solution to cookie banners? An HTTP cookie has been around for like 30 years. And simply [music] put, when you visit a website, it stores your cookie in your browser so that the next time you visit, it sends stored information from that website back to the server. So like items in your checkout, for example. But around 20 years later, the GDPR in Europe was introduced, forcing websites to explicitly allow users to consent to data collection.

### 📋 背景・概要

And this is when the cookie banner on websites started to show up. And personally, I'm on the fence of this issue because a explicit privacy laws are great. No one wants to be tracked without knowing. But b the web is so annoying to use. [music] Like come on, really.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント
