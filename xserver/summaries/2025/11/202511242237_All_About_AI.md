## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so it's really easy to just think about Nana Banana Pro as just another image generator. Uh, but today I'm going to show you if you do that, you are probably missing out on some insane use cases. So, I just want to go through a bunch of different things I tested out over the weekend and share maybe this can give you some inspiration. So, yeah, let's just get going. So, the first thing I wanted to share with you was this.

### 📋 背景・概要

Uh, you can actually use a Nano Banana Pro to get like a visualization of how a code works and it's really good at it. So, I just want to show you here. This is my figure 8 uh drone flying code. So, this is the code that controls my small uh yeah, you probably can see it here. My small uh swarm drone to fly in like a 8 figure pattern.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, this is a 300 almost 400 lines of code and it's uh in Python. It's not insane complex, but there's a lot of stuff here. So, what I did, I copied this code here. I went over to yeah, Banana uh Banana Pro here or Nana Banana 2 Pro, I guess. And I just put the code in here as context, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

Okay. And I just said uh explain this code in a visual way so that a fifth grader can understand it infographic style. And I'm going to show you what we ended up with here because I think this was pretty good. Uh or more than pretty good to be honest. So, let's open this up here.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, we're going to do the full image. Uh yeah, I think that's probably it. Or maybe I can download it and open it up. Maybe that's better. And let's take a look here now.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, if we do this, you can see uh we start with kind of the first thing here. This is the gear we need, right? We need a drone. We need a flow deck sensor. And we have the the brain is going to be our the code, right?

### 🎯 応用例

And we have a pre-flight checklist. This is in the code. So, we're going to connect to the drone, check the eyes, and this is pretty well explained here, I think. And the goal, you can see this is kind of the lazy eight. So, we're going to fly in this eight figure pattern.

### 💭 考察

And we're going to do 50 cm above the ground. And how it flies the shape. This is kind of how we do it in the code. So we calculate two speed at once sideways forward back speed to get this uh figure 8 and mixing these speeds make smooth curves. Okay, keeping balance stabilization.

### 📌 まとめ

If the drone trip uh tilts the code will quickly say whoops, lean back to level to stay level. This is kind of how we stabilize it. And here you kind of see the mission timeline. So we have a start, take off, hover, uh execute, hover, wait, land, and finish. So all of this was just generated from uh the code and just a simple prompt and we got this here.

### ✅ 結論

So this was was for a fifth grader and it's just a such a nice explanation of how this code works. It's just insane to think about that you can do this now and every single text here there's no spelling errors or nothing like that. I guess maybe there are some few small issues but nothing that is stopping you from understanding what's happening. So I just wanted to start off with this because I thought it was very cool. So yeah uh taking a code explaining it in like a simple way with visualization is something you can try out.

### 📚 追加情報

Uh but let's move on. Let's go to the next use case I tested out over the weekend. So now uh I wanted to try something. So I took this Yeah, it's just an envelope, right? and I drew this physics problem here that it's going to try to solve on this simple envelope.

### 🔖 補足

So, I just took an image of this with my phone. I uploaded it and yeah, let me just go grab that image. So, it's this, right? So, you can see we have the image here. Whoa.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Uh, okay. So, we're just going to upload that image. And if I open it, you can see this is the image of my drawing. Yeah, here's my mug. And what we're going to do now is uh I have a prompt for this I wanted to try out.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So we're just gonna uh combine this with the prompt that is going to be uh solve this on a new envelope. Include both envelopes in the answer. The answer must be in the same imperfect pen handwriting as the input image. Okay. So what we're going to solve for is kind of the net force and the acceleration of the box here.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So yeah, let's just run this. So you can see we are on Nana Banana 3. Okay, perfect. So yeah, just going to let this run and let's see what we get back here. So remember, we wanted the the original envelope and we wanted a new envelope with the answer on.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay. Okay. So we had the solution here. So if we open this up now, let's do Yeah, that should be fine. Uh I guess we can download it just to view it a bit better.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So you can see uh it kind of covered up my original envelope, but that's fine. But here you can see the solution and it is in kind of my handwriting. Of course, this is pretty perfect, right? But you can see we ended up with 2.35 m/s squared and that is correct. That is the acceleration of the box here with this inputs.

### 📋 セクション 18

Okay, so that is pretty cool, right? So now I kind of have, you can see my envelope is kind of overlapping the original one. I still have my mug here and this is the solution. So, I just was so impressed by this. Uh, I can show you.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Yeah, I know this is the correct solution because I check it out and it just looks so good. If I just prompted this to be a bit more imperfect. Yeah, I don't know. I don't think I could because now it looks a bit too lined up. But other than that, that is just so cool.

### 📝 セクション 20

Right. So another thing Nanaban Pro does is that it doesn't only generate or edit images, it also has this reasoning capability uh that is powered by Gemini 3. So what we can do with that if you kind of think about it is that you can also do like two operations. You can do something as we did with the code or yeah we kind of we can do something before we actually get what we want. So what I went ahead did here is I have like a big list of ingredients.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, we have meat, chicken, ground beef, we have pasta, cheese, we have uh paprika, black pepper, salt. Right. So, what I'm just going to do here is I'm going to prompt it create a dynamic menu with three dishes uh from today's fresh ingredients. Uh create an image of the menu with three dishes. Make it look like an American diner style vertical menu for my restaurant.

### 🔧 セクション 22

All about AI dinner. Diner, sorry. Okay. So let's see what uh if you look at the thoughts here you can see uh it kind of went through all the the ingredients to first create some dishes three specific dishes chicken sandwich pasta dish and a rice bowl and we ended up with this. So this was our menu.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So basically just from the ingredients and um the prompt we ended up with this. So, let me open this and we can see this is the all about AI dinner. So, we got the headline. That's pretty cool. And we have the algorithm chicken melt, a toasted bioche bun overflowing with grilled chicken breast slice.

### 💭 セクション 24

And you can see we get the image here. And you can kind of see the avocado. You can see the cheese. We even get a price. And next is kind of the binary beef pasta bowl.

### 📌 セクション 25

Uh a hearty bowl of pasta. You can see we have some ground beef. Perfect. Everything that looks to be in the image is in the menu here. If you get some pricing.

### ✅ セクション 26

And finally, we have the data crunch rice bowl. A bed of fluffy basmati rice topped with seasoned ground beef, sauteed onions, and some avocado pesto majo or something like that. Mayo. Okay. So, that is pretty cool, right?

### 📚 セクション 27

So that took you like how would I say like maybe 10 30 seconds to generate like today's menu based on the ingredients you kind of have in your restaurant, right? And you get this very cool dinner you could probably just print out or something and put in your restaurant. That is just insane, right? Uh so that is one thing I thought about testing out this weekend. I was super impressed by this.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So let's check out something else. So, I think last week Nvidia had their Q3 uh financial results uh or something and uh I just downloaded this PDF from their yeah uh announcement and I just went over to uh Nana Banana Pro here. I pasted in or uploaded the full PDF. So, I didn't extract anything. I just uploaded the full PDF because remember we also have the kind of the Gemini tree uh baked into this multimodel model.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So I said create a vertical infographic in Nvidia green and black that visualizes key points of the report that is easy to understand. Think uh an image is worth more than a thousand words. So this is the kind of the whole uh idea I wanted to kind of press on this video because sometimes you can get a lot of information compressed into an image and that is what Nana Banana is so good at, right? Compressing information into visuals that kind of saves on words, right? So let's see what we ended up with and I thought this was just brilliant.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So let me download this and blow it up a bit here. Okay. So, you can see we kind of get this record-breaking AI momentum. You can see the revenue is highlighted. So, 62% year-over-year.

### ⚡ セクション 31

We have the data center revenue. And if you scroll down here, you can see Blackwell sales are off the chart. This is a quote. That was pretty cool. And then it kind of goes into kind of the categories.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, data center and AI, gaming and AIPC, automotive and robotics. And you can see that is pretty cool. and the shareholder value and we get kind of the Q4 outlook. I wanted to see that because that is also very important. So we get like kind of an outlook $65 billion to gross margin 75%.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So just from the the financial report we get this visualization in just one prompt that is pretty crazy and yeah I don't really know what to say. I'm just so impressed by this model. We have come such a long way uh from the first image model I started playing around with in 2022. It's just insane. So yeah, I have a few more use cases I wanted to share.

### 📋 セクション 34

So let's dive in. Another thing Nana Banana Pro is so good at is kind of taking one concept and turning it into kind of something uh yeah for visual learning. So you can see we have this code here and there's an error in this code. You can see we have a list that only has two index zero and one. But when we run this uh index in a for loop and we set the range to five, this is going to of course get out of range, right?

### ⭐ セクション 35

Because if we try to run this now, so python banana.py, you can see we get this uh list index out of range. So let's say you haven't done any coding before, but you're starting to learn, you wanted to see, okay, what actually happens here. So let's try to find out what happens. So let's just copy this uh error code, right? And we have the code here.

### 📝 セクション 36

So, I just want to combine those and put those into Nana Banana Pro. And here I'm just going to say uh create an infographic uh crime scene that visualizes the errors of a fifth grader can understand it. Okay, so let's try that. So, let's run this in an Banana Pro because uh again, Nana Banana will understand what the code is trying to do. We have the error message and everything.

### 💡 セクション 37

So let's see how easy it kind of try can explain now uh why this error appears when you run this in Python. Okay. So you can see we have the response here. So let's take a bit of a closer look at this now. So you can see this is how uh Nana Banana came up with kind of how to explain why we get this error.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So we have a crime. The loop tried to grab the evidence that wasn't there. The list only has two items zero and one but the loop went too far. Okay. So we can see uh in index one we have the apple in index two or index zero we have the apple in index one we have the banana and here is the limit this is the end of the list uh but uh checking index 2 3 oh there was no evidence on index 2 so we were out of range and the lesson is don't cast uh count past the end of your list so that is why we got the error it's just so clever coming up with these things and I want to show you we have I had one more iteration of this.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So this was the second one. So you can see the case of the missing list item a Python mystery. Okay. And you can see it started on index zero. Yeah, I found the apple on index one.

### 💭 セクション 40

I found the banana. Index two. No house. Well, crash. So here there was no house.

### 📌 セクション 41

So it couldn't find uh anything here. Lesson how to fix it. Stop the loop before it's too late. Don't count past the end of your list. Okay, so we also get some tips here.

### ✅ セクション 42

Remember list starts at zero. So a list of two item has indexes zero and one only. That's pretty good. So yeah, just a awesome way of learning things. And just think about how you can teach uh kids and stuff with things like this.

### 📚 セクション 43

So another thing I wanted to try out was to take this uh paper here from andon labs the butterbange paper and I just uploaded this. So this is kind of the full paper here. Uh where was it? Yeah, it was over here I think and I just put in create a summary of the paper uh on a professor's whiteboard in handwriting. Okay.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So let's see what we ended up with here. So you can see uh I guess I can download this and if we pull this over here you can see we have like this big visual uh what do I call it like a whiteboard and it kind of summarize everything from the paper and it was pretty cool. I kind of read through I'm not going to go through everything here but you kind of see the takeaway is current LLM lack context and common sense for real world not deployment ready need better safety protocols. So that is kind of the takeaway and you can see we have kind of the concept and method key results and failures insights and red teaming and again just a very cool way of uh taking some kind of yeah I guess it was a paper in this case and just turning it something that is much more suitable for doing some kind of visual presentation I think and again you just spend like 30 seconds so it's always worth it right you can even do multiple iterations on this and get something useful, I think. So, the last use case I want to show you today is uh playing around with blueprints.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So, let's say you had a blueprint of uh yeah, some house you want to buy or maybe want to build or it could be any blueprint. So, we have this image. Okay, this is of the first floor. We have like a 2,000 square meter. Yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Blueprint of a first floor here. So, what we can do now is we can upload this to Banana Pro and Yeah. Let me just find the image. So, let's just upload the blueprint and we can do the prompt. Turn this blueprint into a 3D prospect of the house with a view from different angles.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Okay. So, let's try that. And hopefully now we will get kind of this uh yeah this prospects you can get and we get some different images uh from the blueprint in like a 3D model style of how the house or the first floor I guess could look. Okay. So, we had the response here and this looks pretty cool.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So, let's open up this now. So, I'm just going to download this and let's take a look. So, let's try to see. So, yeah, this looks pretty good. Uh, of course, this is not 100% accurate, but you can see kind of the front part of the house.

### 🎬 セクション 49

We have the car or the garage to the right, and we have kind of the entrance. And on the back, we kind of have this porch here that was from the blueprint. I guess this was a bit strange. And the final part was just uh yeah, how it could look inside, I guess. So again, not perfect, but pretty good just from a blueprint, I would say.

### 📋 セクション 50

So if you go back and look at kind of the blueprint, yeah, it kind of looks somewhat accurate. We have the great room. We have the dining table to the right there. And then we have the porch. Let's have a look.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Uh yeah, I guess so. We have the dining table here. Uh, there was a Yeah, that's that was a bit strange to be honest. But again, maybe I could have prompted this a bit better, but it is pretty cool to play around with these blueprints I found out. And at the end, I just want to have like a bonus thing because uh I've been working on some presentation I'm going to do next week.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, you can see I have just some uh this is kind of my uh workflow I do. So I would just ask Nano Banana to create uh six decks or like slide decks uh of this workflow and in one prompt I got this back. So I got the first slide. This is the vibe coding workflow deck one. I got deck two, three, four, five and six in just one prompt.

### 💡 セクション 53

So these are like kind of like ready images. I can just slide right into my presentation and that's like a big timesaver. Uh, I don't have to prompt every single slide. I can just do one everything in one prompt. And yeah, that is just so cool.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So, I just think this is the beginning of what we can do with Nana Banana Pro. There's just a bunch of more things we need to explore to figure out how we can integrate this into our workflow. Uh, but so far I just been so impressed and I having having a blast playing around with this. And yeah, like I said, I was I'm going to explore more. I'm going to share my findings.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So, if you like this video, give it a like and look out for the next one.
