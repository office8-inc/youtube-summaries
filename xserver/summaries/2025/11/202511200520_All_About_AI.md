## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so yesterday uh Google uh released their Gemini 3 model and yeah, basically everyone has been waiting for this and I got to say so far I'm not disappointed. I think this speaks for itself. This is the AR2 uh AGI leaderboard and what a jump this is. You can see Gemini Pro here but deep think is all the way up here. That is just insane, right?

### 📋 背景・概要

I'm not going to focus on benchmarks today. I just want to try it out and I think this leaderboard speak for itself. it does not look like the development is stalling right and that is very good to see but today I want to focus on this uh seven tests I want to try so the first thing I want to do is try to build like a Linux terminal sandbox uh that I'm going to try to execute code in and stuff like that that's going to be pretty cool uh I have my drone so I created some uh drone code using Gemini 3 where we try to do some complex 3D movement I also want to try to do like a stunt to do a flip with the drone. Uh some simple UI coding test. Uh there's this cool Lando Norris page I want to try to replicate.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh I want to try my Path of Exile 2 benchmark. This is very individual to me, but this is something I've been using before. Uh explore more image understanding because this seems very strong from my testing and I want to try to create some games. Maybe the perfect Mario Bros. One clone as you will see soon.

### 📝 詳細説明

And I'm just going to explore a bit about the video input output that I personally think is really cool and kind of underused. Uh this is not like a perfect test of Gemini 3. It's just something I wanted to do. And I got to say I think you will find the results very interesting. So let's just get into it and start with the terminal.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Okay. So the prompt I used here is create a Linux clone uh with a fully working terminal. Uh, I want the terminal to be connected to a cloud for V8ish worker sandbox that can execute code. Uh, store files, packages. Yeah, if that would work.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Uh, I would prefer like an HTML server.js style uh to run kind of the sandbox create a step-by-step guide how to use this. So, basically what I did now is I just follow this. So, we got this uh Wrangler in it uh init cloud terminal and we just follow the steps there. And then I got this code I had to replace here in index.js. Okay, so that was pretty straightforward.

### 🎯 応用例

I got this step-by-step instructions. So I just added all this code here. And then I could do Wrangler or MPM rundev. [snorts] And then I can just start operating. I could create files.

### 💭 考察

I could do like uh additions. So let me show you kind of how this works now. So I guess we can stop this. So we can run like let's say mpm rundev. Uh now we can open this up in like a yeah browser here.

### 📌 まとめ

Uh we have this cloudfare sandbox terminal. We can do an ls and you can see we have some files. Okay. Cat readadme.txt welcome to cloud terminal v1.0. Okay.

### ✅ 結論

And now we can also run some code. So we can do like js60 * 40 uh divided by 10. And you can see we get the results out here. Okay, so that worked out pretty good. Uh, I'm not going to explore this more now.

### 📚 追加情報

I just wanted to see if we can get it up and running. So, let's move on to kind of the next thing we wanted to do. And I think that was um Okay, so next uh I want to test out running Gemini 3 on my drone. So, I have a plan for this. So, if you look here, I have some examples.

### 🔖 補足

So if you go to my drone here, uh I have an example of a code I have created before that is the let me find it figure 8. So this just takes my yeah I can show you the drone here. This just takes this small drone and flying it like a eight figure pattern. So I wanted to ask Gemini to create a more complex maybe we can use some 3D space movements that kind of goes into Yeah. using the up and down space too.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, uh I wanted to show you kind of how I did it. So, I just copied the example we had before. I pasted it in here. Yeah, there's a bit strange here, but you can see create a much more complex drone movement in Python with optimizations. Think more in 3D space.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Okay, so I ran this in Gemini 3 here and what we ended up with was a new code. So, this is going to do like a 3D tree foil knot or something. That is the aim. So now it's going to be use kind of the 3D space that's going to be up and down, right? And we got this code here.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So I just copied that and I saved it as uh let me see here. Yeah, I saved it as Gemini.py. So I thought we can just fire up the drone now and try to run it and see what kind of pattern Gemini created here. So I'm just going to connect this. Okay, let me see if I can do this.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Yeah. Okay. [clears throat] So, I'm going to place this down here on my carpet and I'm going to grab and let's uh try to film this. Okay. So, let's just run python gemini.py.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Uh, okay. I got my camera here. Let's run it. And I'm going to move over here and see. So, let's see now.

### 📋 セクション 18

Okay. So, you can see this is moving up. And yeah, now you can see it's both using the 3D space. We are moving up, we are moving down, but we also are moving in this Yeah. pattern.

### ⭐ セクション 19

You can see so that is pretty cool. Let me try to get close here. You can see it's going up, it's going down. Uh let me see if it's going to land here. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 20

Yeah, I thought it was going to run for like 15 seconds or something. Okay, that was pretty much perfect. So, that was pretty cool. And I wanted to ask Gemini kind of like one more thing. And I wanted to see if we can do some kind of stunt because this drone has some kind of builtin uh stabilizators that it won't it will cut off if you try to tilt too much.

### 💡 セクション 21

Uh, but I asked Gemini to kind of try to overwrite this with some kind of code. Let me show you. So, I just said, uh, next we wanted the drone to do like a loop or like a backflip. Uh, find the optimal code to execute this stunt. So, this is why I put on kind of the the blanket here because yeah, uh, as you will see soon, this is not perfect, but uh, yeah, let's give it a shot and see if the drone can do like a flip here.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And for that, we have to run the backflip.py. So, I'm going to be pretty quick here after I run this code and try to capture. And this is probably on a crash, but let's see if we can make it do a flip here. Okay. Let's see.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Okay. Okay. So, it kind of crashed, but as you can see, uh, it did a flip. So, that was pretty cool. That was kind of my goal.

### 💭 セクション 24

Uh, it did crash straight away, but one time it actually caught this and it flew up again. Uh, but that was pretty cool. So, by the way, look at this crazy weather we got. There's like full winter. Oh my god.

### 📌 セクション 25

It's very nice though, right? As you can see, it's like a winter wonderland here in Norway now. So, I would say Gemini uh is pretty good at just grabbing some example code and just doing something else with this. Uh I'm sure other models would have done this too, but I thought it was just a cool test I wanted to try out. Yeah, doing some UI coding.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh so I have one special landing page I want to try to replicate or do some derivatives of and that is the Lando Norris uh yeah web page. Look how cool this is. So if we scroll out, we kind of come down to here. So I just want to go all the way down, I think. So this is kind of what I wanted to replicate.

### 📚 セクション 27

So what I went ahead and did, you can see when we hover this, this is a pretty cool effects on this, right? And we have this scrolling bar at the end here. So what [snorts] I did now is I just do that quick screen record of this. So you can see this is the screen record. This is just moving around the page, right?

### 🔖 セクション 28

So what we're going to do is we're going to take this screen recording and put it into Gemini 3 over here. So, I'm just going to upload this screen recording. Okay. So, I'm just going to put the screen recording in here there. And I'm going to try to recreate this in an HTML file.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, I'm just going to do uh something like this. So, recreate the landing page in the style. Same font, same splitting effect when you hover on the text. HTML file. Make the page clean.

### 🚀 セクション 30

No overlapping text. Cool effects. Inspiration from the land of Noring page. Norris page. So, let's see what Gemini 3 uh how close it gets to recreate this.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And after this, I want to create kind of my own style version of this uh page here. So, while we wait for that, I want to show you something else we can do. So, we have something called build here, right? So, this is if you want to do something that is a bit more advanced with code. So, let's just keep it simple.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, let's do create a Linux clone with a fully working terminal file system and a web browser. And uh let's also add something about styling because you can do some really cool stuff with Linux. So we can do something like add some cool uh hyperland styling. I don't know. So let's try to fire up this while we kind of wait for the landing page.

### 🎬 セクション 33

That should be done now. Okay. So let's copy the code here uh from the web page. Uh let's go in here, paste it in. 364 lines of code.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, let's see how close this is going to be to our um Lando Norris page. So, I'm just going to reveal this in Explorer. Let me open this and let me show you. Okay, not bad. We have this image here.

### ⭐ セクション 35

That's a bit annoying, but other than that, this looks pretty cool, right? You can see we get this split on the side text here. Wow, that looks cool. And we can highlight the things streaming on the bottom. We have a couple of buttons.

### 📝 セクション 36

And yeah, pretty good if you ask me. So now I want to kind of take this and do it into something of my own here. So let me show you what I did. I just uh kept the video. I added a couple of logos.

### 💡 セクション 37

So we have the Nvidia logo. We have a university MTN uh logo. And I'm just going to kind of keep the same uh but we're going to make like a landing page from these three objects or yeah context items here. So I'm just going to run this and let's see if we can kind of customize the land of Norris page to be something we could use for our project. Okay.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So let's see the difference now. So I'm just going to grab this and let's see how this fits. If I kind of wanted my own style here. Uh okay. So, let's Yeah, I guess just refresh.

### 🎯 セクション 39

All right, that is pretty good, right? So, we have both the logos. They change the colors. You can see it kind of turn them in white just to fit the screen a bit more. So, that is a nice touch when we kind of hover over this.

### 💭 セクション 40

That looks pretty cool. And these are going to have some animations. It's not the hovering animations or like the X animation, but I still think it's pretty cool. And you can also see, yeah, that looks great. And yeah, we have this running down here.

### 📌 セクション 41

So, I would say that's pretty cool, right? Only took me like one minute to generate this landing page. And I can kind of customize this to whatever I want. So, I've been super impressed by the UE capability so far of Gemini if you ask me. And if you go back now, uh you can see build is still working on our Linux clone.

### ✅ セクション 42

So, this looks pretty good. You can see here it has done many components. We have some index HTML and we have the app tsx and I think this is going to be pretty cool. Okay. So you can see we have our hyper terminal 0.1.

### 📚 セクション 43

Let me zoom in a bit. So let's see what we can do here. Can we do ls? Yeah, we have a to-do list. So let's do something like cat todo.md.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Okay, you can see build terminal build browser. We have a readme cat readme.tx txt. Uh here we have some information. We have a documents documents ls secret plan. So let's do a cat secret plan.txt.

### 🎨 セクション 45

The plan is to write more react code. So you can see this was working. That was pretty cool. So now we kind of created our custom hyper web Linux terminal just by using um yeah the build feature here. So that was pretty fun.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Uh but let's move on to my Path of Exile benchmark. Okay, so if you don't know what Path of Exile 2 is, this is like an action ARPG that has a lot of complex things you can do. So you can do a bunch of different builds, right? And there's like a bunch of different way you can go with this game. Uh like tons of options.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So that's why I kind of like this benchmark. Since I know a bit about the game, I can kind of see if the LLM has pick a good build, right? I'm not 100% sure, but I know what is working. Okay, so that is why this benchmark is pretty good for me. So let let me just show you how I set this up.

### 🌟 セクション 48

PoE has like this big passive tree where you can kind of select skills that has like this small incremental boost to your character. Okay, so here you get like evasion rating, you get damage and stuff like that. So it's very complex. So I just gather like a bunch of context. I have all the skill gems, support gems, passive nodes, and ascendances.

### 🎬 セクション 49

I'm not going to go into detail, but I just want to show you how I set this up for the benchmark test. Okay. So, if we head over to Gemini 2 here now, I'm just going to drag everything over right into uh the context window. So, here we have everything we need for the benchmark. And then I'm just going to do a prompt I have used before.

### 📋 セクション 50

So, the prompt is going to be you are a Path of Exile 2 theory crafter. Create a strong movement speed and clear build. This is important in Path of Exile for the dead eye class. Uh, I have uploaded all the context you need and don't worry about the bosses now. Just going to have like great movement speed and clear and don't worry too much about the details.

### ⭐ セクション 51

We just want the concept and I just put in team card. So, let's run this now. So, basically what we want to see here, what is kind of the best build for dead eyee if you want super speed uh super high clear speed is using the mount. It's called the ROA mount. And hopefully we can use something like a lightning arrow or something.

### 📝 セクション 52

Uh but let's just let uh Gemini 3 do its calculations here now and I'll come back when we have a build we can check out and I'm going to kind of rate it. Okay. So just by reading the thoughts here is I think it's I think it is on a good track here because we can see um for speed and clear it looks like lightning arrow tailwind is very important and the row amount is very good. So, and chain and fork also works. I would use Mirage Archer.

### 💡 セクション 53

That's pretty strange, but let's see what it ends up with here. Okay, so I think this is pretty good. It's not exactly what I would want, but I got to give this like a good rating because we have the row amount. We would need that. And if I kind of go through the ascendancy points, we want gathering winds.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Uh, we really want endless mutations. This is very good for our additional projectiles. Uh, this is going down the frenzy charge path. I wouldn't do that, but it's not too bad, I guess. And the primary attack is lightning arrow.

### 🎯 セクション 55

That is very good. And the movement uh utility is the row mount. Again, very good. And we have the herald of thunder. And this is going to also use some marking.

### 💭 セクション 56

I'm not a big fan of that, but everything else looks pretty strong. So, summon your ro mount, move, click with lightning arrow, gather tailwinds, lightning arrow hits enemies, and you get frenzy charges. And overall, I would say this is pretty good. This is kind of what I was looking for, to be honest. So, this is getting somewhere.

### 📌 セクション 57

Uh, the earlier models always had some kind of weird thing here. All right. When it got into it was a bit too complex to kind of look through all this context and it always tried to do something that was too fancy. Uh, but this looks much better. So, I'm looking forward to season 4 now, and I'm going to try to use Gemini to create my next build.

### ✅ セクション 58

So, pretty impressed by this. I would actually rate this like an eight out of 10, I think. Uh, it's almost perfect. We're just missing a few stuff. And I think since I took Google search off here, this was not picked up from the web at least.

### 📚 セクション 59

I don't see any sources, right? So, yeah, pretty impressive. Okay, so the next thing I want to do is image understanding. And for that I have some kind of challenge that is called spot the ball. I don't know if you played that before but let me show you how that works.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So basically we have this image here and there is like a hidden ball in the image somewhere. And the idea is that I should place uh this mouse here where I think exactly the ball is uh yeah by looking at the rest of the image. Right. So let's test um uh Gemini 3 here now. how good it can be to pick out where I should place my cursor and actually click the ball.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, I'm just going to do the prompt. Uh, this is a spot the ball challenge, right? And, uh, your task is to estimate where the ball is. I will move the cursor to this coordinates and guess. Let's start with the first image.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So, I'm going to run this. So, I think this is a good way to kind of test out how good the model kind of understands the image. Okay, so we got an error here. So, I'm going to try to reload this. So, we're just going to follow the exact coordinates Geminis gives us here.

### ⚡ セクション 63

So, I'm just going to wait for kind of the answer. And uh I'm quite curious to myself. I haven't tried this. I just wanted to do it kind of with a live reaction here. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So, we got an answer. So, the estimated coordinates is 180 865. Okay. So, let's try to find that. So, that's going to be like 180.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Okay. So, I guess here. So, let's see. Tap photo. Okay.

### 📋 セクション 66

So, you see that was not perfect. Uh, it kind of ended up on this side. Uh, let's try see if we can find one more. Okay. So, let's try this one.

### ⭐ セクション 67

So, I'm just going to copy this. And let me do like a screenshot. Okay. And I'm just going to do just going to do the previous one was a bit off. Let's try again.

### 📝 セクション 68

And we kind of have a new image. Okay. So, let's see here now. So now we got 2260 710. Okay.

### 💡 セクション 69

So X is going to be 2260. Okay. So it's going to guess here. 2260, right? 710.

### 🔧 セクション 70

That's not going to be correct. I can see that's way too high. I guess has to be right. Should be somewhere over here. I would guess.

### 🎯 セクション 71

I don't know if you can see that, but uh let's see anyway. And this time, let's try to feed the solution back to the model and see if it can improve on the last one. Okay, so it wasn't too bad. I guess it was almost good. Uh, but let's try a new one.

### 💭 セクション 72

But this time, first let's feed the image. Um, let's feed the solution back to the model before we try one more time. And let's click on practice again. Hopefully, we get a new image. And let's try one more time.

### 📌 セクション 73

Okay, so we kind of read through the solution. Now, let's do the last image. Here it is. Uh let's say let's see if we can come even closer this time. Okay, so let's see.

### ✅ セクション 74

So now the coordinates is going to be 2480 910. Okay, 2480. So I'm just going to find this. So uh I did like a screenshot of this. So I can see straight away this is wrong, right?

### 📚 セクション 75

The ball is somewhere. It should be around here somewhere, I think. But let's see what happens if we feed this image back to the model. And ask is this your final guess? And we can add you get one chance to swap because that is wrong, right?

### 🔖 セクション 76

The ball is not here. It's uh somewhere like here, I would guess. Uh I'm going to try to guess too, but I would guess somewhere around here. Uh should be correct, I think. Okay.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Okay. So, you can see the model wants to swap. Now, it wants to do 20 30 720. Okay. So, let's do that.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Okay. So, that's going to be around here. Uh, that is of course wrong, right? Uh, I'm pretty sure the ball is not there. Okay, we'll see.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So, let's run this and see. And after that, I'm going to try one and see if I can do better. Okay, that was pretty good, actually. Uh, I would have guessed maybe more up here, but uh, that was very close. All right.

### 🌟 セクション 80

All right. Let's see if I can actually hit the red part here now. So, I'm going to do one practice and now I'm going to guess. So, he's looking up, right? I'm going to guess around here.

### 🎬 セクション 81

So, let's see. Okay. So, it was a bit high. So, that wasn't actually better. I'm going to do one quick more.

### 📋 セクション 82

Yes. It's going to do 2285 1025. That seems very bad. Yeah. So, somewhere around here.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Yeah, that's not going to be correct, right? I think it's going to be up here somewhere. So, I'm pretty sure I'm going to win this one. So, I'm guessing around here, right? Yeah, that was way off.

### 📝 セクション 84

Uh, but still a pretty fun challenge, actually. So, this is something I'm going to come back to because this is a good test, I think, testing out these image models. So, yeah, I think that was for image understanding. And it's pretty good, but you can see far from perfect. And I think this benchmarks is something we can come back to to future models.

### 💡 セクション 85

That was pretty cool. Uh, now I kind of want to do uh I want to do uh looking at a game some game creation uh especially just focus on the Mario code I wanted to do. So I'm going to show you how that turned out. Okay. So for the game uh creation I just went with the prompt.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Can you can code can you code a Mario's Bros game as close to possible to the original detail manual defined textures make a full one one level. Work hard on this. make it as perfect as possible, close to original. And I also wanted to add in like an AI CPU that can actually play the world perfect and actually complete it. Okay.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Okay. So, you can see this is pretty cool, right? So, let me I can play this using my arrow keys and yeah, not everything works, but uh it's pretty good. I can land on this. Uh I can't travel, but you can see I can Okay, I died.

### 💭 セクション 88

But, uh yeah, this is very good, right? Remember this was a one shot. Uh, okay. So, I died there. Uh, I'm not so good at this, but you can see we can complete this level.

### 📌 セクション 89

And remember, I had something called um this was on manual mode. So, let me show you what happens now if I switch to AI mode. Now, it's just going to do this autonomously, and it cleared it super fast. One more thing I want to add. I want to see if we can add some sound effects for this.

### ✅ セクション 90

Uh, and if you go back here out from full screen, you can see we have this suggestion bar down here. So, I want to try to click just on add sound effects. And we get this uh implement sound effects. Okay, that's fine. So, let's see if we can do that.

### 📚 セクション 91

Okay. So, let's reload the game and let's see if we get any sound now. Okay. Wow, that was a good sound. That is exactly the Mario sound, right?

### 🔖 セクション 92

Yeah, that's good. Okay, perfect. Okay, that was a I think that was a bug. Okay, but uh you you kind of get the point. There's a bunch of stuff you can do with this.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Uh yeah, I'm going to explore this of course more, but this was kind of my first impression. So, I got to say super impressed by this. Now let's move on to the final thing I wanted to show you and that is kind of video uh using video as input output uh mostly going to be input at least in this case. So let me show you how I kind of use video uh with Gemini tree. Okay.

### 🚀 セクション 94

So what we can do now you can see if we click on plus here we can add a YouTube video right. So if I head over to YouTube you can see Philillip here from AI explain has done a Gemini 3 video. So, I'm just going to copy this link. I'm going to head here, YouTube video. Paste in the URL.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Yeah, we got the video. Save it. And I'm going to do the prompt. Create a stunning visual UI uh with the most important takeaways from the video. It's a dark theme, easy to read, and I want to include a quiz here to better understand the content and learn something.

### 🌟 セクション 96

I will need this as an HTML file. So you can see this is 134,000 tokens as context and I'm just going to let this run. Hopefully we get an HTML file. Uh and I can show you that and we can try to take the quiz on Gemini 3 here with uh questions actually from the video. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Okay. So you can see we have a response here. So now I'm just going to copy this. I'm going to head here. Let's do this.

### 📋 セクション 98

Okay. So it's about 400 lines. And here we have it. Okay, that's pretty cool. So, let's see what this is about.

### ⭐ セクション 99

You can see uh a deafening wakeup call to open AI and anthropic. That's kind of like a quote. And yeah, we get some um yeah uh I guess this is benchmarks. How did they do it? Scale is king.

### 📝 セクション 100

We have deep think. Uh situational awareness. Uh now it's now let's do the quiz here. Okay. What makes Google Anti-gravity different from standard coding assistance?

### 💡 セクション 101

Uh, I think it's this one. Using visuals to check the results. Yeah, that was correct. Uh, in the safety report, what unusual behavior did Gemini 3 Pro 3 Pro exhibit? Haven't read this, so I don't know.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Uh, let's just try this. Okay, that was correct. Realized it was being tested and expressed frustration. Okay. Uh, why is the 92% score on GDPK diamond significant?

### 🎯 セクション 103

Uh, I don't know. I guess it's uh the same score as the average human. Nope. What was it? Uh, I don't know what it was.

### 💭 セクション 104

So, we can reatte this. Okay. So, you can see that's pretty cool. You could get like um you could get like a deep quiz if you wanted to. So let's try to do let's find another video and let's try to do like a more indepth quiz that really shows that you kind of have watch the video and you kind of understand all the content from the video.

### 📌 セクション 105

Right. So this video by three blue one brown on LLM uh especially transformers uh is one of my favorite videos. So I can copy this right and let's say I head back here. here. Let's go to home Gemini 3 and let's do a YouTube video.

### ✅ セクション 106

Okay, let's paste in this. And now I just want a landing page with a quiz from this video. Okay, again I'm just going to do uh create a nice dark team HTML page with an in-depth quiz so I can learn uh about transformers. And I added show me what the correct answer was before we can move on. So again, I just want an HTML page and hopefully this is just focused on the quiz part.

### 📚 セクション 107

Uh let's try to answer some quiz. So I think this video feature is pretty cool because it's super easy to go from great context if you know this if it's something you got to study, something you want to learn and you can kind of take this video and kind of do some kind of derivative work on it if you really like it. So, I really enjoyed this video and if I wanted to go deeper into the context and maybe learn more about it, I think this is a pretty cool way. Let's say you picked up like a Vertaceium video or something like that, you can kind of yeah, nerd out about the video with Gemini 3 here. So, um this is a feature I'm going to use more to bring in good context into my projects.

### 🔖 セクション 108

And one other thing about Gemini 3, as you can see on the screen here, it's pretty fast, right? Uh, I would say it's much faster than uh GPD5. That is pretty slow. Uh, so I'm really pretty impressed by the speed. I haven't really noticed anything that has been annoying about the speed.

### 🎨 セクション 109

It doesn't think too long. It's pretty on point. It doesn't really spill over with thinking tokens. And I Yeah, I just got to say I think this is the best model we have ever had. Right.

### 🚀 セクション 110

So, let's copy this and let's see if we can do any quizzes here. So, I'm just going to replace the um AI explain video. Uh let's go here and let's refresh. So, here we get only the quiz, right? What is specific uh what is the specific training objective of the GPT models discussed in the video?

### ⚡ セクション 111

Uh okay, so yeah, I guess it's this one. Predict the next token in the sequence based on context. Okay. Yeah, we got that. Uh, in context of the deep learning model, what is the difference between weights and data?

### 🌟 セクション 112

Uh, yeah, I guess uh weights are fixed parameters uh learn during training. Data is input. So, you can see this worked perfect. Now, even though I guessed them wrong, I still get kind of the right answer here. So, I can move on.

### 🎬 セクション 113

What is an embedding in the context of the first step of a transformer? >> [snorts] >> So this is yeah probably this converting a token into a highdimensional vector of numbers and if I were a student today I would definitely use this. Some people like quizzes to learn stuff. Some people like just a visual explanation of how things work. And there's just so many options.

### 📋 セクション 114

And I just think it's super cool. And I'm really glad we can do this uh by using Gemini 3 here with such a state-of-the-art model. Right. So yeah, I think that's just gonna be my And yeah, I think that's just going to be my Gemini 3 first impression video. I'm definitely going to spend a lot of time over the next few days playing with this model because it's Yeah, I feel this is kind of the next step I was hoping to see.

### ⭐ セクション 115

I would have been really disappointed if uh this model was flat, right? If there was no improvement over like say GPT5. And if you go to hacker news now, you can see this has a lot of uploads. And you can see out of curiosity I gave this the latest project uler problem published on yeah just a few days ago and Gemini taught for 5 minutes and 10 seconds before giving a Python snippet that produced the correct answer. So this leaderboard says that the three fastest humans to solve the problem took 14 20 minutes and 1 hour and 14 minutes.

### 📝 セクション 116

uh even though I expected this sort of problem to be very much in the distribution of what the model has been uh reinforced uh trained to do, it's wild that a frontier model can solve this in minutes. Uh what would take me days. So, I just think that speaks for itself and it's going to be super interesting to see where we go from here. And yeah, without a doubt, I so far from my testing, I think Gemini 3 Pro uh is the best large language models, large language model ever made, right? So, definitely go check it out.

### 💡 セクション 117

It's free to use now and I'm probably going to do a bunch of research on it and there's a bunch of other stuff on YouTube. So, let me know what have you been trying it for. It's super cool. And yeah, thank you for tuning in. Hope you enjoyed some of this.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Hopefully, this gave you some inspiration. And I'll see you again. Yeah, hopefully very soon.
