## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

See, nobody is really safe because we're all going to get replaced. No matter what your job is, if it's a plumber, content creator, like recently notebook made me realize that even I am not safe, you know, because I was flying from Poland to Ireland and normally I would just listen to YouTube podcast, but on this flight I prepared multiple Notebook LM recordings and I would just listen to that. was like, "Oh my god, this is exactly what I do. AI educational content, right?" So, people think like it's going to be programmers or customer support or truck drivers. Yeah, those are the most obvious jobs, but none of us are safe.

### 📋 背景・概要

No matter what your business is, no matter what your job is, you need to think deeply about what the next few years will look like because change is coming and nothing is clear, nothing is certain and we're going to have to rethink everything from first principles. You know, even the business models are going to be changing. For example, SAS software as a service is nowhere near as good as it used to be. In the past, you developed some software and then you launched it and every extra user would be basically free, right? Because the margins would be like 98%.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Just amazing. But now with API costs, the costs scale linearly with new users. So you have to pay for the tokens for each new user, which massively destroys margin of SAS. So we will have to think about pricing models, business models, products and services. And the problem is when something starts working really well, the AI labs just replace you, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

We see this with OpenAI and Infropic all the time. Like OpenAI just created agent kit, which is their N10 clone. Infropic released cloud code, which you know was competing with Cursor. Like the foundational lab companies, if your startup is working well, they will just replace you. So that's another challenge that needs to be figured out.

### 💡 実例・デモ

>> Yeah. Yeah. And another benefit of everything that's going on right now is that everything is possible now. >> Yeah. Everything is possible.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

That's true. So I don't, you know, you can be too pessimistic, but you can also be too optimistic. For example, learning. No matter what you're trying to learn, you can learn it now 10 times faster than before. And that's not an overexaggeration.

### 🎯 応用例

In fact, that might be an understatement. With tools like Notebook LM, with tools like Deep Research, you can just learn concepts so fast. For example, what I like to do is when I'm reading, I just use GBD51 Pro to ask questions, right? A reasoning model that can answer any question, no matter what you're trying to do. If you're trying to, you know, improve your vocabulary, if you're trying to understand a topic deeply, with current AI models, you can learn so fast, it's actually crazy.

### 💭 考察

Another thing is coding. Obviously, especially if you watch this channel, you already know with AI, you can literally build anything with plain English, cursor, codec, cloud code, doesn't matter what you use, right? Even lovable like all of these tools can build great software just by you typing in plain English, describing your idea. All you need is vision, right? I think the future is going to belong to those who are the most adaptable and the people who work hardest, you know, the action takers.

### 📌 まとめ

If you're someone who just watches AI and sits on the sidelines, you're not going to have a good time over the next 10 years. No matter what your job is, no matter what your position is. But if you're someone who constantly learns, constantly tries to improve, works hard, is proactive, then it's almost like the quote like if you're worried, you don't have to be you don't have to worry, right? If you worry, you don't have to worry because you're constantly trying to look at dangers and mistakes you might be making, opportunities you might be missing. But if you're one of these people who kind of chilling, you know, like comfortable, not trying to reinvent himself, then yeah, you should worry.

### ✅ 結論

You are in trouble. >> Especially since AGI is basically closer than ever, right? It's almost the most >> I mean, it's kind of crazy like this week, the last seven days, so much things have released, right? All of the companies are releasing stuff faster than ever. And really feels like we're speeding up.

### 📚 追加情報

And people don't realize we are living through the singularity. It's not like a single moment where you wake up and like, oh, today is AGI day. That's not how it works. Like all of these releases compound on top of each other, right? Gemini releases new model, open air releases new model, Enthropic releases new model.

### 🔖 補足

All of these things speed up the progress. And um if we look back, this might be the most important period in human history, right? Because now we can look at like the printing press which caused massive change because before that the average person couldn't read. They had to listen to a preacher who had like one Bible in the town. With with the invention of the printing press, everybody like books could be mass-produced, right?

### 🎨 セクション 13

Same with the steam engine which launched the first industrial revolution. Massive change which caused people to build great companies like Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Cornelius Vanderbilt. Those things were not possible before the steam engine. Now we're going to see this again, but on a completely different level.

### 🚀 セクション 14

With the first industrial revolution, it took like 200 years for the change to really be applied to the economy and to everyday people. With the AI revolution, that might be 20 years. It won't be instant, right? Don't listen to people like Sam Oldman or Dario Ammoday who like the hypeers like AGI 6 months away like some content creators make you believe. That's ridiculous.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Those people are just liars. And usually you can just think about from first principles what are their incentives right a lot of these CEOs and VCs and investors they benefit tremendously by hyping endlessly right like stock market goes up openai just wants to raise another found with enthropic they just want to hype up the potential of the technology to increase the size of the investment of their next funding round. So you always have to think about what people benefit and what are their incentives. But the technology is here, right? Like the progress is here.

### 🌟 セクション 16

It will just take longer than 6 months to get applied. Even if it's 20 years, that is still massive progress. And in the meantime, there will be some crazy companies created. And yeah, AGI is closer than ever, especially with the latest releases from Google. But u all companies are cooking right now.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And it's really crazy crazy time. >> So you don't think we're in a bubble? Well, the question is um stock market bubble or technology bubble, right? Like I don't think AI is a bubble because the technology is there. It's improving faster than ever.

### 📋 セクション 18

And it's actually amazing what you can do even with the current models. Like even if the improvement of AI stopped today, there would still be like a 5 year 10 year headwind of new applications, new solutions, new softwares created on top of the current AI. But if you're talking about stock market, that's entirely different thing because that, you know, that depends on the macroeconomic view. There is many companies that are grossly overpriced right now and who knows maybe there will be a recession maybe there will be a big painful crash but that doesn't mean anything about the underlying technology right it's the same with the blockchain blockchain is a incredible technology that allows you to decentralize stuff and it allows you to make things public like for example each government should have their payments on the blockchain so you can see where your taxes are going and how much money the government has and how much it collects But that doesn't mean there's not going to be like crashes in Bitcoin price or in Ethereum. Of course, like that's that's the market dynamics, right?

### ⭐ セクション 19

That's just supply and demand. That's fear of the investors. There's thousands of different factors that determine the price. So, if we're talking about about the bubble, we need to clarify, are we talking about the bubble in terms of AI or in terms of the markets? Because AI is clearly improving.

### 📝 セクション 20

Like, we're seeing every month some amazing releases. Literally, there's too much content to make. Like we're uploading every other day almost and it's like we cannot even catch up. Even when you spend 10 hours per day on AI, researching, testing all the latest stuff, you cannot keep up. So AI is improving faster than ever.

### 💡 セクション 21

But stock market, yeah, sure, there could be a stock market crash. I don't know where to go. >> Just go through that tunnel. Follow the main road. We're kind of freestyling this.

### 🔧 セクション 22

>> Yeah, we're freestyling. >> We're in the fjords. >> So So why are we in the fs? >> Yeah. So, we're in the fjords of Norway because we're working on something big.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Now, unfortunately, I cannot release too much right now. I cannot reveal too much, but yeah, it's probably going to be the biggest thing I've ever built. And um yeah, it's going to be combining three years of knowledge in AI into a single thing. Again, I don't want to spoil it too much because that's the purpose of this trip to get fresh ideas to lock in, you know, remove myself from all the distractions of the day-to-day life. We rented a Airbnb in the middle of the FJS 3 hours away from Bergen and yeah so it's going to be coming soon so stay stay tuned.

### 💭 セクション 24

>> Okay. But going back to like the topic of governments do you think it's the last decade before governments start introducing humanoid robots and police? >> Yeah. I think the concept of the last decade is something people don't really understand. You know 2025 to 2035.

### 📌 セクション 25

This really should be the called the last decade. And that's because, you know, if you see some of the crazy stuff that's going in Europe, for example, where in the UK they just arrest you for social media posts, you can still kind of appeal to emotion to the human police officer. Right now, imagine once the police officers are humanoid robots, right? Imagine once it's centralized hi controlled by a large government or a big tech company, then we're going to be truly screwed. So I think we really have the last decade, the last 10 years where we can make a change where we can pressure these companies into making these models rest less restricted into making sure that open source wins.

### ✅ セクション 26

AGI really needs to be open source guys because if it's not then imagine like Sam ultimate deciding when you have access to AG or not right now if you lost access to Chad GBT you would survive right you there's it's not big no big deal but imagine once it's 10 times better 100 times better like even today if you were completely bankless without electricity and without internet in today's world you couldn't compete like you just simply cannot compete in this world once Asia is achieved that's going to next level of magnitude and orders of magnitude more important than this. So it needs to be able to run locally. It needs to be open source. It cannot be controlled by a centralized entity. No matter if that's a government, no matter if that's a company.

### 📚 セクション 27

So if I were you, I would look into local models. I would install Oola Lama, install LM Studio, learn how to run GPTOSS locally, learn how to run Mistrol or Quen. Doesn't matter. just study local models, study fine tuning, and uh make sure that you're improving. >> But what what do you think of uh retards that hate on Elon for having too much money?

### 🔖 セクション 28

>> Yeah, this is a big problem. Like honestly, if you look back in the history, you know, ancient Greece or even Roman Empire, the type of people that were admired were the risktakers, right? Odysius, Prometheus, like the great men of history. Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Hannibal. This needs to be brought back.

### 🎨 セクション 29

We need to make sure exceptionalism is encouraged. Right? The people who hate on Elon, they're mostly complete users. They're like they're use they're don't produce anything for society. This is a like you have to realize Elon is taking us to Mars, right?

### 🚀 セクション 30

Most people can't even say anything close to that. No matter if it's a you know an entrepreneur, a scientist, inventor, researcher like Isaac Newton, Carl Gaus, whoever it is, someone who tries to invent something new. These people need to be promoted. They need to be encouraged. They cannot be hindered by society.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Right now, society tries to just tax great men as much as possible. Society tries to extract as much money from them. Put regulations on them, limitations on them, peer pressure. Like, why should Elon Musk give away half of his fortune? Just let him cook, guys.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Let him cook. Let him take us to Mars. Let him develop Grog. Let him create Murink. Let him create Solar City.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Boring company, Tesla. Self-driving. How many lives will be saved by self-driving? Listen, I enjoy fast cars. I love gasoline and the internal combustion engine, right?

### 📋 セクション 34

But Tesla is going to save millions of lives. It's going to save like so many people's lives. And you cannot really put price on that. I I don't want to sound like a hippie, but like anybody who lost a dear person in an accident, right? Doesn't matter if it it's your friend or family member, you would probably give all your money to have that person back alive.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And this is what self-driving will do. It will not be like twice as safe. It will reduce the death count by probably 100x. So that is priceless. And that's just one thing Elon is doing.

### 📝 セクション 36

So no matter who it is, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Isaac Newton, these people need to be led, they need to be able to cook, right? We cannot limit them. We cannot. >> But how do you determine like who we give this much power to? Like would you trust the same amount of level of power with Sam Alman?

### 💡 セクション 37

>> Sure. I mean just anybody who's trying to do something, you know, like Brian Johnson as well. No matter what you think of Brian Johnson, he's trying to do great things. He's experimenting on himself to see if it's possible to live forever. And you might think it's foolish, but you have to admire that he's investing millions of his own money, open sourcing everything, releasing all the findings and testing all the drugs and all the experiments and cures on himself to see what works and shares it with the public.

### 🔧 セクション 38

People who are doing crazy stuff, right? people who are trying to test new ideas, invent new technology, solve mathematical problems. Like these people just need to be encouraged, not like the safe job. It it starts with the educational educational system obviously, right? A kid is in school and it's like just take the easy path like, you know, don't stick out too much, you know, don't do anything crazy.

### 🎯 セクション 39

That's a huge problem. We need to encourage people to do crazy stuff. When someone builds a company that fails, I'm not laughing, you know, like there's plenty of AI startups like overhyped solutions. You might say like okay some of them were clearly in retrospect overhyped or like raised too many money by investors whatever but like you have to admire people who try stuff right like most if most of them fail that's fine but the problem that we're facing right now where if you look at the last 80 years and if you've seen the New York vlog you would have seen this progress is only in technology right society it hasn't really progressed in fact it regressed like if you look at these videos it's like time travel train and it's not time travel into the future It's time travel 100 years ago in the UK to see like a luxury train what it looked like and that's depressing. If you see a time travel video and it's into the past and not into the future that is very very depressing.

### 💭 セクション 40

So we need to make sure that the future is improving you know and that goes on all directions not just AI not just software technology cures healthcare math science physics chemistry whatever it is like I encourage all of it. Yeah, because we kind of take it for a given that everything is just going to naturally improve, but >> yeah, that's a fallacy. >> Clearly not the case for the continent that we're in right now. >> That's well, yeah, especially in Europe because um you know, people in Europe think it's still the greatest continent in the world, but like if you look at Asia, if you look at the Middle East, a lot of countries are improving way faster and Europe is falling behind. I mean, it's not an exaggeration, but it goes all around the world.

### 📌 セクション 41

A lot of people take progress for granted like internet phones. They just think like some oh it just happens you know like oh new iPhone comes out every year. It's like no new iPhone comes out because there's tens of thousands of high IQ engineers at Apple who make it happen you know who each year reinvent the phone make it better. I mean sure usually it's like slightly improved but all these improvements are hard you know better camera better display longer battery life. And this is not even like going zero to one.

### ✅ セクション 42

This is just like improving an existing product. Going zero to one, inventing that something doesn't exist is that much harder. And yeah, no matter who it is, like there's these guys from Extropic who are the who are inventing the new type of chip, a thermodyam thermodynamical computing unit. And who knows if it's going to work or if it's not going to work, but either way, it's something new and I support it, you know, no matter what it is. Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 43

By the way, if you are watching this about 15 minutes into the video, I think you should guys subscribe. >> Yeah. >> For more insights like this. >> Yeah. If you want more of these like raw videos where I just talk about AI related topics.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Left or right? >> Left. Left. Left. >> Then make sure to subscribe.

### 🎨 セクション 45

You know, hit the subscribe button. Takes two seconds and it helps out a lot. >> Yeah. We're going through the fjords right now. >> Yeah, Norway is beautiful.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Low key. probably top five countries. I would say top five low key >> and we're making a vlog out of the Norway trips. >> Yeah. Make sure to subscribe to see the vlog because this is only the beginning.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Literally, we're just getting started over here. >> So, what do you think of the current job market cuz it's we're in a kind of a weird situation right now with >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, unemployment is super high even for graduates from great universities, right? Like Harvard, MIT.

### 🌟 セクション 48

The thing is, I don't really feel bad for them because I'm hiring for multiple roles at our companies and we're still struggling to find candidates. And it's not because of specialized knowledge, you know, like someone not knowing some programming language or some editing software. It's all because of the fundamentals. People lack the fundamentals. They don't know when to show up on time.

### 🎬 セクション 49

They don't One guy didn't even have a t-shirt on the interview, guys. It's crazy. People are completely lazy. People don't know like all it takes is be consistent, show up on time, be reliable, be proactive and learn fast. You give me someone like that and I'm hiring that person on the spot because you can take that person and teach him anything >> especially in this field.

### 📋 セクション 50

>> Absolutely. Yeah. In AI there is nobody with 10 years of experience, right? In language models because they were released like what first language model is GPT2 I guess. I mean GPT1 is more experiment.

### ⭐ セクション 51

I guess the transformer was the breakthrough 2017. But still like LLMs only since release of JBD have become super powerful. So nobody has like 10 years of experience, right? So you need people who are fast learners and who give a You need to hire people who give a Not only about the field, which obviously we're in AI, but in general about your company and about the mission. So yeah, I don't know.

### 📝 セクション 52

The job market is very strange because on one hand lots of unemployment, lots of uncertainty. On the other hand, I feel like if you're just a bit proactive, if you just, you know, learn, you can, guys, if you're applying to a company, just do a single deep research about the company and about the founder before you go on the interview and you'll already be ahead of 90% of the candidates. Like, it's it's so easy to stand out if you just try >> that way. All right. >> That way.

### 💡 セクション 53

Yeah. And but I mean especially in the job market as well it's like most jobs are getting replaced and you noticed that recently with notebookm >> but we noticed that also yesterday with nano banana pro the fact that we don't need thumbnail designers. You already mentioned coding. There's there's >> it's it's actually it's not that everyone's getting replaced. It's like who's not getting replaced you know?

### 🔧 セクション 54

Yeah. >> How do you determine that? >> Well I mean again you have to think from first principles what the current AI models are good at and what they're bad at. Like for example, they're really bad at judgment, right? And decision- making.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So I think like anybody who's a entrepreneur, executive, seuite, like people who have to make decisions, that's a AI is bad at that. So those jobs are safer than others. But still like nobody's truly safe and thumbnail designers like something that it's funny because you know in the past people thought that the creative roles would be safe, you know. Yeah. But that's clearly not the case because Nano Banana Pro can design multiple thumbnail variations in like a few minutes and it's better than most thumbnail designers, right?

### 💭 セクション 56

Like we both both worked with thumbnail designers. They are slow, they're not creative, they're overpricing. Nano Banana is just like it's cheap, it's fast, it's unlimited, and that's just one role. So yeah, jobs are getting replaced today. And if you think your job is safe, you probably haven't thought about the deep enough, right?

### 📌 セクション 57

And um yeah, it's all about staying adaptable. It's all about trying to look into the future. And look, it's uncomfortable for everybody. Like, you know, the realization that Nana Banana will like, it's funny because we made a video on Nano Banana. And one of the top comments is like, I'm not watching this.

### ✅ セクション 58

I'm just going to paste the transcript into Nano Banana. And >> that was about no problem. >> Yeah, that was about Oh, that was about Noam. Okay. Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 59

But the point is the same, right? like there was a like what 39minute video and someone commented that like he's not going to he doesn't have the time to watch it and he just took the transcript and pasted it into notebook LM and listen like summarized it in 5 minutes right so that obviously cost me money that cost me less views and it's a real cost right and you don't see it because these layoffs and you know these lack of opportunities are kind of hidden so yeah it's a hard question and I don't have all the answers like what type of businesses will work what types of role will be there you just have to think from first principles like staying adaptable whatever feels directionally correct right >> I mean the the first thing that comes to my mind with with this is that uh you know like if replacing jobs also is a big pro for businesses for example because they're saving a bunch of costs so the the money for them is or the money for other people is the implementation of AI into businesses you know and helping helping them automate these jobs whether it's for like a commission onetime payment monthly recurring fee whatever it is >> it'll create new jobs essentially, you know. >> I mean, yeah, every industrial revolution, every technological revolution creates so many new jobs and that's kind of hard to see in the moment. People only see the current stuff that's getting replaced, but yeah, there will be so many new jobs. Absolutely.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Like, you know, a prompt engineer like that was a complete joke 3 years ago, but now many companies are hiring prompt engineers. So, there's going to be many new jobs and maybe this is not the best example, but understanding the AI deeply, right? being at the cutting edge. That's why communities like New Society exist is for people who are serious. If you're on the cutting edge, you honestly are best positioned than everybody else.

### 🎨 セクション 61

No matter what what it is, AI video, AI image, AI coding, just pick a sub field of AI and master it. And again, think what is directionally correct. If you try two, three new AI tools per week, that obviously cannot be wrong. If you spend 30 minutes a day learning new concept that obviously cannot be wrong if you're adaptable. If you're trying to you know listen to podcasts of Andre Grapathi of other researchers Richard Sutton people at the cutting edge of AI then that's obviously correct.

### 🚀 セクション 62

There are some things that like you know are the right moves are the engine moves that no matter what happens will be correct. The one thing I don't like about all the AI hype is that the companies that try just try forcing AI uh because of the stock market bubble, I think it is, they've try force all these AI chatbots into their apps. >> Yeah. Yeah, for sure. >> Just just forcing it everywhere where it doesn't need to be.

### ⚡ セクション 63

And >> well, I mean, I think that's part of the discovery process. You know, it's a new technology, so nobody really knows how it's going to be used or where it's going to be used. But yeah, you're right. Most of the implementation is kind of lazy. you know just like a chatbot in the bottom right >> or like an N10 agent that you know does an if else statement you know something like that.

### 🌟 セクション 64

>> Yeah. >> So using like an AI agent rather than code. >> Yeah. But again like a lot of people learn about AI and then like reverse engineer into software you know like oh this could be just done with Python like this can be done in 10 Python lines with no AI in the middle. It's faster it's cheaper it's more reliable.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So yeah there's a lot of inefficiency. There's people who use AI agents to like do the job of is if statement of a switch statement or like to find a substring of like a URL, right? Like I've seen like some automations that like literally take a UT YouTube URL and paste it into an LLM into an AI agent to output uh the video ID. This is beyond the target because not only is it expensive, you know, API calls are much more expensive than pure code. Like running Python is basically free.

### 📋 セクション 66

Like you just need a VPS and that's like cost you $5 per month or you just run it locally. You know which each API call cost you money. And not only that, it's also way less reliable. Code is deterministic. You write some software and it runs the same every single time.

### ⭐ セクション 67

That's not the same with AI. You know, LLMs give you different answer every time. So not only is it slower, it's it's less consistent. It's more expensive. So there's many situations where people try to use AI where you should just use pure software.

### 📝 セクション 68

But I don't know, I feel like this is just part of evolution, you know, like it's the new exciting technology. A lot of people are going to try building apps with it. Most of them are going to be useless and it's just a learning process. We're going to discover what's what's good or what isn't. >> Yeah.

### 💡 セクション 69

>> Like not everything has to have product market fit, you know, like you have to realize the com bubble had like pets.com. It had um dozens of other businesses that today do not exist. But it also created Google, Amazon and lots of great companies. So yeah, every tech trend, every, you know, new technology, every new hype cycle creates a lot of useless products. But again, the future is not guaranteed.

### 🔧 セクション 70

So nobody knows what's going to work and what isn't going to work. So >> but it's crazy how most people aren't doing anything about like like when we mentioned this is could be the last decade before. >> Yeah. uh humanoid robots, humanoid robot police, >> even the people that are in the AI space absolutely sometimes don't know like the big big model drops and >> oh yeah man >> like very obvious >> there's there's so many layers to this right so but first obvious layer is that the person on the street right they don't even know that AI is changing the world maybe they try maybe on the free plan of course but they don't know how good it is right they don't know about reasoning models they don't know about nano banana nothing that's the level one it's just people who aren't paying attention to AI. But then it gets crazier.

### 🎯 セクション 71

There's plenty of people who are in the AI space, but they're in the AI space for the wrong reasons, right? So that could be just getting clients, making money, or it's the latest trendy thing. They're not in it for the technology. They're not in it because it's going to change the world. And you'll be surprised, you know, I was like multiple AI events with people doing hundreds of thousands of dollars per month and they're not locked in.

### 💭 セクション 72

They don't even understand what's happening because they again are in it for the wrong reasons. They don't know about the latest models. They don't know about the differences between Grog cloth GPD models, Gemini models. They don't know about the companies. They don't know about the strategy.

### 📌 セクション 73

They're not thinking deeply about the future, about what, you know, what jobs are going to be in the future, what business models, what implications, how societyy's going to look like, how governments are going to look like. They just don't care. So, you would be surprised how few people are on the cutting edge. It's actually much easier than you think to be on the cutting edge. And obviously, there's no clear definition of what the cutting edge is.

### ✅ セクション 74

But yeah, most people, even those, even those that watch this channel, you know, even those that watch AI videos daily, still aren't doing anything about it. I don't know, man. At a certain point, this is like the the saying, you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink. Like people understand that AI is going to change the world, but they still are in a job that they hate. They're still in an industry that's dying.

### 📚 セクション 75

Like guys, you have to wake up. You have to realize that it's either like doing a little bit of a pain. Everything's change is painful, right? Change is not comfortable. And I understand that I had to do it myself 3 years ago when I stopped doing gaming content.

### 🔖 セクション 76

See guys, when I was 20 years old, I was making Minecraft videos and that was very lucrative business. you know, it was just a lean operation. Profit margins were like over 90%, $20,000 a month purely from YouTube AdSense. And uh yeah, that's very good money for a 20-year-old in Czech Republic. But I completely stopped that and switched to AI.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Why? Because AI, I understood very quickly that AI is going to change the world. So, obviously, it was uncomfortable going from making 20K a month to like $600 a month, right? It's not fun. um taking a huge step back socially and financially.

### 🚀 セクション 78

But listen, now it was clearly worth it, you know. So you have to realize like no matter what change you want to make right now if you're in a field that isn't evolving right there's many industries that are kind of dead that are stale or if you're in a company where like even if you perform you have no opportunity to grow or like you're in a job that you hate whatever understand that whatever change you have to make right now it's going to be way less painful than when your job is actually replaced or when company does massive layoffs and you're fired you know so again future isn't guarant guaranteed and you have to realize that if you're if you understand that AI is going to change everything from industry to education system to societies to how classes of you know different social economic levels are structured everything is going to be changed reinvented if you understand that and you're not doing anything about it you need to take a deep look in the mirror what I would recommend you to do let's get practical okay take a like a mini thing week book a trip into the mountains three or four days no work, no busy work, no emails, no meetings. And just walk around nature and think, is your job safe? Are you in the right industry? Like what are you missing?

### ⚡ セクション 79

You know, what are you not paying attention to? What hard decisions you have to make that you haven't made? And this is one of the best things you can do. You know, do this once a year, twice a year, like a mini thing week, and really ask yourself the big questions. And if if there's a hard decision that you knew you know you have to make sooner or later then I would encourage you to do it sooner because if you do it later it's going to be very very painful.

### 🌟 セクション 80

>> So what do you think is the 8020 that someone needs to learn? Is it like mathematics, Python, how AI actually works, the services you can do with it, the apps you can use with with it. What's what's the most important thing someone should learn first? How it works? >> Yeah, I mean there's so many 8020 things I would do.

### 🎬 セクション 81

First of all, getting just a paid version of ChBT, right? Like the basics. Like pay $20 a month for CHBT or Cursor or Claw. Just one of these tools or Perplexity. Just try it out, you know?

### 📋 セクション 82

Give it a shot. Uh test it out. And not the free models. Like the free models, obviously, they're improving, but like they're nowhere near as good as GBD 5.0 Pro or Gemini 3.0 Pro. These paid models are amazing.

### ⭐ セクション 83

The the the difference is huge. So that's first thing, right? Start paying for at least one AI tool. Second thing is just create a habit of trying one new AI software every week at least like honestly probably two tools every >> if you can't even like let's say you're completely broke you have no money you could even just watch videos about that too. Yeah, I mean there's plenty of softwares that have free plans, right?

### 📝 セクション 84

I think all of the major AI tools have free plans. So even if you just download these and try these out, like what matters is being proactive really. Like it's not nothing crazy. Like you don't have to be a professional back-end developer to benefit from this. It's it's more about just curiosity.

### 💡 セクション 85

You know, if you hear about new AI tool, just try it, install it, download it, and see if it's good or not. See if it works for your use case, for your own needs. If you hear about some term, right, what is fast API? What is SSH? What is cron?

### 🔧 セクション 86

Look into it, you know, do a deep research, find out more about it, learn about it. Things have never been so easy, so accessible. So that's how I would start. And really, it's like for everybody, the use cases are going to be different. You know, if you're someone who's like a writer, then maybe AI can help you brainstorm topics, you know, how to write your next novel, next fiction book.

### 🎯 セクション 87

If you're a graphic designer, try Nano Banana Pro, try Cling, try Hick AI. There's so many great tools. If you're a developer, cursor, codex, cloud code, you know, Droid, there's just so many tools like it's hard to say for every person. You need to you need to learn for yourself and you need to try stuff. And again, even on YouTube, there's so many things like even we like the amount of things we cover on our channel.

### 💭 セクション 88

I don't think there's a single person who watched all the videos. So yeah, just find out, test stuff out, keep learning. It's the basics. It's the basics really. Like the 8020 is the fundamentals.

### 📌 セクション 89

If you're curious, if you're hardworking, see like if you have a shitty job 9 to5, you cannot stop after you get home. This is one of the biggest mistakes, right? Well, keep going. >> Yeah, keep going. Keep going.

### ✅ セクション 90

>> Yeah. So, it's one of the biggest mistakes people make. It's like, do you think that's the time to relax? That's not the time to relax, guys. Like, when you get home, that is the time to lock in, you know?

### 📚 セクション 91

That's the time to start a new business, to build your own app, to start a website, to learn how to code anything. Like if you put in 20 hours into Python, you will have enough knowledge to do everything with AI tools, right? Because the AI tools, they remember all the syntax. And if you know what questions to ask, they can guide you in the right path. But if you have so much ignorance that that you don't even know like what if else statement means or the difference between an integer and a string, it's going to be tough.

### 🔖 セクション 92

You know, if you just learn the basics, you can move way faster and you can leverage the AI so much more. So no matter what it is, coding, learning, visual arts, graphic design, AI can be used. There's AI tools for everything. So it's just curiosity, work ethic, productivity, just put in more effort. It's all about the details.

### 🎨 セクション 93

>> Yeah. Attention to details. >> Yeah. Attention to the details. Like if you think about it, this is what separates mediocre and great people.

### 🚀 セクション 94

You know, Steve Jobs, like Steve Jobs is known for design, right? Mac like a MacBook, Macintosh, >> and not even just the outside, but even I seen an interview before it was like the interior components that no one ever sees. They're all well organized and designed. >> Yes. Beautiful >> inside and out.

### ⚡ セクション 95

>> Yeah. It's it's going back to hire people who give a It's like attention to the detail like for example, you know, Kobe when he was doing u three-point shooters, like you know, the way you stand, like the way you tie your shoes, everything matters, right? In basketball, everything matters in software. Like if you're developing software, your setup, right? like your IDE, you should know your IDE, your keyboard shortcuts.

### 🌟 セクション 96

You should know like the differences between the cloud hosted solutions, self-hosting, doesn't matter. In graphic design, you should know different softwares, you know, vector raster graphics. Like there's so many different things. It's all about the attention to details. Elon Musk building rockets, right?

### 🎬 セクション 97

There's so many things where he's just so many stories where he walked out the factory is like, do we need this bolt? What is this bolt even doing? And was like, oh yeah, the other department gave it for noise cancelling. Then they call up he call up the noise cancelling people like they don't even know why it's there. It's all about the attention to the detail, right?

### 📋 セクション 98

Same with John D. Rockefeller making sure that his all refineries are as efficient as possible. He was personally reviewing the books, doing the accounting as a multi-millionaire, checking all the payments, making sure he's not getting screwed, right? Same with Henry Ford doing the assembly line. It's all about the attention to the detail.

### ⭐ セクション 99

Whatever you're doing, you need to do it well and you need to care about the smallest things. You cannot be sloppy, right? And this creates opportunities because if you pay attention to the smallest of details, you're going to notice things that other people miss and that's how you access the secrets. That's how you see the opportunities where other people are missing it and you're like, "Oh this is going to be a huge industry or like there's an opportunity for new product. That's how you get an advantage.

### 📝 セクション 100

Attention to the detail >> and then this will also start to build momentum win after win." >> Yeah, momentum is like a universal law. People think that when you win you you can celebrate. I almost never celebrate. And the reason for that is not because like there there is no like deep reason. It's just like when you win there's an opportunity to do another win, right?

### 💡 セクション 101

When you do a difficult thing, you you I guarantee you all of all of you can relate from this from experience, right? Maybe there's like a difficult call you need to do or you need to fire a person or there's something difficult you need to do. Once you do it, you know, it feels like It's terrible in the moment, but in the same day, it's way easier to do other difficult stuff. And that's purely momentum, right? things compound.

### 🔧 セクション 102

And this is the same with having a win. If you have a win and you instant celebrate, like there's many people who just go to the club every week, people who just party all the time for no reason. And even if you have a reason, is it big enough of a reason to celebrate because most of the time it's not really. There's actually a great documentary about Notch, Marcus Person, the creator of Minecraft, who it was like 2011, 2012 after he went from like being a, you know, solo software indie developer to being like a multi-millionaire basically in these two years, you know, as the game took off and it was like I think it was New Year's from 2011 to 2012 and that was like the first moment where he could take a breath and like wow so much has happened and that's you know when he realized like wow I've built something eight if he was celebrating after like making his first thousand dollars and hitting up the club and just like you know inviting all his friends is like he wouldn't have built a multi-billion dollar company and that's the same in everything if you like you have to realize you can just keep on winning you know if you get a promotion you can follow follow that up by getting a bench PR you can follow that up by getting a new hotter girlfriend like you can keep on winning guys you know there's no limit to how much you can win this is something people don't understand they think like you win and you celebrate and that's you know the win for the month, that's the win for the year. No, each win unlocks new possibilities.

### 🎯 セクション 103

You know, action produces new information and new information you can see new possibilities. So when you win, look for the next possible win. Do not pause and do not stop celebrating and do not be happy like endlessly, you know, satisfied there. I think Michael Dell has a great saying it's like be happy always happy but never satisfied. I think that's the saying, right?

### 💭 セクション 104

Always happy but never satisfied. Like obviously you shouldn't be like pessimistic person. You should be happy in your day-to-day, but you shouldn't be satisfied with your situation, right? If you're staying in a nice four-star hotel, you have to think about what's the fivestar look like. If you're flying business class, you have to worry like this happened to me recently when we were flying to New York.

### 📌 セクション 105

You know, it was there the Abu Dhabi airport has amazing business lounge. But guys, that made me wonder what is the first class lounge like, you know, and I don't want to be like ungrateful like obviously flying business is a is a blessing and it's still amazing. It's still a huge upgrade from economy, but man, I was thinking like if the business lounge is this good, what does the first class look like? And again, if you're listening to this and you're thinking, "Oh, I'm materialistic." You're just like, think about this too narrowly. This is nothing to do with materialism.

### ✅ セクション 106

You can apply this to running a marathon or to health or, you know, relationships, whatever. It's about avoiding the seven out of 10. This is a lot of people stop at seven out of 10 and that's why they never achieve greatness. You have to keep pushing. You have to worry about like good but not great.

### 📚 セクション 107

That's the thing. Good but not great. You cannot be satisfied with good results. You have to push for the great results, right? And even if you like despise materialism and you know you don't want nice things.

### 🔖 セクション 108

For example, like I don't really care about nice clothes. You know, all of my clothes are pretty cheap. Like if someone stole my suitcase, I don't care. If someone stole my MacBook, I'm coming for you. But anyways, uh you know, doesn't matter.

### 🎨 セクション 109

Like I don't care about fancy clothes or watches or like that. But I do appreciate flying business class. Like you have to find out for yourself like what it is. And even if that's like providing for their family, you know, if you buy them a nice trip, imagine if you can take them on something else, right? A lot of people cannot even take their family on a nice vacation.

### 🚀 セクション 110

And that's something that like maybe is it's not buying things for you. It could be buying things for your wife or for your kids or for others, you know, having them enjoy life, whatever. But it's about like not being satisfied with decent stuff and always pushing for the next level. And now is also the best time to actually build a billion dollar startup, oneman team. Maybe it's not possible yet, but >> yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Well, it's the best time to do anything really. You know, like we talked about a lot of dangers and like people getting replaced, companies getting out competed by, you know, Sam Oldman and just these big players, but also it's the it's like the most like varied time in history. That's the way to put it, you know, cuz like there's so much upside and there's so much downside. There's so much risk, but there's so much reward. It's kind of hard to describe and had to hard to wrap your head around, but really there's more opportunity opportunity than ever before.

### 🌟 セクション 112

If you want to start a business, it has never been easier, right? You can literally go to Stripe Atlas and create a new LLC in like one day. 10 years ago, creating LLC was a whole process, right? You know, back in ' 82, I remember when we were starting our first business. I'm just trolling.

### 🎬 セクション 113

But listen, anything you want to build, it has never been easier. You can literally start a software company without knowing how to code. Think about how crazy that is. That was not possible even three years ago, even two years ago. So yeah, learning a new language, you can use Grock, you can use Chad GPT voice, you can use Gemini, all of these amazing tools to learn a new language faster than ever before.

### 📋 セクション 114

So literally anything you want to do, it is now possible. If you're not doing it, you're probably just full of excuses, to be fair. >> Yeah. And with all that being said, if you did make it to the end and you're not in the new society, I do strongly suggest you join. Yeah, the new society has actually produced some amazing projects.

### ⭐ セクション 115

People don't realize, for example, Agent Zero, right? This is one of the fastest growing open source projects in all of AI. >> Over like what 13,000 starts on GitHub. It's pretty crazy. So, shout out to Yan and Agent Zero team.

### 📝 セクション 116

Everybody, there's a lot of open source contributors as well, but honestly, it's mainly Yan. >> Someone was asking about that in the comments actually. >> Yeah, someone was asking about that in >> What are some use cases of it, would you say? >> Yeah, there's a lot of use cases. I mean, look, it's the most powerful local agent >> and the the finding the Bitcoin last bitcoin wallet is crazy.

### 💡 セクション 117

People don't realize like Yan was Ethereum actually, but okay. Yan used Agent Zero to recover $4,000 of blocked Ethereum because someone made a transaction to a lost wallet. Like it was like a dead wallet, right? And he used Agent Zero to use like open source uh jailbreaking techniques and like brute forcing and I don't know the exact details, but basically Agent Zero managed to recover $4,000 in lost Ethereum. And that's just one of many use cases.

### 🔧 セクション 118

So yeah uh by the way agent zero was developed in new society right it was tested there it was named there the first 100 users were all in new society so yeah like look it's the place where where the future happens like if you're not in the new society you're honestly falling behind so make sure to join it's going to be the first link below the video >> and there's also a lot of other people apart from just inside of it there's many >> there's hundreds of people at the cutting edge of AI I mean we met some amazing guys in New York Sean and Alex and Um, listen, we're we're working on something better because something bigger because I was recently in Dubai and I met one new society member named Jakob. Shout out to Yakub. And we were talking about it and he was saying that like he wants something that is more high level, something that's more like on the cutting edge, more more like implementation, more uh step by step. And yeah, again I I cannot reveal too much, but this is going to be one of the biggest things I've seen you've guys seen in the AI space and um I think we we're going to announce it in the next one or two weeks. >> So stay tuned for that.

### 🎯 セクション 119

>> It's the reason we're locking ourselves up in Norway. >> Yes. The reason >> disconnected for from society. >> Yeah. Ultimately, that is the reason why we're in Norway, why we're driving in the snowing fjords instead of being, you know, chilling in Dubai is because we need to finish this project.

### 💭 セクション 120

And, you know, I just need to remove myself from all distractions and change the environment to get fresh ideas, fresh thoughts, and to really make this product as good as possible because look, I could if I was optimizing for income, I would never be an AI. I could just scale my Minecraft channel to hundreds of thousands of dollars because it was very very possible. There was competitors. They're making the same fact videos just like a list of 20 facts as me making like $100,000 $200,000 per month pure profit zero overheads very elegant business model. But uh again you shouldn't switch to AI to make money.

### 📌 セクション 121

Obviously all of us want to make money and that is important but AI is going to change the world and soon enough you know in 20 years money might be a thing of the past especially fiat currency as it's being printed trillions and trillions of dollars it's really worthless you know like bitcoin is actually pro tip guys bitcoin is on sale right now so if you're not investing into bitcoin I would consider it you know obviously do it at your own risk study uh study it yourself I think I put in like well honestly I don't have any bitcoin because I lost it in a boating accident if you know what I But uh yeah, you should put in like 100 hours of research before you even consider investing into any asset. So so many people are like, "Oh, you know, let's just diversify into companies." Guys, that's a strategy. If you buy 10 different companies, you don't even know what you're buying. If you don't put 200 hours of research into an asset, you don't understand that asset. Whether it's real estate, whether it's a stock, whether it's a cryptocurrency, you have no clue what you're doing.

### ✅ セクション 122

So just, you know, learn how to invest. Put in the due diligence, no matter what it is. But yeah, AI is u AI is going to change everything. So if you only think about money, you're limiting yourself. And I would encourage you to think outside of the box.

### 📚 セクション 123

Think of unique ideas. And if you have something you want to build, go ahead and build it because it's never been more possible.
