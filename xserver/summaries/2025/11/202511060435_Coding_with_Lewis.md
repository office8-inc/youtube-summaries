## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Something that is plaguing the world of developers right now is vibe coding PR slop since GitHub contributions and projects worked on is a big flex for [music] job searching and just all around flexing developers are contributing at the speed of light an open source project which sounds good right but um but how are you doing that coding agents obviously and sadly it's really easy to do this in fact you can do this straight on GitHub like you don't even have to open it up in your code editor or anything. And this means that human reviewers are a bottleneck. Sam Saffron puts these into two buckets. The prototype, which these coding agents do really well, is when you kind of just vibe code everything [music] and just hope for the best. Uh, and then you have the ready to review, which is like a traditional pull request in the sense that we're all used to.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, this would be something in scope of the project that has had time to review with a human accountable at the end of the day. But we shouldn't just ban AI generated code like that just isn't effective here. There's a lot of benefits to using AI coding agents. Sam also said that realistically we as developers have to label our code correctly and set strict rules on the repository on what is and isn't acceptable. But still it's going to be tough.
