## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Yesterday, Google released their new Nano Banana Pro. And I thought today we can build five different apps that I think is like milliondoll ideas that maybe some of you should follow. So, we're going to start with the first one. This is going to be the random celebrity selfie app. And you can see we have five more.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, I'm going to leave one by one here until we have all five. But, let's start with the celebrity selfie app. and I thought we can use Gemini 3 to actually help us build the app in combinations with uh yeah cloud code. So let's just get started. Uh I'm going to speed through this a bit.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So I'm not going to do every single detail, but I want to focus on kind of the end product, right? So yeah, let's hop into the first one and create a selfie uh app. Okay, so the way we're going to do this is I'm going to go to the Google AI studio. I'm going to use the build feature here, right? So, I'm going click on build here.

### 📝 詳細説明

And we need some context because we want to use the yeah the the Gemini uh API. Uh but I want to use this through FAL AI. So, I'm going to select the Nano Banana Pro and we're going to focus mostly I think on the edit model because on an app you kind of want someone to upload an image. But we'll see. Maybe we do something else.

### 💡 実例・デモ

But let's see. So, I want to do this. So, I need some context. So, I just went to the API here. I copied everything we need to know about this API.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I put it into a nano2.txt file in my docs here. And I have my API key from file down here. So this is basically all the context we're going to feed to the build feature here in Google AI Studio. So I'm just going to put in Okay, let me close this. So I'm just going to put in this nano2.txt as context here.

### 🎯 応用例

And then I'm just going to try to describe my app. and let's see what we get back here. So, we will try to run this uh maybe locally. We'll see what we will do here. Maybe we'll just run it in the build uh uh preview here if it works.

### 💭 考察

Okay. So, I have the prompt here. So, this first time I'm going to kind of go through the prompt so you kind of know how I'm going to approach all of these apps we're going to generate today because I don't want to go into this much detail into every single app. But the first one now, let's see here now. So, I'm going to run with the prompt.

### 📌 まとめ

I want an app that generates a selfie with a random celebrity. The user uploads a picture of themsel and select from a menu if the celebrity should be a male or a female. Then the app should send uh a prompt to the Fal Nano API Pro API to generate a perfect selfie with a random male uh/female celebrity. We want to set the aspect ratio to 916. Create a simple but stylish UI for the app.

### ✅ 結論

And I'm going to use the versel text stack. So that is all I'm going to give this. And let's just hit build. You can see we already have this context from the API. Uh I could mention so I want to mention uh let the user be able to paste in their API key in the UI aka bring their own API key.

### 📚 追加情報

Hide this with stars. So uh I think this could make it a bit easier. So now we're just going to run this and hopefully uh Gemini is now going to create this app for us. We can try to run it in preview. If not, I'm going to move it over to cursor here and we can do some adjustments using cloud code.

### 🔖 補足

So, I'm just going to let this run now and I will take you back when we have hopefully a working app. Okay. So, uh after going a bit back and forward, I think we have something that is working here. So, this is our uh celeb selfie app. Okay.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, we need to enter our fal key. So, let me quickly grab that. Okay. So, let's paste that in. And now I'm just going to select an image uh I need to upload.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, let me find an image of me here. Yeah, I'm just going to take this one. Okay. And I want a celebrity to be female. And I'm just going to click generate selfie.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So hopefully now I get like a selfie back. Uh like a selfie, like an image back with a random female celebrity. So let's try this. And let's try the male version. Uh also to see if that works.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay. Uh yeah, we got something here. That is Jennifer. What is she called again? Jennifer.

### 🎬 セクション 17

I can't remember her last name. So, she is a pretty famous uh I look a bit strange, but uh let's do it one more time. So, I'm going to do one more female and let's do one more one male at the end. So, that is working perfect. That was super easy to set up.

### 📋 セクション 18

And if I think if I did this like um like an iOS app, I think people would find this funny to use. So, yeah, let's do one more and then try the mail. So, it's crazy to think about how easy it is to create stuff like this now when we have like Gemini 3 and we have the Nano Banana. So, who is this? This is Scarlett Johansson, right?

### ⭐ セクション 19

It looks a bit strange, but uh it's pretty cool. Okay. And I can download this. This is something I also added. So, let's do a mail.

### 📝 セクション 20

Okay. Okay. So, we have the mail. So, this is Canal Reefs, right? From Matrix Neo.

### 💡 セクション 21

So again, pretty cool. Pretty cool. And I can download this. And yeah, I think that's a success, right? And that was super easy.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And I think this is a pretty fun idea. So let's just move on to the next one. So for the next uh app I wanted to do that's like a million dollar idea, I think is uh can I can I move this? It's going to be the multi-image input branding team. So just to explain this quickly.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So my idea was that you can take uh let's say you take two I will show you I will show you an app. I will show you in the app instead I think. Okay. So this app we had to move away from Gemini to over to cloud code because I had some issues I couldn't figure out. I don't know why but uh we fixed it with cloud code.

### 💭 セクション 24

We just had to switch the client. So that was a bit strange. But let's see now. So I'm going to do mpm rundev and let's see if we can actually get this app working. So this is the app.

### 📌 セクション 25

is called the brand genius AI app. And what you can do here is that we need to upload like two uh reference color images. So I want color one is going to be black. Second color is going to be yeah yellow or like yeah um green. The style is going to be like uh I love the game mega bonk.

### ✅ セクション 26

So we're going to use that. And the brand object is going to be Peppa. And I'm just going to call the I'm just gonna call the brand name Mega Bonk Bonk. Okay. Okay.

### 📚 セクション 27

So, I just updated the brand name. So, it's going to be Meabunk Security Ltd. That is our company. So, now I'm just going to click generate identity. And hopefully now we're going to take all these images and send them like a multiple.

### 🔖 セクション 28

and Gemini or not Gemini, Nano Pro Banana Pro is going to try to combine all of this into a logo design, a brand mood board, uh an infographic, and a homepage draft. So, basically, we could have other assets here, but this is something I wanted to test out. So, I've seen some examples of this. Okay, so this is working perfect. So, that here is our homepage draft.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, a Gemini or Nana Banana seems very good at actually doing this. So let's download this and let's take a look here. So this is the first one. This is our homepage. Yeah, you can see we have the meabunk, we have the uh meabunk security ltd, we have the login page.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Here is okay. Why choose us? Okay, so that was just Lauram Ipsum, but uh other than that, pretty cool. Okay, so that was the first asset. And here we got the logo design.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Let's check that out. Mega Bonk security. Maybe a bit boring, but it is working. Uh, let's check out the infographic. What is that?

### 🌟 セクション 32

Uh, okay. So, here is Mega Bunk Security. Fortifying your digital frontier. 100% integrity, innovation, reliability, founded in 2010. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 33

### 📋 セクション 34

We have the Peppa frog. We have some kind of I don't know what that is. Some kind of security suit. This was the best one. High fashion protection.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Okay, pretty fun. And some colors and some textures. And I like this part. That was pretty cool. So, I guess you can play around with this and have a lot of fun.

### 📝 セクション 36

So, I think this idea is pretty cool and doesn't have to be exactly uh what you're going to end up with, but this could give you some very cool ideas if you are into this creative space. So, I think this app idea is very good too. So, let's move on to the next one. Let me show you that is going to be the from 2D to 3D image app. Okay, so we can take out an image in and we can try to turn it into a 3D app.

### 💡 セクション 37

So, let me show you that one. Okay. So, this app was uh generated in the Gemini build feature. So, I just download it here and I'm going to run it local. So, like I said, the idea here is that we upload like a 2D image and we can get it from we can rotate it to get it into different angles.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So, let me show you how this works. So, let me just upload an image we can try out here. So, let's try this Taylor Swift image here. Okay. So, let's just select uh let's do 4x3.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And I'm just going to click turn into 3D. And now we're going to get uh three more images. So we're going to get it from a left view, I guess, and a right view and from behind or back view. So let's see how well this turned out. We we're going to try a couple of different images here.

### 💭 セクション 40

So I'm just going to take you back when we kind of have yeah everything here uh loaded so we can try to spin around here. Okay. So we have it now. So you can see this was the original input image. So if we go right now, you can see that is not too good, but it is moving a bit.

### 📌 セクション 41

And now we can go from the left side and we can do from the back. I think that's pretty cool, right? Still looks very good even though we kind of have the different angle from the back here. This is from the right and this is the image and this is this was the image and this is from the left. Okay, I guess that's fine because this was already kind of from the left.

### ✅ セクション 42

We should maybe have from the front here, I guess. But still, I It's pretty impressive, right? So, that was one image. Let's try Let's try a new one. Let's do a different image.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, I have a cat here, I think. This one. So, let's do this one. I want to do 916. And let's turn this into 3D.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So, again, we want to do right, back, and left. Right. And I think I want to do one more after this just to see the difference. Okay, so that was pretty quick. So here is the image we started with.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Now let's try to go left. Yeah, that is a left and let's go back. Okay, and from the right. I guess the right angle is kind of missing. Uh but still okay, pretty fine.

### 🚀 セクション 46

I like the from the behind. We are struggling kind of to get the image from right. We get left and left, I think. Uh, but still pretty cool. Uh, let's try something else here.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Let's do one more. Uh, I don't have any like specific images. Uh, but let's see what happens if I do the mega bunk image. Uh, this is almost like a 916, I would guess, or like a 169. Let's see how that that this turned out.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So, this is like more like a Yeah. animated 3D drawing asset, I guess. Okay, so that was pretty fast. So, this is from the left, I guess. And this is from the back.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And again, we get the left two times, but still, look how little it only kind of moves the the character, right? You can see from here to left and from here to back, right? So, we do here, here, and here. That is pretty good. And you can see the background is not changing at all.

### 📋 セクション 50

Uh, it's just a bit of movement on the grass here, but still pretty good. And I think some 3D animators, movie stuff, people can kind of use this for something good. So, I thought this app also turned out pretty successful if you ask me. [snorts] Uh, but let's move on. Let's do uh our fourth app.

### ⭐ セクション 51

And this is going to be something I called a random video gen profile picture app. Okay. And this worked uh straight out of uh Okay. I didn't want to show you that. Okay.

### 🎯 セクション 55

I guess looking straight at the camera. So, let's see here now. Okay, so this was the first one. Okay, so I'm wearing a cap and I have this armor. Okay, so I'm not looking straight into the camera, but pretty cool in an uh Anyway, uh let's select a different one.

### 💭 セクション 56

So, let's do a platformer or let's do retrow. This should be more like pixel art, I think. Let's see how that turned out. But again, I could have worked more on the prompts here. Maybe we should have removed the background image.

### 📌 セクション 57

But it's so cool that we can do with so little effort, we can create something that is pretty cool to play around with. And now we are kind of combining Gemini 3 Pro. Uh it's so good at creating this small apps. Uh okay. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 58

Okay. I like this one. I'm going to download this. That that looks pretty cool. So this is me with my shirt.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So very cool. Again, super simple app, but the results are pretty amazing. So yeah, let's do the last one. So I want to show you. So this is the 10X booster app.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Uh I'm going to explain a bit more inside the app what this does. Uh while you wait for that, you can have a guess. So let's head over there. Okay. So, here is the Hyper Boost AI app.

### 📋 セクション 66

So, again, we can put in our key here, right? So, I'm just going to paste in my key. And what we can do here now is we can upload a source image and we can boost something. So, uh we can boost something two times, five times or 10 times. So, let me show you an example.

### ⭐ セクション 67

So, let's upload image of yeah, let's take our cat here. Uh we can select aspect ratio. So, let's just do 916. Okay, so this is going to be our source image. Ooh, that's a nice touch.

### 📝 セクション 68

And we can make the cat look more crazy. Something like that. Let's just put in crazy. We want to boo boost the crazy look. Let's just do crazy look.

### 💡 セクション 69

### 🔧 セクション 70

And yeah, for you this is going to go pretty fast. I'm just going to sit here and wait. Okay, so we have the results. So this was pretty cool, right? So we kind of go from this image to this.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Even more crazy and absolute 10 times crazy. Look at this image. Uh, okay. So that worked very good. Better than I expected to be honest.

### 💭 セクション 72

Uh, I need to try this on something else. So, let me just think of something I can try this with. I don't know what's going to happen if we do zoom out. I I don't know what's going to happen here, but let's try this. Let's do Aling Holland and let's do a zoom out 69 image.

### 📌 セクション 73

I haven't tried this with this app yet. So, yeah, I'm just going to put it like there. And for you, this is going to be pretty fast. I'm just going to again sit here and wait. Okay, this was pretty cool, right?

### ✅ セクション 74

So, we started with this original image, right? Uh, this was very bad, but it recognized that it was on the Etiad stadium, but the image was bad. But then we zoomed out this. So, now we are very far off the stadium and then we ended up far up in the sky here, right? Look at this.

### 📚 セクション 75

So, here we are far up in the sky. You can kind of see the stadium down here. So, even though it didn't do exactly what we was looking for, I was pretty impressed. Anyway, and I would say this app is super fun. Let's do one more thing.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Let me think of something that is uh I want to do like some remember those more Italian. Let's try those things. So, we have this meme image of Sam Alman here and let's try to do it more. Let's do it more Italian. Uh let's do 916.

### 🎨 セクション 77

I have no idea what's gonna happen here, but again, let's put it up here and see what happens. Okay, that was just insane, right? Look at this. So, I I would say here it did a very good job here. We can kind of see the nuances, right?

### 🚀 セクション 78

We have Sam here. Uh we have a bit more Italian. We have very much more Italian. And then we have 10 times more Italian. So here we kind of get into getting this cappuccino.

### ⚡ セクション 79

We get the typical outfit. We get the family pictures. We get the tomato sauce, the garlic, the big hair, the insane tan. And yeah, that was just very cool. I said this was the best success we had so far.

### 🌟 セクション 80

So I think that's a very good spot to end this on. And I got to say, I had so much fun with this uh with the a aentic capabilities we have with these new good APIs, these insane good image models. There's just so much you can do. And now we have Gemini Twitter to help help us put everything together and you can kind of combine this with cloud code to do some debugging. It's just so much fun and it's just so much fun things you can build.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Now, so this was just done in a couple of hours. I built five very fun app that I basically made today. Think of that like 10 years ago, 5 years ago, even 3 years ago. How hard that would be to build five apps in 3 hours with totally different capabilities based around one API and everything gets like a a UI we could push uh with the Versel stack. That is just insane, right?

### 📋 セクション 82

So, like I said many times before, this is just the beginning. So, everyone's got to be prepared for like a huge change in everything we do going forward, and this is just the beginning. So, yeah, brace yourself because this is going to be very fun. And thank you for tuning in today. Have a great uh weekend.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Hopefully, I'll see you again soon. And enjoy your day.
