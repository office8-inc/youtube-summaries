## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, I'm just going to show you the prompt I used. Uh, next is going to be to create a voice control of the drone. Okay. So, when I run a voice control.py now, hopefully we can connect to the drone. Perfect.

### 📋 背景・概要

And this should start hovering now. So, I'm going to try to film this. So, let's see. Okay, perfect. So, now we can start voice control.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, I can just press M here. Move 50 left. Okay, so that's working. move 150. Right.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, today we are doing uh a bit of a different thing. I have this crazy fly 2 plus 2.1 plus and yeah, I'm going to open up this. So, this is basically Yeah, all the other stuff we need, right? So, let me just open this. Yeah, I think I just pop this open here.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And basically in here we have everything we need to build this small swarm drone. Yeah, you can see it. We have the flow deck here. Here we have uh the radio controller and I'm going to put everything together. Do we have anything else here?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I don't think so. So, let's remove that. Okay. Uh let's open up the fly here. Right.

### 🎯 応用例

So, this is just a very small simple to learn uh swarm drone. I just got one now. So, you can see here and we're going to put everything together today. So, you can see there's a lot of different parts here. So, we're going to put everything together and then we're going to use um AI to actually help us with the code to get this flying.

### 💭 考察

Right. So, I'm just going to yeah start sorting out the the parts here and let's start putting this small swarm drone together. So, the first step I'm going to do is uh I'm just going to twist this wires here on the motor. Right. So, basically just make a twist here.

### 📌 まとめ

So yeah, they just hold up a bit better. And that is just going to be our first step. So I'm going to do this for all the motors, right? Okay. So that's it.

### ✅ 結論

So you can see we have all the motors and the wires twisted up. So now we can just start mounting this like this. Right. So that's the first one. So I'm just going to do the same with the three others.

### 📚 追加情報

Okay. So we got all the motors, right? Perfect. Set up. So now we can kind of just u start attaching our twisted wire.

### 🔖 補足

Okay. like this. So, I'm going to do that for all motors. Okay. So, that was done.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, let's do the next step. And that is going to be to slide the motor onto the body of the drone here. So, I'm just going to slide this in here while we attach the the connectors here on the body of the drone. Okay, perfect. So, that was done.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, you can see now we have the all the motors attached here. Perfect. And now we're just going to do the propellers on top of the Yeah. motors here. Right.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Okay. So, now I just attached some uh rubber uh plate here and we have some pins. And now I'm just going to attach the battery pack here. This small battery pack we have here. And that's it.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Right. So, you can see we just powered on, connected to the battery, and yeah, we have the lights here. So, I'm just going to try to hide this uh a bit under here, and we should be pretty much good to go. We have one more thing we need to install. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, uh, I did just the final part. I installed something called the flow deck here. And that means that everything should be good to go. We already tested the battery. So, now it's just on to working with the software.

### 📋 セクション 18

We're going to use uh AI to try to yeah get this thing flying. Okay. So, what I have done now, as you can see on the screen here, is I have installed the client for the yeah, crazyly. So, I want to try out first to actually just run the drone with my PS controller. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So, you can see down here now we have kind of the PS controller. Let's see if it's seems like it's working. So, I'm just going to scan for my drone. Uh, I need to plug in this antenna first. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, I plugged in the antenna and yeah, you can see I found the drone now. So, I'm just going to put this down. Okay. So, let's try this now. Yeah.

### 💡 セクション 21

Okay, that's pretty good. Yeah, that works. Whoa, that was a big drop. Okay, so it's working perfect with the controller. So, now I'm going to do Now I'm going to try to do Yeah.

### 🔧 セクション 22

with code. So we're going to load up the documentation and try to fly this using yeah code. Okay. So the first thing I want to do then is of course gather the documentation. So the idea now is that we come in blind here.

### 🎯 セクション 23

We're just going to w code this uh swarm drone. So we just go to the documentation. I gathered all the information I could find uh for the documentation. This is Python for the drone and I just compiled it in my crazyfly.m MD and I have some information about the radio how we use that. So that is connected to my USB port.

### 💭 セクション 24

So I loaded up cloud code and I thought we can use cloud code for this. So I just want to start by uh reading the documentation. So let's do read and let's tag crazyfly. And we can tag crazy radio too. So, just read the documentation, familiarize with this, and then we're going to try to do um yeah, just a simple test with code to see if we can just fly the drone and land again, I think.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, let's just start with something simple. So, let's do write a Python code to connect to the drone, check for leveling, then do a simple test, fly 30 cm up, hover for 3 seconds, and land slowly. I call it test 1.py. So, this is going to be our initial test. So, I think the end uh goal today is going to be to we're going to do some pattern flying and then we're going to try to spin maybe.

### ✅ セクション 26

And the final thing I want to try to do is control the drone by using my voice. I don't know if we can do that, but I'm going to try that. So, let's just write out this um try this code here to just test the drone. So, what I think is pretty cool about this is I come in blind here. I have never done anything with this uh this API before and I can just upload everything to claw here and it can help me get started right away and I can dive deeper in later if I want to.

### 📚 セクション 27

And I think this is just so cool with these new large language models and these agents we have here. So you can see we're kind of up and running straight away. And yeah, I guess we just have to test it. So I think the code is done now. So, I'm just going to get my drone ready here.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Okay. So, I placed the drone on the ground and let's just go here and let's try this out. So, I'm just going to do Python. What did we call it? Test one.py.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, let's see if this works now. So, we're going to connect to the drone. That looks good. I think it's blinking yellow. Uh, checking if drone is level.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And let's see. Okay, that's pretty cool, right? So that was three seconds and then land slowly. Wow, that was perfect. Okay, so that was pretty cool.

### ⚡ セクション 31

You can see we can just follow along here as uh it went up to 30 cm because we have the sensors on the drone. The flow deck is kind of measuring the height to the floor. So that is a pretty cool start, I think. So, I think the next thing we're going to do is ask for a code to uh let's say that was perfect. Let's do um spin.py pi where the drone hover at let's say 50 cm while spinning around its axis something like this uh for three rounds then land slow.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Let's try that. So this is pretty cool now because now we kind of have everything set up. We have connected we have the radio. So now we can just start playing around using the claw agent here to help us write this Python code. Okay, so that was done.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So let's see now. So I'm just going to do what do you call it? Python spin.py and I'm going to grab my camera here. And let's start the code. Okay.

### 📋 セクション 34

And I'm going to go over here now. So let me bring the camera to see the drone. Okay. So it looks like it's connecting. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Okay, here we go. So now I want to see. Yeah, it is spinning. I guess you can see it. It's spinning around its axis.

### 📝 セクション 36

You can see the lights moving around. So that's pretty cool. And if we look at the code now, you can see it's kind of getting the sensor information. So I think that was it. One more round, I think.

### 💡 セクション 37

And then it's going to land right like this, I think. Okay. and then slowly down. Okay, that was pretty cool. So, I think the next thing we're going to try is actually Let me put the camera down.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So, I think the next thing we're going to do is um I want to do an eight figure pattern and after that I want to work a bit on how we can actually control this with our voice, I think. Okay. Okay, so we can see uh Claude wrote the code. I'm just going to open this in a new terminal to kind of get the stream here. So, let me grab the camera here and let's run it so you can see it connecting.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Okay, I'm going to go over here to see. So, we want to see a figure. Okay, here we go. So, I want to see a figure eight, right? Okay, so it is moving.

### 💭 セクション 40

Yeah, that is kind of like a figure eight. You can see it's going in this eight figure here. Yeah, that's pretty cool. So, if you look the code, that should be it. And it should go down now.

### 📌 セクション 41

Perfect. [snorts] So, you can see how easy that was. We didn't really need like a lot of time to it's very short amount of time from setting this up to actually have something working. So that is just so cool with this um AI agents and if I was going to do this like 5 years ago, this would have taken me like days because I'm very slow. So that is just super fun.

### ✅ セクション 42

And we got all the logging here, right? We can play around with if we want to. And we got some data collection here. And we let's say we added some wind here. We can see the data.

### 📚 セクション 43

Maybe we needed some more power because of the wind speed. And we can just do a bunch of stuff like this. So now I'm going to try to set up a voice control for this. That's going to take a bit more time. So yeah, for you it's going to be 1 second, I guess.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Okay. So I did the prompt here. So I'm just going to show you the prompt I used. Uh next is going to be to create a voice control of the drone. So read uh the documentation I gathered.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So the documentation was just a speechtoext documentmentation from OpenAI. and I put in my API key. Uh, what I want is a push push to move drone command. So I can press and hold M and I can say move 50 forward, 150 backwards, 50 left and so on. So yeah, that was basically all the information I gave it.

### 🚀 セクション 46

We have the documentation for the drone. We have the documentation from OpenAI. And I ended up with something I think is successful. So I'm just going to show you how this works. Now we ended up with voice control.py and this is uh 8 no 630 lines of code and I did test it and this seems to work pretty good.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So I'm just going to play you show you a demo now. So let's just set up the drone and let's record me trying to control the drone by just using voice command here. So we are using whisper to transcribe my voice to command to send to the drone. Okay. So when I run a voice control.py now hopefully we can connect to the drone.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Perfect. And this should start hovering now. So I'm going to try to film this. So let's see. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Perfect. So now we can start voice control. So I can just press M here. Move 50 left. Okay.

### 📋 セクション 50

So that's working. Move 150 right. So it should come towards us. 150 right. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So it's coming towards us. Okay. That was pretty far. Move 50 backwards. So you can see it's coming towards me now.

### 📝 セクション 52

Okay. That was pretty cool. 200 forward. Okay, so now it's going forward. So we are voice controlling this now.

### 💡 セクション 53

So that's pretty cool. And I can just press Q and it should land, right? Yeah. I don't know if you see that, but okay. Boom.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So that was perfect. So that is how easy it is actually to just Whoa, that was a lot of M's to set up a voice control with the drone, right? And this is not trivial, right? This would have taken uh a lot of effort just a few years ago, but now with the new generative AI agents and tools, super easy to do. So I want to try one more thing.

### 🎯 セクション 55

I don't know if this is going to work, but I want to try it out anyway. Okay, you can see on the screen here the prompt I'm going to send to cloud code. I'm not going to read out everything, but basically the idea here is that we're going to connect the LLM to the so it has access to the logging from the drone while it's flying in real time and it can make command. So the the object is to have a 3 or 3 * 3 m area and we're going to place an object and the idea is that the drone is going to cooperate with OpenAI LLM to search that area and find the object and land on it. That is the main idea.

### 💭 セクション 56

So I'm going to send this to Cloud Code now and it's going to start working on the code. Hopefully we get something. Yeah. I'm just going to give Cloud Code some time to cook this up and I'm going to place an object on the floor and let's see if the drone can find it and land on it with cooperation with OpenAI here. Let me go through how it set up this code now.

### 📌 セクション 57

So, it's going to use the flow deck height sensor to kind of look at the height differences from the ground. And you can see uh the search area is flat except for the object. When flying over an object, the ground is now closer, of course, to the drone. And we're going to use the range sensor. And we have a baseline calibration.

### ✅ セクション 58

So it takes off. Measure the average to uh to the ground. 30 samples. Okay. We're going to do a grid search.

### 📚 セクション 59

We're going to do height sampling, LLM analysis, and object detection. Is this going to work? And yeah, we are ready to run this. Uh but first, let's start the camera. Okay.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So, let's run this. Now, before we do that, let's place out the drone. So, I'm just going to put it over here somewhere. Okay. Because the drone has like a starting point and from there it's going to start its grid search.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, I'm just going to fire up the camera now and follow the drone. So, let's just start this and when we can see the path of the drone. I'm going to place the object in the path. Okay. So, let's see if it's starting.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Okay, that looks pretty good. And it's going to find its starting point. Now it's just going to do the baseline height and it's going to move over to its starting point and from there it should start the grid search. Okay, so it's moving. So we're going to place this in its path, right?

### ⚡ セクション 63

Something like this. So let's see what happens when the drone flies over the object. Now let's see if it detects it. Okay, so something happened. Is it going to try to land?

### 🌟 セクション 64

Okay, so we just dropped down. Uh, but I guess that was a success, right? Yeah, we landed on the object and descending. Okay, that didn't happen. So, there are some issues with the code here, but pretty much what we were looking for, I guess.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So you can see we have the anomaly detected plus 50. Okay. So yeah, I wouldn't say that was perfect, but if I worked a bit more on the code here, I think we can get this to work, right? So we can search the full grid and kind of get um detection when we find a object that is elevated or elevated from the ground, I guess. [snorts] So yeah, pretty cool.

### 📋 セクション 66

So yeah, that was basically all I wanted to do today. And you can see I had a lot of fun with this drone here. And it just I think it just shows if you have the documentation and you have these LLMs. Now, this could be any LLM, I guess, and some creativity. There's a lot of stuff you can do now just right out of the box.

### ⭐ セクション 67

You don't really need a lot of like um knowledge up front because you can just use the LLMs, the agents to get you started and then you can dive deeper in. So we made like a autonomous search. Now we have the voice control and we did some other tests with just pure scripting. So super fun and I'm looking forward to playing around more with this. See what we can do.

### 📝 セクション 68

So now we only have the laser, right? And let's say we have a camera here. Then we can maybe use some APIs to look at things. We can do maybe some bounding boxes. I don't know.

### 💡 セクション 69

This is probably something I'm going to do in the future. But for now, yeah, this was the video. Hope you enjoyed it. Hope this gave you some inspiration. This was not a sponsored video, but I might ask them if they want to do a sponsor so we can have many of these so we can do a big swarm like a big like a swarm.

### 🔧 セクション 70

So yeah, hope this gave you some inspiration and as always, thank you for tuning in. Have a great day and we speak
