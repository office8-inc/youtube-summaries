## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This might be my last vlog here in Dubai. Let me tell you why. [music] [music] I always wanted an in-person office and all of my businesses were remote, but I want to try bringing my team together in one place. Poland is I think right now the best country in uh Europe. fastest economic growth since covid safest low immigration it's very entrepreneurial you know even if I compare it to Czech Republic the polls are they have more hustle like for example our airports you know except for Prague don't really work you know a lot of checks go to Poland to just take a flight so that's one example what made you realize you wanted to start at the office one day I did random deep research on the percentage of startups that reached unicorn status which is $1 billion valuation or more.

### 📋 背景・概要

What percentage of them did that with a fully remote team? And it was like almost zero. So over 99% of startups that reached $1 billion made it with a locked in inerson team. And that's a very strong pattern that you don't see every day. So when I realized that, I began thinking, hm, you know, my team is already very locked in.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

We work every day. How much more focused would we be if we were in a single location? And that's where I got the idea to start an in-person office. >> So David, what have you learned during the 12 months of building AI company? >> Probably the biggest thing is that you have to build what the market wants.

### 📝 詳細説明

A lot of people create some fancy technology that nobody needs. You have to solve a real problem that people will pay money for. let [music] you know. [music] >> So, as Jensen Hank, the CEO of Nvidia says, you should always start with the highest importance work first. So, that's what we're going to do.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So I've read a lot of startup focused books and also some like programming books but the best one I would say probably has 0ero to1 from Peter Teal and the main idea is that you want to build a startup that can become a monopoly right something that can be 10x better than anything else because that's how you actually make profits if you compete with everybody then you just undercut each person and nobody makes money. >> So man, where are we going right now? >> We're going to the Nequil Mall and more specifically to the view which is like a single spot where you can see the entire Palm JRA. Yeah, I just like to, you know, change the scenery few times a day because it makes you more productive, especially if you really push to the limits, you know, 60 minutes, 90 minute deep work, then you're kind of exhausted. And if you change environment, maybe go to a cafe or restaurant, you can work even more.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

>> And so what do you hate about Dubai? Well, obviously the traffic, you know, especially in downtown in Marina, the really busy spots, the traffic is terrible. But also the air quality. This is something people don't realize. Like for example, today you can barely see into the distance.

### 🎯 応用例

If it if the air was perfect, you could see Burj Khalifa right now, but you can't because the air quality index is like 150 or maybe even 200. And that is very unhealthy. And if you spend even like 1 hour or 2 hour outside, you will feel it the next day and you have a sore throat. And yeah, it's it's not good. [music] Crazy make me feel like my emotions.

### 💭 考察

I stayed up. It's the thing I seen and the I've [music] been doing make my heart turn cold. >> A lot of people don't understand that people can like their work. You know, when I say that I work every day and I work 10 plus hours a day. It's not I'm forcing myself to do it.

### 📌 まとめ

It's not like I have to do it. It's just like I would hate not working. Like the worst thing you could do to me right now is to put me on a beach and tell me, "David, you have to lay on the beach for 7 days." Like I I would probably die. >> Hey David, what do you think about the dating market here in Dubai? >> Yeah, it's interesting.

### ✅ 結論

Uh I would say there's a lot of beautiful women here, but there is no wives, you know? So if you want to find something longterm and something quality, probably you should look in central eastern Europe, not Dubai. At least that's my experience because the the people who are in a good relationship here always import their women, you know. So, like they were already in a relationship and then they moved to Dubai. But here, if you want to meet a girl, you probably have like a week or two from the moment she comes until she's ruined by the city.

### 📚 追加情報

>> Do you think having a girlfriend would help you to scale your business? >> Definitely not. >> Why is that? >> I mean [laughter] I mean unless she's like Leila Hermosi, like I I don't know how that would help. I mean you can say you know I could outsource all the but like I already have a cleaner you know I already can order from restaurants so >> so so let's say you are looking for someone as Leila Hormoni >> the way I say it is that I don't talk to any women except for my future wife so what that means is that the moment I realize a girl is not going to be my wife I just don't waste any time on her and I think it's a huge strength because a lot of guys spend multiple hours a week texting women you know going on dates even with girls they don't want to be with longterm it's a huge time waste.

### 🔖 補足

And yeah, I think if you can control that, you have you unlock so much energy and so much time. [music] >> I feel so much pressure that I'm going to get [music] the B and I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity. That's why everybody calls me Mr. [music] Infinity. >> What's going on?

### 🎨 セクション 13

Why are you not working by the desk? I mean, we were sitting all day, so it's good to stand up, but there's no standing desk in this Airbnb, so we had to improvise a bit. Microwave by itself was too low, so we found this Monopoly. So, now I'm building my own software Monopoly on top of the game of Monopoly. [music] >> Riders on the storm.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Into [music] this house we're born. >> Into this world we're thrown into this world. [music] >> So another benefit of living in Dubai is that you can meet a lot of people. For example, yesterday I met with one guy who knows me from YouTube and he's in the new society actually and we met in the Armani Hotel which is insane, right? This is the benefit of having a community, right?

### ⚡ セクション 15

When I was in New York last month, I also met a couple of new society members. So, if you're serious about AI and if you want to meet me in person, make sure to join the new society because I'm traveling all the time and who knows, maybe I'm in your country next and we could meet up. But regardless where I'm at, the new society is for those who want to be serious about AI and who want to be on the cutting edge and want to build a business with it. So, link below, join now. So, what other sport are you doing apart from pedal?

### 🌟 セクション 16

>> Okay, so it depends where I'm at. In Czech Republic, I like to do mountain biking nearly every day. That's my favorite sport. When I was younger, I used to trampoline, but you know, I don't do it as much, but hopefully I [music] do more of it, get back into it. So, those are my favorite sports.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And football in Czech Republic, she's not [music and singing] for me. That's the type that put me in my mood. >> She know that on my [music] she for me. She know how to put me in my groove. >> Okay.

### 📋 セクション 18

>> I know it's a lot [music] that you can learn from me. It's just one thing that you got to prove. >> Straight up. If you got [music] a ride for [singing] me, I might need extra for the >> Every day I eat steak, at least one, but usually two. And I like to do a lot of salt because, you know, I have this saying that you can see it's not salty enough.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Especially in Czech Republic, we always [music] eat soup and a main dish. And when I look at the soup, I always can see that it's not salty enough. So, I begin salting heavily even before eating. And steak is just a superfood. Steak and eggs are the two best foods in the world.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, I eat as much of them as possible and I try to get as many calories from steak and eggs in my day. [music] [singing] >> So, David, what is the next step? So the next big step is really starting an inerson office. Ever since 15 16 years old, all of my businesses were fully remote. So that is the next big step.

### 💡 セクション 21

Start the office in Warsaw, move my team there and push 10 times harder. >> Why do you think most people fail? >> I think it comes down to mindset. Because if you label failure as the end, you know, like you launch a business, it didn't work out and it's the end and you go back to having a 9 to5. Like that's the mindset issue.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It's not an issue of failing, right? Because even if you go like let's say you build your own startup, right? You scale it uh for 12 months. You're going to learn so much in those 12 months if you work every single day on it. Even if that company fails, it's not a failure.

### 🎯 セクション 23

You've learned infinite amount and now you can make a much better decision to launch the next thing. So I would say if people fail, it's more about like they label it as a failure and it's a mindset issue because if you keep going and if you never give up then each failure is just a part of the bigger step. A lot of people would think that moving to Warso is like the biggest problem that I'm currently facing. But that's nowhere near the biggest issue. I mean moving to a different country, you know, if you've done it for if you've never done it, it's hard.

### 💭 セクション 24

But if you've done it multiple times like I have, it's pretty easy. The biggest problem is that in vectal my software company we've been around like 10k MR for you know half a year. So the revenue is kind of stagnating or the growth is very slow right. So and the reason why growth is very slow is because manufacturers churn finding the ideal target avatar finding like which features market wants because we added ton of features we can ship fast but then a lot of them were not used so we had to remove them and that took like a week or two weeks. So that is the hardest part realizing okay at what point do we either do a hard pivot or at what point should I launch maybe another software company because this one has been you know around $10,000 a month for a while and you know it it's there is no clear answer.

### 📌 セクション 25

A lot of a lot of things in business have a clear answer. you know, work harder or fire the underperformer. But you never know whether you should persevere with a business that is kind of stagnating or growing slowly or whether you should pivot and launch something new. So that is by far the hardest part, hardest decision I have to make in the next 1 to 3 months. >> David, what is one habit that you recently started doing?

### ✅ セクション 26

>> I started reading a lot more in the last month. Maybe I think in the last 3 weeks I read more books than in the entire year before that. And the reason is simple because when you are facing a big issue in your life, in your business, doesn't matter, you want to read the best books on that topic. And if you just read like three or four books, you're already going to gain so much knowledge. The best learning habit is actually using GBD5 Pro.

### 📚 セクション 27

So if you have the top GHB subscriptions, I'm going to show you. Boom. GBD5 Pro right here in the model selector. And this model, if you ask it like what are the biggest mistakes software startup founders make, it thinks for 4, 5, 6, 10, 15 minutes sometimes, right? Crazy amount of thinking.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And what I do is when I'm reading, I'm using GBD5 Pro to ask questions and to do like active learning. And this is very OP because it allows me to internalize information way more than if I was just reading. So David, what is the best advice you heard recently? >> I would say that for me it is that startup founders and CEOs cannot hesitate. The worst thing you can do as a founder is to hesitate.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Often times you're dealt with two terrible choices, right? Both option A and option B are very difficult and very ugly. But the worst thing you can do is not decide and kind of you know put the problem to the side and try to delay it. That is the worst thing. And it's a advice from Ben Horowitz, the founder of Andre Horovitz, which is one of the most successful VC investment firms in the world.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And yeah, the worst mistake a startup founder can make is to hesitate. So when you have two difficult decisions and both of them seem very bad and very ugly, just pick one and move fast. Do not hesitate. Do not delay it.
