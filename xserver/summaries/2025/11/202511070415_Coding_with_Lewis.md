## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

As a developer, there's always a better way to stay productive, which is why I'm partnering with IBM to build this agent [music] with Watson X orchestrate. So, I created this 2e application right here that connects to all of my services like [music] Slack, Gmail, Notion, and more. And so, I'm using Watson X orchestrate to build agents that could easily extract the information from messages, emails, and other unstructured data to create a task list for me and prioritize it. So when I'm building out this TUI, I can actually just connect to Watson X orchestrate using an API [music] request similar to if you were using any other LLM provider. However, I can easily manage all of [music] the MCP servers and integrations within Orchestrate.

### 📋 背景・概要

So I built a web hook that will do a chat request whenever a new email or message comes in. I then have the agent automatically process it and have it access to other agents in case it needs context or perform [music] other actions on my behalf like sending a message through Slack for example. And with this TUI that I built is really fast and I can see everything from a topown level. Things change constantly as a developer and Watson X orchestrate makes updating everything [music] just dead simple.
