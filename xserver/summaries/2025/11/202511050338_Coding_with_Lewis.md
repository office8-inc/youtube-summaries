## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

huge drama in the world of programming and sadly it's something we see often. Mino is a tool that lets developers store files and objects in an Amazon S3 compatible way. This is key for testing locally without getting cloud costs. But then someone on GitHub issues asked about a new Docker release. Mo then said that this project is a source distribution and wouldn't release a Docker build.

### 📋 背景・概要

And people were pissed obviously, but it is maybe a little bit overblown. Now, this is a little inconvenient at most. You're still able to build your own Docker image with the source code, which is under a permissive license. I mean, someone's probably already doing it as we speak. But other red flags came to light, like the removal of their documentation.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, even though this specifically might be a nothing burger, the breadcrumbs are lining up. Mo has raised over $126 million and we have seen open- source projects to then company pull the rug from underneath like Reddus or Terraform. But what's your thoughts though? Is this a nothing burger or signs of a tail that we're used to
