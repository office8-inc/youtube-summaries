## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

One of the biggest myths in AI is that you need to be a technical genius to build a real business. But what if you could go from having zero coding experience to not only running a profitable AI agency, but also building a million dollar SAS from scratch? So today, I'm sitting down with Albert, who did exactly that. And in the last year, he's built a combined AI agency, info product, and SAS business that's now doing over 160K per month collectively. And in this interview, he's going to be revealing his entire blueprint, like everything.

### 📋 背景・概要

how he survived the initial four months of failure when trying to start his agency to getting his first clients using what he calls a clever decoy offer. The exact copypaste content strategy that he's used to get $240,000 followers in just 8 months. And the step-by-step process he used to build his own $100,000 per month AI SAS product without writing a single line of code himself. So, let's get into it. All right, Albert, mate, great to finally meet you.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Um excited to have you on to hear your journey. So, um what are you going to share with us today? >> I have a lot of [ __ ] prepared for you guys today. I'll show you how exactly I went from zero to 240,000 followers in eight months. How I bcoded a million dollars ads with no coding experience.

### 📝 詳細説明

And also, if you're just starting up, what I think is the best way that you can get into AI right now. I've broken it up in four steps. How I started to how I built software and then how I scaled on social media. If you're just starting out, I always recommend that you start with a service-based business. If you just like me and you scroll Instagram, you're going to see day trading crypto.

### 💡 実例・デモ

The problem with those business models is that it takes money to make money. It's the name of the game. So, what I did when I started out is that I looked after service- based businesses, things where you can learn a skill with your time and then monetize that skill, like an AI agency, like social media marketing. And the way I started out is that I was in Melbourne on vacation when I met this random guy that came up to us in a hostel with one of those cheap wine boxes. You know, the 2 L ones with the absolute worst quality.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

>> I've had a few of those >> when I was traveling. >> Yeah, >> same thing. >> But you showed me this brand new thing which was Chad JDT and it's probably the most mind-b blown I've ever been in my life from seeing a product. I knew this [ __ ] was going to change the world. So when I came back from vacation, I had two paths I could go on.

### 🎯 応用例

I could either go to uni, study five years software development, which was kind of my original plan, or I could go all in on this new AI thing where the outcome was really unknown because I barely knew what it was yet. And I simply couldn't decide. So to help me decide, I made a goal for myself that I would hit 10K a month in six months. And if I didn't do that, I'll have to quit business, go to uni. And this is a picture of myself looking a little mad because four months in, I had had around 15 appointments, $0 closed, $0 in revenue, a staggering 0% close rate, and around 50 bucks in my bank account, barely being able to pay rent.

### 💭 考察

And at this point, I thought I was a complete failure by looking at the stats. But what I didn't realize back then is that those four months were probably where I had the most growth in my entire life because I was learning the skills. I then changed one thing which is that I said [ __ ] the money for now. And I started to work for free. Well, I did it with a twist.

### 📌 まとめ

I use what I now later call a decoy offer where you offer something for free just to get customers in the door. This could be something like a free website or a free website widget. Let's take the example with the website. Head over to Google Maps, find the companies that don't already have a website and call them up and say, "Hey man, I see you don't have a website. Do you want me to build you one completely for free?" Then a lot of people are going to be interested in that.

### ✅ 結論

You're gonna hop on a call with them and you're gonna ask more questions about the website that they want and you want to do a really good job here because you're creating good well. But what you then do is that you go in and you build this in a standard website builder using a template like go high level and you give this website in exchange for a video testimonial already. That is a massive win because not only are you learning the skills like servicing a client, but you're also getting something in return, a video testimonial, even though it might not make money yet because what you can do afterwards is after you've provided a service for free. You have stored up goodwill and now you can use that goodwill to upsell. You can do that by copying it together and saying, "Well, now you're going to get a lot of leads from your website.

### 📚 追加情報

Do you want a place to store those leads? I can help you implement a CRM." And the way you do that is that you charge something up front. I'm really showing everything right now. And here's what I call the proof of concept offer, which is that you say to them, it's going to be x amount of dollars for the setup, but you're going to pay you're going to pay up front, but I'll literally build the entire thing for you so you can see exactly what it will look like and take an informed decision. And if you don't like it after I build it, you can get a complete free refund to do that with any really upfront payment that you take.

### 🔖 補足

And I can't really stress how much money this offer is making because it makes it so easy to say yes and it removes all the risk that is involved. So you do that and then after you provided a CM to them, you upsell them again. You say, "Well, now you have a website. You want me to help you traffic convert more of that traffic using a website widget and you stack services on top of that. If you're really good, then you've already created a demo for them where they can see exactly what it would look like on their website.

### 🎨 セクション 13

This is built with my software. Um, you can show them exactly what the website widget would look like. You stack services on top of each other like voice agents, review agents. You can even run Google and Facebook ads and all of a sudden you're charging a couple hundred dollars a month for a couple of services that started with a free website. What will happen is that you'll become what I call an internet partner, which is that every time they want something changed on their website or they want something that they've seen online, they go to you.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And you see some of my internet partners here over two years have paid me 11, eight, and 8k in revenue on lifetime value. If you haven't gotten your client yet and you're sitting in Albert's position that I was there 4 months in, do this. Do it with 50 clients and I can almost guarantee you that you're going to land your first client. This is really interesting and it's it's a pattern that I'm starting to see more and more is um the reality of creating AI systems for businesses is it's what they all want, but it's actually it's the it's the cherry on top of everything else. Uh like there's so many other systems that are needed for it to be for it to actually work.

### ⚡ セクション 15

I call like the rails that a company needs to be able to use generative AI properly. And a lot of the time if you just try to go direct to the solution at the end, like not just being an AI agency that only does AI development, you almost need to have the the general software development. In your case, you're doing a small businesses, but you're being the internet partner and setting them up on a CRM that's going to allow you to plug in the uh the voice agent or to plug in the uh the website agent. And in this case, that's what you've done to to stack these sort of retainers. But I think that's something that that people should be willing to sort of roll their sleeves up and say, "Hey, look, if I really want to make money with AI, I might need to kind of roll my sleeves up and start going into the non AI areas occasionally." And I mean you should be quite eager to do that because a lot of the time these things are much easier to deliver and and uh create value with um like the software failure rates of uh like AI systems is way higher than just the typical like software development whether you're doing general dev for like say vibe coding a website for them or in your case just building at ongo high level.

### 🌟 セクション 16

there are these sort of additional revenue sources that I think a lot of people might close their eyes to um that are actually going to be a lot easier um than AI development and integration like a multi- aent system for for a business. So, it's interesting to see how you've stacked those four wins. Okay, guys, very quickly, if you're an aspiring entrepreneur and want to start your own AI business and you haven't already joined my free school community, it's down there in one of the links in the description below. has my full free course on how to start your own AI agency as a complete beginner. And you're surrounded by over a quarter million people who are also striving towards the same thing.

### 🎬 セクション 17

There's no better place on the planet right now to be surrounded by like-minded people and you get free weekly Q&A with me where you can ask questions directly to me about how to start and scale your business. I'll see you in there. >> And that's exactly how I made my first 400 bucks in that in that month four. And I also wrote it right here. If I did this from the start, I would probably have done it in in month one.

### 📋 セクション 18

It's about not being, you know, that proud when you design. >> Yeah. So, were you going for like were you pitching like 2K, 3K automation projects or something? Uh, on a lot of those earlier ones, >> I was pitching something that was way too advanced for the local businesses that I actually got in contact with when I could just I've started from scratch and then something really cool happens when you start building their business on top of your systems. If they wanted to go out and get a voice agent afterwards, who do you think they're they're going to?

### ⭐ セクション 19

They're going to you. >> Interesting. Yeah. I mean, there's so many when I look at at the AI space and you really realize how long it's going to take for a lot of this stuff to to roll out and actually be be distributed throughout the whole whole world. Um, when there's so many small businesses who are I mean business of all sizes who are just not ready for it in any way like the software or the systems that they're running um the CRM they have uh are just not really equipped at all for this.

### 📝 セクション 20

And there's we do need this distributed workforce of of small agencies to go to these small small businesses. It's like it's so much easier to move the needle for them because it's really like I can put you on a good CRM. I can plug in a few automations. As soon as you get to these sort of midsize and enterprise companies, uh it's the complexity goes through the freaking roof and small businesses are really where a lot of the a lot of the lift in AI is being seen. Um cuz it's just too complicated for the these big organizations integrate.

### 💡 セクション 21

>> 100%. That's also one of the the problems I see in the in the AI space at the moment. And the mistake that I made as well is that when I started out, I focused way too much on the on the tech. You know, I watched a new video, a new model just came out and I tried to explain this new model to my client when in reality, you know, I should be focusing on the sales skills. That is I'd almost argue 50% of an AI agency is definitely marketing and sales.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Um, and that's also one of the reasons why we built Build My Agent. We wanted to make the tech so easy that people realize, okay, now I know the tech, I can go out and actually focus on getting clients. >> People get so caught up in in all the new flashy stuff. I did a video recently and on like if you could just focus on five areas like there's there's five areas of the the space. I'll link link the video down below, but like these are kind of like guaranteed bets.

### 🎯 セクション 23

If you just focus on the skills in any of those five areas I mentioned, then it'll be pretty much impossible for you to not make some kind of money uh over over the course of probably 12 months. I'd say people get so caught up in the in the new releases, but you your companies that you work with are not going to want experimental tech and you know, we've we've gone so far in the past two two three years. >> You could literally take tech from two years ago and plugging it in and still making a lot of money. So getting so caught up in the news cycles is is not really beneficial for for agency owners when they're starting out. >> So now people know how to get their first client, not be so proud and go out and do the work.

### 💭 セクション 24

And I mentioned an example here with cold calling. You can also do this on Facebook and on LinkedIn. Don't have time in this video, but I'll link tutorials right here. This my like this ball will be probably in the description. Go and watch those yourself.

### 📌 セクション 25

There's Loom videos on those too. And same with the cold calling. Not going to go too much into detail. Oh, but there's a docs right here that explains our cold calling scripts that we have seen the best results. >> I've heard depending on the industry, you can get some really good results with with cold calling if you like understand the kind of business you're calling and you're not coming in as just a complete like completely newbie to it or at least you can get inside their head and understand what the maybe you know what what CRM or what software they use.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh typically for those kinds of companies, it can be a real good hook to like get get their attention and uh and get a a discovery meeting booked in. >> Yeah. I see people booking 10 meetings a day on cold calling just because they know the industry. They're completely right. >> Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 27

And it's one of those good bunch where you can just sit down and and bash it out. Like I've got some kids that I'm mentoring and they're like, "Okay, we need some leads. All right, let's just sit here for a day and like fill the pipeline back up again." And they're loving it. >> So set some expectations. This right here, when you are cold DMing and you're cold calling and you're putting in the work, it's what I call the grind phase because you have absolutely no leverage yet.

### 🔖 セクション 28

You can't really hire anyone to do the [ __ ] work. You just have to do it yourself. And it's really just about getting those first three clients, I would say, that are paying you on a monthly basis because of three reasons. You want sales experience and you also want experience in how to actually do the service delivery. And then you want to make a little money that you can reinvest into the next thing I'm going to show you, which is ads.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And that's how we scaled to to 50k a mark. >> I'm really interested in this because we've never had to run any ads and I I think even just retargeting could be something that we could get a lot out of. >> Yeah. When I started out and I tried to search up AI agency ads two years ago, there was nothing I needed to. So I had to spend 100k to learn this, but I'm I'm going to show you guys in 5 minutes.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So, the first camp campaign that you want to do, and you can even do this while you're reaching out to companies, is a retargeting campaign because you're DMing someone, they go to your website, then with a Facebook pixel like this one right here, you can track the visitors. So, if someone goes to your website, they want to see what you do, you can keep showing them ads, and that makes you seem like a really credible company. The way you set this up is that you go and set up the metapixel on your website. Then you create an audience 180 days retention. I'm not going to go too much in detail about all the the settings, but you have them all here.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Some worth mentioning is that you can save set a very low budget. You can spend $3 a day on retargeting. It's still going to give you good results. Then you want to set the countries that you don't want to work with. And you just set the website pixel as the targeting.

### 🌟 セクション 32

and meta is going to start showing you ads or start showing your visitors ads on Facebook. You even have all our ads right here that has performed the best. I even made a docs right here that you can go check out that has our best performing ads and the performance right under it. Uh so you can get some inspiration, use it niche and you can see if you set up a really good retargeting campaign, you can get this is one of ours 230 leads for 1,600 bucks. And you got to remember these leads are people that gone to your website already.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So they are warm warm. You even have my um my copy right here. These are the the copy that has performed best for us. Not going to go too much in detail. You can check all this out yourself.

### 📋 セクション 34

Some things that worth mentioning is you want to use industry lingo. The Facebook algorithm. If you mention solar business, it will know and I'll target solar businesses. You also want to mention a painoint. Then you have the butt and then we have the offer and then we have a CTA.

### ⭐ セクション 35

The CTA that has performed the best for us is something like a free demo and a call. So actually showing people exactly what it is that you're selling. That's also what why we did this demo feature inside of Build My Agent. So you can actually show exactly, okay, this is how it works over SMS. You can read all this copy yourself and our headlines.

### 📝 セクション 36

So that's the first campaign. The first campaign that you're ever going to do on is this one campaign right here. And this is going to be the 22 or 80% of results. This is going to get you a lot of leads over the long run. Campaign number two is what I always recommend doing a lead form campaign.

### 💡 セクション 37

And here you want to do a minimum of around 15 bucks a day. Campaign objective still leads. And if you want to here because it's cold traffic, you can set an age like over 25 because usually business owners would be over that. I like to set one interest targeting that's like very niche to what I'm trying to target like solar inverter. No one is going to be interested in a solar inverter if they're not in the solar industry.

### 🔧 セクション 38

But even then I still use as a suggestion some meta pixel or the meta algorithm can still show to outside of that. >> What made you go on on on the solar thing here? >> I was running marketing for some solar companies. I when I started out I was very broad. I did AI.

### 🎯 セクション 39

I did marketing as well. So I already knew the industry. I knew the lingo. I knew what they wanted. And Solar is just a really like if you create sales agents in Solar, it's very high ticket and it's very high lead volume, which is usually what you want in an AI agency, right?

### 💭 セクション 40

>> They pretty much run the same. >> Yeah, they all they all have the same SOPs, the same systems, the same leads that come in. Um, so you can really just by one system and get really good results from many solar companies. Then you want to add some uh qualifying questions like what is the name of your company? How long have you been in business?

### 📌 セクション 41

What is the size of your team? And here's a bonus because a lot of people they run ads and they get unqualified leads is how to fix that in one minute. You turn on conditional logic inside of your lead form and then you set a question like what is the size of your team where 05 and 5 to 20 is going to disqualify them and everything above that is going to be a successful lead because what that does is that it trains that algorithm that you're only interested it only sees those leads that are 20 plus as a success. So, your lead cost is going to go up a bit, but you're going to train the algorithm to find more qualified leads. If you do that correctly, you can see you can get campaigns to $13 a B2B lead, which is pretty insane.

### ✅ セクション 42

>> So, these are cold traffic, $12 per lead. And what was the sort of qualification rate is probably step one. Once they actually get on the call, uh, would be what I'm interested in. Is it like, I don't know, 50% of them are actually qualified and and could actually be a a potential client, or what sort of qualification rates did you see? Facebook leads are tough.

### 📚 セクション 43

When we implemented conditional logic, it's probably around even then like 40%. So the real number of like qualified lead would be they're over double this, right? Or still like 25 bucks maybe a qualified lead still something you can build a pretty scalable business on top of. >> At this point, what's your your offering? Are you giving them like cuz you've obviously got all those services that you've just mentioned before.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Are you just kind of going here's the menu, what do you want and you can do all this or have you got like a specific I guess a solar offer is going to be something around like website chatbot or voice agent or or you narrow down to something there. So what was the what was the offer? >> We have a really good offer which is that a lot of these sort of companies they have lead databases and like we're talking millions of leads. Usually before AI it would be too expensive to call those leads but with AI we can actually run campaigns completely on result basis so they pay nothing up front. We let AI reactivate and book appointments gets around 1% of those leads booked in if it's decent lead quality and that can turn into a lot of money.

### 🎨 セクション 45

>> Reactivation is one of those great use cases um particularly if you got something like solar where they've running a [ __ ] ton of ads or they've um been building that lead list for a long time. Um, and for those are you running uh just like email or SMS or are you running voice agents as well? Uh what's the what's the mix of of like outreach that you're doing to start those? >> So we usually use SMS uh mostly email works as well but SMS is definitely the best one. It has the highest response rate and feels more personal and a very personalized conversation.

### 🚀 セクション 46

The way we do it is that we always in the initial response try to get them to respond in a way where they need it by asking a question like have you seen your bill going up in recent years. A lot of people are going to say yes to that and instantly there you create a pain or you make them mention the pain of saying okay look into saving some are interested in that. >> You using like the uh go high level vappy air table like kind of Frankenstein stack that that's needed to to run these kind of campaigns or what are you what are you delivering that do? when we started out two two years ago, we used go high level and then later because go high level like to create a good agent uh you got to have a lot of like complicated flows. That's actually also another one of the reasons we build build my agent that it's very it's much easier to run campaigns from inside of there.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Um so that's what we use. But yeah, like it's a massive opportunity because beforehand you wouldn't be able to reactivate all these leads because it would be way too expensive for a human to call them. And I haven't tried it yet because we know SMS works so well. But having voice agents, I think we are right on the edge of them being good enough towards doing outbound um and performance really well. And the way that you scale ads, like we always talk about volume, right?

### 🌟 セクション 48

And volume in ads is two things. It's how much money you can spend. But when you start spending more money, the performance of your ads is going to go like this. So at some point when the performance starts to dip below some metric, that's when you want to rotate the ads. So volume is spend as much money as possible and then rotate ads so you can keep high performance.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And that's exactly how we scaled our agency to 50k a month. And just like I explained with our really good offer of we'll reactivate your database. It's kind of like our intro offer. We can then upsell services on top of that. But we work with billiond dollar companies in more industries than solar as well doing this offer.

### 📋 セクション 50

So you start crushing it, you start scaling your ads. Most AI agencies, they either do one of two things. Either they focus on the higher ticket projects, you know, the 10k projects plus and they thereby have fewer clients that they focus on, or you can also try and commoditize the service by using automation and building software. And that's what we did. Like I mentioned at the start, you don't want to start here.

### ⭐ セクション 51

You don't want to start building software because it can take a lot of money and a lot of time before you make your first dollar return. So if you're just starting out, start with service based company. >> But >> yeah, >> if you're crushing it already, software might be good. >> It kills me, man. It kills me the amount of people I see who have like been on like a good like I can see them doing all the right things with their agency and making progress and then out comes the post like building my SAS and I'm like, "Oh, [ __ ] Please, no." So, I've always been pretty clear about how I see the the automation agency model fitting in.

### 📝 セクション 52

It's like it's an on-ramp for people to get in. It's it's it gives you the the cash flow, the like technical expertise, um the team as well. And it gives allows you to to support those kind of assets and resources that you need to ultimately move into software to maybe work with a client where you do spot an opportunity for a software. But I think a lot of people underestimate just how much cash flow you're going to need to get it up and running. like you need at least one or two full-time devs and that's going to run you 15 20k depending on how good they are uh per month.

### 💡 セクション 53

I know some dudes who you think are making making all sorts of money and they're literally in the red because they're spending so much on their on their software on the SAS team. There's definitely a lot of uh a lot of money to be made in the in the high ticket projects um and getting that right. Ideally, you've got some retainer income coming through with your agency before you start to like diversify into the SAS side because it's uh it's definitely costly and we're we're really investing in that at the moment. I will always recommend to start a service based business, but you can build a lot of software and also get an MVP on the market or like even yourself with the tools that I'm about to show you. It uh they've gotten pretty good at these tools.

### 🔧 セクション 54

If you're crushing it and you want to do software, that's what I did. Like I always had my eye on software. That's what I wanted to do. That's what I wanted to build. And that's also why I started out initially just myself by coding it.

### 🎯 セクション 55

But here's a stepby-step guide to not waste tens of thousands of dollars on developers and actually figure out, okay, do I have a good idea? Wouldn't even call it step one. It's step zero, which is that you say, "Fuck Figma," because you're probably not a professional designer. And instead of wasting a bunch of time doing a mediocre design for your MVP, you you just want to test it. So instead, you go to Vero Marketplace.

### 💭 セクション 56

I think this is a lot better than lovable. and you find additional components that you can use. You can find dashboards. You can find light landing pages. You can take specific components from that and just plug them together and ask AI to prop them together.

### 📌 セクション 57

Then you open it in vis zero. And the great thing about Vzero is that you actually get the code and you can find some really cool landing pages, some really cool components doing this that you can just take and use for your own software. And that's how you can set a minimum viable product and launch something very very quickly. You can see this is a VCO website. If I wanted this for example right here, this globe, I could just take this component and add it to my own landing page.

### ✅ セクション 58

>> That's one of my biggest questions is like where did the the technical expertise on your end end finish and you had to bring in someone else. >> I always say a lot of people think that they can buy Coke their way like to the to the moon, you know, to a billion dollar valuation. That's unfortunately not possible. At some point you need to go out and get developers. What I will say though is that you can get in an initial software on the market that is safe, that has good authentication and good payments and then get that out there and test, okay, is this a good idea and you can even start making your first money and then using that money to buy an audit or hire someone on Upwork to only check for security.

>> And so if you go back onto the to the board, what's your process? You're pulling from VZ down. You've taken those components and then you're putting it into into cursor here. Yeah, you click the three dots right here, download a zip file, unsave it on your computer, and then a lot of people, it's about using the right tools. And that's why a lot of people feel when they write code is that they think they should be using cursor.

### 🔖 セクション 60

That's the most wellknown. We have actually been using Droid from a site called factory.ai. It's more like an enterprise solution. It's both cheaper and we also think that it's a lot better. And the way you use that is that you type it in the terminal type draw it and then you basically have an LLM that has access to your codebase and then you can take these codes that you just got.

### 🎨 セクション 61

You can feed that file to this LLM and just add this component on my landing page and you're good to go. >> So is this like a clawed code competitor knockoff that's cheaper or something? Is that the the idea? >> Exactly. So it's kind of like clawed code but it has all models.

### 🚀 セクション 62

You can see right here I'm using GBC 5 codeex. And what are you using the most for at the moment? >> GBC5 codeex for like backend logic and then I actually like 4.5 set for front end. I think it's better at at doing front end. >> And so you've built this whole thing just just jamming in this Droid interface looking at like your other monitor with apps like running on a local host and you just got VZ like a Droid window up and then the local host on the other other monitor and you're just like pulling components down and chucking it and testing it on the fly.

### ⚡ セクション 63

>> So that's how it started at least. Now we have a development team of free people so they know what they're they're doing. They're real developers but getting it out on the market initially getting the first users that's exactly what we did. So after you've set Droid up on your computer you want to add this is my text stack right here. I'll recommend next for authentication stripe for payments.

### 🌟 セクション 64

If you're in a country where Stripe is not allowed you can use lemon squeeze it. Then for database I'll recommend MongoDB. And the bonus tip is that if you sign up for Microsoft Founders Hop, you can actually get $500 in free credits on MongoDB, which can help with some of those initial costs you're going to have from running the software. If you want to add AI components and you have want to have different models inside of your software, use open router. But if you want to have like one AI thing that's just using one good model, go directly to the model providers because those always cheaper.

### 🎬 セクション 65

And then three steps to become an absolute god vibe coder. This has taken me a long time to learn. The first thing that you want to say is that you always want to keep all files under 500 lines of code. AI when it gets too much too much context starts messing up things. If there's only like a small uh small file it's looking at, it's going to ace it every single time.

### 📋 セクション 66

So by when you build stuff and you build new files, always instructing it and keeping them under 500 lines of code, it's going to save you so much time down the line. Are you putting these into like the uh like cursor rules or or where are you storing that? You just always prompting it at the start of each like Droid session um or is there there some way that you're like kind of baking it all into a into a kind of system prompt? >> I always just write it because it depends on the exact say thing that I want to do. I use this top one right here.

### ⭐ セクション 67

when I create a new file, I don't mean to say this if it's just like looking at some file that's >> correct. >> Um, and for the for the second thing right here, it's when I'm creating something new and I have a like very detailed implementation I want to add. I write, please don't update any code. First, read my code and then ask me any questions you might have to the implementation. It's the classic to make sure that they actually understands what you're trying to implement and that you don't waste a bunch of time for it implementing something where it actually doesn't understand what you're trying to do.

### 📝 セクション 68

And step number three is that you ask it after it has made a plan inside of Droid, you can use plan mode, which basically just plans out the changes before it makes them. If you ask it, is this the best approach for my software to ensure performance liability or simplicity, it's going to look through the changes and it's going to review itself and say, okay, is this actually the best approach? And that's how you a lot of the time can get around those patchy solutions that code sometimes does. So you want to have some you can say guard rails in place, some things you always write to make sure that the AI doesn't create sloppy code. And then step number five is that you don't want to end up like this guy right here.

### 💡 セクション 69

He has spent a year building a software and ended up getting zero users um because he didn't launch early. It took me one month to build the first version of Build My Agent. Not more than one month. And I had no coding experience. And that's just because I knew that I needed to get this out for two reasons.

### 🔧 セクション 70

The first one is that you need to figure out if this is even a good idea. You might just have had some terrible idea now you have spent a year on it. Don't do that. And the second reason is that the best way to improve a product is not by sitting there and trying it yourself and then improving it. It is by getting it in the hands of users so they can actually give valid feedback to him.

### 🎯 セクション 71

>> That's a it's a classic. uh you think you know what people want, but uh even like when you do a ton of market research and you're really sure on what it is, like with the stuff that we're about to launch, I'm pretty confident that it's going to like have to pivot to a a pretty different point than uh than where it is right now. Um but that's just the the nature of the game, isn't it? >> And then when you start, another bonus tip is that you don't want to offer free trials. I see a lot of people making the mistake of giving free trials and then say, "Hey, what do you think?" But you're just going to end up with unmotivated users that are not really in the game.

### 💭 セクション 72

So you need to make sure that people actually want to pay for your software or at least pay for their idea of your software so you can improve it. And that's also how you get those good users that can actually provide real valid feedback. >> Yeah. Let's see how uh how you got so many users on this thing. I think that's a pretty interesting part of your story is is the the Instagram stuff you've been doing.

### 📌 セクション 73

>> 100%. That's why we're showing up. This is how we get 10 million views a month. We've been going for 8 months and I'm very active on X. I always scroll and X and I see a lot of smart people building cool stuff.

### ✅ セクション 74

But what they don't figure out, what they never figure out is how to actually get users. So I'll show you exactly how I went from zero to 235 followers in 8 months. And I know this works because we have not done it once, but we have done it three times both for my business partner and for our business page. So, I can confidently say that if you do this the right way, then it works. And even if you're not trying to build software, I would still say that you should use this because to this day, we get so many messages from companies trying to work with us.

### 📚 セクション 75

And it's a lot better feeling receiving uh requests inbound than having to cold call people. So, I think content is something you should do no matter what. So, here's how we actually did it. It should be a non-negotiable that you should post once a day. And when you're just starting out, you should post a lot of different formats.

### 🔖 セクション 76

This is my best performing formats, and I've receive I've linked uh linked the video right here so you can check them yourself. The first one that made me blew up is the authority hack. It's by taking a clip of someone that has authority in the space like Alexi, Mark Cuban, them talking about something that's relevant like AI because that passes over that authority to you and it also makes people stick in those initial 3 seconds which is very very valuable for the algorithm and this format has gotten me millions of views and it's what initially got my first viral video. >> And then you hit them with the but they never tell you how to do it. That was like that was what that was your hook, right?

### 🎨 セクション 77

I was like that was the that was the followup. I don't know if I saw the Cuban one or if I saw another another one. >> Um did you do you use me on one of the Did you use me on I swear I saw >> I used of you and Alexi maybe I think that was the one but you the video as well >> and then you'd go but they these guys never show you how to do it and then you'd like pull up the in workflow which I thought was a cool way of doing it. >> Yeah. And that's the second format that actually works really well.

### 🚀 セクション 78

A split screen just like has a tutorial of you showing how to do it. So you can like do different variations of these. But you showing something, showing an agent, showing something being built is something that people save and especially like a a make flow or an edit in flow. When people see that, they think, "Oh, that's cool." Then save this. And a new format that we've been trying is the no talks.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So just like a notification power on the phone saying, "I need an AI agent xxx. My budget is x." Then showing how to build it, but with no no audio. That also seems to work really well. >> Interesting. You can check check out all these videos uh yourself.

### 🌟 セクション 80

When you find an outlier, and I would describe that as having 10x the views that you normally get, you want to double down. But let me show you what a vir video actually looks like. You can see it when it starts to show to nonfollowers. So, it's being pushed out on the algorithm. And you can also see in this curve right here that it's way over what my usual reels get.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Then the most important metric that you can look at is this retention curve right here because this gives you the most amount of information. This retention curve is relatively flat which means that people stay. It has a low skip rate. This is people that skip within the first 3 seconds and the average watch time is high. I would say anything over like 18 seconds is really good.

### 📋 セクション 82

Another thing, and this is what I talked about with like the actual things that want people want to save, they find it valuable, is that you can look to the like like to save ratio by creating something that's valuable. You should usually have more saves than likes. And now you know what a good video looks like. Don't do this right here. This is one of my worst videos.

### ⭐ セクション 83

You can see the retention curve absolutely dipping and 70% skipping the video in the first three seconds. And this also absolutely tanks the average horse time. The reason that this retention curve is so valuable is that you can actually see where people drop off. You can see this right here is a bad hook. If you have a good hook but a terrible body, then you can see that you have going to have a drop in the middle of the video.

### 📝 セクション 84

And the same with the end. If you have a terrible CTA, people are going to stay and then at the end they're going to drop. So you know exactly what parts of the video to change out with something else by looking at the retention curve. this side of content so interesting to me cuz I don't really do do short form and it's just a different way of like when I look at the stuff that you do I'm like man I wouldn't even really know where to start with that kind of stuff cuz I'm so used to planning things in this long like my brain is is like speaks in long form and so for me to like I think it's a it's a very interesting skill set to to gain where you have these like cuz with a long form video you're not really sure what made it work sometimes like is it the topic is very broad or it's like the the source in the middle was really good or the hook is really But it's like these are so clearcut. It's like the graph is is 30 seconds.

### 💡 セクション 85

You can tell where the where the interest falls off. Um cuz you can still have a long form video that like doesn't have the craziest hook, but it ends up performing really well cuz some people watch it for an hour. When you start posting these and testing testing testing, you build up that like muscle and kind of understanding of what what's performed well in the past. And I assume you just had to iterate enough time until you felt that like that click and and started seeing this these high views a lot more often. Yeah, >> exactly.

### 🔧 セクション 86

It's by testing formats and then finding the formula that works and and just doing that over and over and over again. >> If you're a business owner who's interested in what generative AI can do for your business, you can get in touch with me and my team at Morning AI in one of the links in the description below and we can start your entire AI transformation process going all the way from the education and training of your staff to the identification of the best AI use cases for your company all the way through to development and beyond. We have worked with some of the world's biggest sports teams and also publicly traded companies. So rest assured, you are in good hands. When it comes to ideiation for this and research on your on your reels, that's always my question because I know what it takes for a long form video.

### 🎯 セクション 87

How much like research and and uh and preparation have to do for for some of them. Are you just like skimming the news? Are you following like a handful of IG pages for for news and then you just ripping that quickly and sort of slapping together things on the fly or you sitting down and doing ideation batches? And this this is always my question around around short form content like what you do. >> Let me let me show you.

### 💭 セクション 88

right here. I don't know what to post. How do you fix that? >> That's right. >> Well, it's that's what I love about short form.

### 📌 セクション 89

You just scroll res. That's the easiest way to get inspiration. And it's very fast to just sit there and scroll res if you have the right algorithm, not some brain rod, but actual the the thing and the niche you want to get into. Then you can get inspiration really easily. You can either do that or just go to my account, go to other accounts that are popping right now and see what they're doing.

### ✅ セクション 90

And that's really the great thing about all content, right, is that it's public. If I wanted to see how Leon blew up on YouTube, I could go back and I can find the videos that made him go viral. You can also just do what I say right here. This is a formula that I know works specifically well for AI agencies. This one of the videos that has gotten us the most clients.

### 📚 セクション 91

You learn something new just like you usually would. New voice agent, the new NN flow. And then in the hook, you explain exactly who it is for like this automation helps Rufus save $10,000 a year. And then you show a demo of what it actually does. Like this is inside of the inflow.

### 🔖 セクション 92

You want to show it actually work. And then this is when most people get wrong. They create like an entire video of how to set it up. You don't want to do that. Just very quickly.

### 🎨 セクション 93

And you go to my Instagram if you don't know how to uh how to do this. Like very quickly just show do this this this just to show that you know how to build it. And then the call to action say if you want a full tutorial just comment template and I'll send it to you. If you do that and you do that on a bunch of different automations, you're going to get clients that are interested. Especially when you call out this automation helps roofers, the algorithm is good enough to find roofers.

### 🚀 セクション 94

>> Yeah, that's a good [ __ ] I mean, I I I saw this stuff working ages ago. Um, where it's like this plumbing automation, it shows like the the inflow that looks kind of complex, but that like the promise is of all this time saving and and cool AI stuff. It's a it's a perfect hook for the the kind of like it's literally just fishing in the algorithm for hey like I'm going to literally call out their avatar at the at the start of it um and let the algorithm do the rest. And then a tip to absolutely farm followers is that when you have a resource like a template, you can before sending the resource ask them this question and you can set this up in go high level where you ask them this is meant to help out the followers. Are you following the page?

### ⚡ セクション 95

If you are, just reply reply with yes and I can send that to you. This I can't even count how many followers this has gotten me. And the algorithm can see what page or what video that people are following you from. So, not only are you going to get more followers, it's also going to improve the performance of your video. After they reply with yes, that's when you send them the resource.

### 🌟 セクション 96

>> Good strate. >> Really? >> Yeah, that's smart. >> Little bonus tip there. And uh a bonus bonus tip, you want to use go high level for this instead of mini chat.

### 🎬 セクション 97

A lot of agencies are only using ManyHat. Um, and this scales with how many messages that you get. You can pay a base fee for go high level and this will literally save you thousands of dollars when you start to blow up. And this is what I meant when I said that uh you can either do it for AI agency, you can get people you can also do this for your software and all you do is just use your own software. I have a lot of videos just me using build my agent.

### 📋 セクション 98

Yeah. >> And then people automatically ask is in an updated album? is that and you can see omagg.io and that's how you can scale a software to uh to $100,000 with 1,600 users. I'll say that learning this right now might be one of the most valuable skills that you can learn right now because software is going to be easier and easier to build. Everyone is going to be building software soon.

### ⭐ セクション 99

But the ones winning are the ones that will actually understand how to get eyeballs and attention and capture that attention and monetize that attention. So this skill right here is definitely something that would help you in the future >> 100%. There's also another layer of question on top of that which is like with content creation potentially becoming kind of commoditized and more accessible what out of all of the creators is the is the stuff that sticks out the most and it's like the the personality or like a unique perspective or is it just the person who's dropping the most value and does it matter if it's an AI avatar or not? Like we're experimenting heavily on the channel at the moment. Um, so yeah, there's a interesting effect that I think is going to go down in in the content sphere as well.

### 📝 セクション 100

>> Very curious what you think of this because I wanted to touch on the future of AI agencies as well. And I made this tweet because I hear a lot of people talking about, oh, I'm way too late late to AI. Everyone is already using AI. Um, so like I wrote that people talk about AI as a trend like NFTs, drop shipping and memecoins, but I really compare it to the internet. every business will either have to adapt or end up like Blockbuster.

### 💡 セクション 101

Um, and if you help businesses implemented, you will never be broke. Do you do you agree on that or where do you see AI? >> Yeah, I think I saw this saw this tweet. I don't know where you posted it. Um, maybe you shared it on Instagram or something.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Yeah, I mean, we we've said the same stuff. It's kind of a core part of of my brand and the message I want to get out there as well is like this stuff if you people are treating it like it's like it's like an NFT trend or something or like a little little like bubble that's just going to like show up and and disappear. I've heard Mark Andrees um compare it to it's essentially like the biggest revolution in computing since the computer like the computer. There was two two routes for computers to be developed and basically this sort of like calculator this thing that can run all these like clear calculations and basically what we have now is just a big big calculator that's running a lot of a lot of processes um like in in milliseconds. But the other direction for computing was the neuronet network was something more based on sort of biological and and and how our human brain works and the brain generally and they knew that like Alan Turing and and the and the OGs in computing they knew that there was these two ways and they're like we think that's going to be probably better given the technology at the time they had to go down this very linear sort of big calculator route and when Mark Andre says that this is like biggest revolution computing since the computer and that we're like exploring this other path I think that goes to show just like I mean how big the the computer, let alone the personal computer was.

### 🎯 セクション 103

I think it's it's ridiculous to say that you've like missed the boat and it's like what we're 3 years 3 years in now basically. I mean, I think people are around the way to get into it. But I think we're we're starting to see so much shape in the market now where there's the education services you can do of just up upskilling companies on how to use [ __ ] chat GBG is like you can build a big business around that. Like start with small like it's it's beyond me that like people have any excuse about getting into this thing at this point. If you know how to use CHBT, you could very easily create a course on how to use it and break it down by department, how marketing, how finance, how operations or how customer support can be using it and then go to small business and teach that.

### 💭 セクション 104

You can now do like AI tools audits and start to offer kind of basic consulting as a pretty much a beginner. You can then try to get into no code development. There's so many things that business need and then like I said, the whole whole planet basically needs this stuff at some point. It's still incredibly untapped and if you go to talk to any small business owner um then then they'll tell you that that they're not doing anything on this. >> Yeah.

### 📌 セクション 105

And then the space is also moving so quickly that the technology I know that I was implementing two years ago is already now outdated. Right. And businesses they move slow. They move really slow. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 106

To go through compliance. Yeah. >> Especially in larger companies. >> The bigger the slower. >> Exactly.

### 📚 セクション 107

So you starting now building the newest technology now in a year's time you will already be replacing the technology that was placed now I know that Albert 3 years ago he uh he chose the right path because if I had chose to go to university I would definitely still be broke and it's the initial like the the start of software engineer jobs that are being taken first by AI right now so I would probably have a hard time getting a job when I get out of uni. I really think that the best two things you can do with your time right now is one AI because of the reason that we just mentioned you want to replace instead of being replaced and knowing this technology will only make you more valuable in society and two if you can create content and be known on the internet then I think that's something that AI will never really replace. I think people will always appreciate that other people are talking to them. And I think that social aspect on social media platforms will stay even when we get AI. >> Maybe the antidote to to AI and content is the is the live streaming stuff we're seeing more and more now.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Um where like people actually want to connect with uh like I've even thought about pulling these pods that we do like over onto a live stream where we people can be watching it live of me and you chatting back and forth. I think if people can figure out how to crack that and use that as a form to like repurpose your short form content, but whether you can create longs out of it, that's what we're really looking to do. Albert, mate, it's been uh been great to great to chat. Thank you for sharing your story. Um I think there's a lot of lot of things people can take away from that, whether it's a software.

### 🎨 セクション 109

Uh, obviously we've got the whole community side that that we could have could have hopped into. But the fact that you've been able to learn all the stuff on the fly as someone with no technical background and and someone who chose to to go down this route instead of the the the traditional route, I think is a is a great testament to to how much opportunities in the space. You're just one of those cases of a dude who just was like very determined and and said, "I'm going to do this." It's a quote that I I love that I heard recently, which is like, "Skeptics sound smart, optimists make money." And I think so many people in the AI space, you will get in your comments on your videos. It's like, oh dude, like this stuff isn't ready or it's like companies are no way going to like I got this stuff when I I I first started talking about like, hey, you could use no code stuff to deliver AI. Like that was whole no code AI for businesses was unheard of when I started talking about it.

### 🚀 セクション 110

And then people like you heard that message and just say, okay, [ __ ] it. Let's let's let's run it. And optimist make money and skeptics are probably still like broke. Like that's that's really how it is. I think being optimistic about the technology is is a surefire way.

### ⚡ セクション 111

and being willing to put in the work as you have um is is a surefire way to be successful, mate. So, I really appreciate all the value you've come in and uh and drop for the community. And if you guys want to get in touch with Albert, check out his his uh socials and his agency and whatnot and also the software. Um I'll link those down in the description and I'm sure he's got some plenty good stuff on his on his socials if you want to learn more about the the software and what it does. >> Just wanted to say I appreciate all you have done for for the entire community.
