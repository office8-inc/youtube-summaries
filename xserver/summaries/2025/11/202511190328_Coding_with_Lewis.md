## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Let's turn a boring task like cleaning and turn it into a futuristic game. I built this game that helped people with ADHD do things around the house. First, let's gamify. So, using Lens Studio, I quickly prototyped a game for the spectacles, which you see on my head here, where it can track your hand and indicate where you have missed. Now, everything is easier, but it's just not stimulating enough.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, let's just add a large percentage sign so that at all times you know how much is left. Game game theory here folks. Let's go into Lens Studio and do that. Now, is it really brain rot enough though if we don't have some sort of like subway surfer somewhere to watch? Maybe a sand video at the same time.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And so using the examples on Lens Studio, I was able to quickly develop this prototype using TypeScript and the available SDKs that you [music] can use for the mobile version of Snapchat and the new spectacles. Modern problems require modern solutions.
