## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

In 2025, I'm on track to generate just under $10 million US online. And for me, in terms of my actual take-home profits, that's well over a million USD. And I've been able to pull this off as a 25-year-old with no degree and no rich dad by using a metric [ __ ] ton of AI tools. In fact, I use so much that OpenAI literally sent my company award to thank us. So, with 2026 right around the corner, I thought I'd put together an exact list of AI tools that I would recommend to someone if they also wanted to make a million dollars or more next year.

### 📋 背景・概要

But, I'm not going to sugar coat it. Making a million dollars in a year is an extremely difficult thing to do. And realistically, 99.9% of you guys watching this video are not going to pull that off in the space of 12 months. But as they say, shoot for the moon and even if you miss, you'll end up among the stars. So, while many of you who watch this video won't hit that $1 million per year mark, many of you will reach 10 to 20k per month.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And this is still a massive win. Like you can quit your job, you can get that new car, you can take the vacation you want, you can go and get those Taylor Swift concert tickets that you've been wanting to get for a long time. You can do whatever with that, right? I don't care what you do. But if you get to that point, it sets you up very, very nicely as a foundation to then go and shoot for that million dollar year in, say, 2027.

### 📝 詳細説明

So either way, you win. So sit back and buckle up cuz this is not going to be your typical AI tools video. I'm going to be giving you basically a step-by-step blueprint to be able to build your dream life with AI that centers around 10 different AI tools. And as a fair warning, there is a bunch of context that I need to explain about the path to get to a million before I start handing out these AI tools. So, if you can't sit through a little like 5 minutes of explanation, then you haven't got a chance in hell at succeeding at this, so I wouldn't even bother.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Anyway, now if you're new to the channel, you may be a little bit skeptical about a broccoli hair looking Gen Z kid promising that you can make a million dollars in 12 months. And good, you should be if you hear that stuff online. But as they say in one of my favorite quotes at the moment, "Skeptics sound smart, optimists make money." So say hypothetically that this video gave you a 30% chance of being able to make a million dollars in the next few years and build your dream life with it. Would it still be worth your time? I know what my answer would be.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So if you're naturally a skeptic, please just give it a little chance. Give it a chance, right? And if you are on the fence, I seriously urge you go back and check the tapes. Look at my channel here. I've got 3 years of me posting videos to show me going from literally an AI noob to making millions of dollars online.

### 🎯 応用例

You'll see me start and build my agency, Mornings.AI, AI from my spare bedroom to working with MBA teams, NRL teams, and publicly traded companies. You can join my 260,000 person community that is based around the method I'm about to teach you. You can listen to the podcast here on this channel where I'm interviewing people who have taken this method and been successful with it. Many of them are now literally the top voices in the AI space right now. And if you want to see behind the scenes of how I'm actually building my AI companies, you can check out my vlog channel, which is in the description as well, where I'm literally showing you day-to-day what it looks like of me running these businesses.

### 💭 考察

So, let's get into it. So, first things first, we need to figure out what this path to a million dollars is. So [music] there's going to be a bunch of different routes. Let's start off with the first things first that it needs to be a business. You're not going to be able to make a million dollars in a year unless you are literally one of the top CEOs for some of the largest companies in the world.

### 📌 まとめ

Has to be starting your own business. Secondly, the business needs to be beginner friendly and easy to start. It needs to be a low barrier to entry. It needs to have a low cost and minimal startup capital because you guys probably don't have 100 grand lying around to invest into the business. It needs to be in a growing industry, which is something that you can really bet long-term on and it's going to be able to ride the wave.

### ✅ 結論

like you don't want to be starting a newspaper business right now if you're going to start something that you're going to be able to stay and focus in for a long time and that you're going to be able to kind of ride the wave of growth where there's a lot more money and there's a higher chance of getting lucky basically. And finally, you're going to want to pick a business model that is proven to work for people in your position. You don't want to be a guinea pig and being kind of tested on and trying something new. You want to pick something that is proven to work for people in your situation and getting good results in a reasonable amount of time. The best option right now that ticks all those boxes is going to be an AI service business that sells either [music] AI education, AI consulting, or AI development in the form of no code or low code tools to small businesses.

### 📚 追加情報

So, you're [music] going to be selling some kind of AI stuff to small businesses. Now, before you freak out and think that's way out of your depth, give me a freaking second here because getting into this thing is seriously accessible to anyone with a fully functioning brain and 10 fingers. Maybe you could probably do it with like eight fingers or six fingers even. So, as a bit of context, if you don't know me and my story, this is how I started in the AI space. That's how I've gotten to the point where I'm making as much money as I said at the start.

### 🔖 補足

I started with my agency, Morning Side AI, and I had no AI experience when I got into it at the start of 2023. And I've been able to grow that business and start a bunch of others over the past 3 years, despite being completely new and kind of in your position when I first started, and things were way harder back then. And I'm recommending this because I know that it has worked for me. It has worked for a ton of my friends. It has worked for thousands and thousands of people who have watched my videos or joined my free and paid communities.

### 🎨 セクション 13

As I said, I interview some of the top people here on this channel if you want to check those out. But this model has proven time and time again to be the best and most reliable way for a complete beginner to get into selling some kind of AI services and making money in the AI space. And if any of those services, AI education or consulting or development sounds scary, then no [ __ ] Like, you are trying to start a business. You're trying to make a million dollars. At some point, you're going to have to learn something, man.

### 🚀 セクション 14

You're going to have to like get thrown in the deep end and figure out how to swim. Like, I've done this over and over and over again in my career. This is entrepreneurship. this is getting dropped in and saying, "Wow, I don't know the first thing about educating companies with AI." Good. Okay, let's learn it.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Let's take this one step at a time. Let's figure it out. And the good thing is for you coming in at this point is that there's been thousands of people who have walked these steps before you and it's just a case of following them now. And luckily for you guys, because I'm such a nice guy and I just so badly want to see you guys succeed, I'm going to break down how to do each of these and make it real crystal clear in a full guide that's going to be associated with this video, which I'll be talking more about as we get a little bit later in the vid. Now, here's where this video is going to get a bit spicy, right?

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, on this channel, I talk facts. >> These are facts, people. >> And if we're talking facts, the reality is that the people who are getting to that million-doll mark the fastest are thinking smart about how they do this, right? They are copying one of the most proven models to online business success. The proven model is learn the thing, do the thing, teach the thing.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Which means that once you stand up a business selling any of these three things, educational, consulting, and development, you look for ways to take those learnings and [music] package them into a much more scalable offer. For example, if you're doing AI consulting, you may be doing AI tools audits where you kind of go into a company, figure out what off-the-shelf tools you can recommend to them. Once you've done 30 of these, you're going to have a pretty good idea of how to run them. And then what you can do is say, hm, well, I could either do like a thousand of these audits, or I could go, hey, here's this DIY guide on how a company can do their own AI tools audit themselves. And so, you take all the learnings and the methodology and the process that you've been doing for your clients, and then you package it up into a course that you sell to businesses.

### 📋 セクション 18

Now, the thing is that you can keep selling the AI tools audit you do yourself, but then if they say, "No, we'll say, "Hey, that's not a good time for us." You can say, "Hey, well, I've got this $297 course. So you can just do it yourself if if my $2,000 or $3,000 price point is too much for you. So it's basically finding a more scalable way of repackaging the thing that you do. Another example, if you're doing AI development with kind of no code low code tools and you're doing say for roofers and you've done maybe 20 client projects for rufus, you go hm I've learned a lot now when it comes to how AI can help roofers. I've tried all these different systems.

### ⭐ セクション 19

There's been a couple that are really really helpful and just generally the approach to where the main problems are that AI can solve. I know that stuff now. So, what if I put together a program like kind of a DIY program for how roofers can approach automating their own business? And so, alongside my high ticket agency services for 10, 20, $30,000 and create a program where roofers can join and watch some course material to kind of understand all this stuff. They might be guided through how to hire their own AI automation engineer either through like your community or maybe you offer a service where you're going to pair them up with a decent AI automation engineer.

### 📝 セクション 20

And then as like the secret source in your program, you can reveal what the best use cases are that you've seen from your clients and you go, "Hey, here's the best use cases. Here's the templates to get started. Here's your AI automation guy. You can go now and do that. And I mean, I'm here.

### 💡 セクション 21

We might do coaching calls every now and then, but you can basically do that on your own. And now, the key here that a lot of people tend to forget is that you got to keep doing the thing. You got to keep doing your agency because this is where the learnings come from. And this is unfortunately where like the whole fake guru comes from. And back in the day when I was just getting into entrepreneurship, it was the fake drop shipping guru who had one store that popped off and then he was using screenshots of that drop shipping store to sell courses for the next 3 years despite not doing any more drop shipping.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And of course, this kind of model is very short-sighted, right? These guys eventually got exposed or they just kind of ran out of source because they weren't learning any new stuff. They weren't able to keep making their more scalable offering more valuable. And so, the whole thing kind of collapses eventually because you've just given them a bunch of outdated information. So, it's important to realize that these two, the two parts of it are essential to helping you get to that million dollars, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

Like they support each other. The learnings from this help you to put better information into the scalable offering, helps you get better results, help you charge more. And then if you do it right, there's actually an interesting thing that happens where the learnings from your students and your clients actually can help inform how you do things in your agency. So there's a really nice feedback loop here which can really help you to scale quickly. And the realization of this is why I still run Morningside AI.

### 💭 セクション 24

My agency is literally bigger than it's ever been. We're signing bigger deals and bigger clients than we ever have before. We're working with publicly traded companies on multi6figure AI deals. [music] We are working with an NBA team, have been for the past year, and now we've just started an entirely new contract with them. That's freaking enormous.

### 📌 セクション 25

And we're also doing some extremely exciting things with a massive rugby league team in Australia as well. And so, as you guys can see, I'm dropping some mega source here, right? I'm putting you on to how the people across all of the people I see doing AI and trying to get in and make money, the patterns that are emerging amongst the people who have the most success. I'm literally giving you the source, myself included. So, this is it.

### ✅ セクション 26

Tune in. I hope you skeptics are starting to be a little bit more optimistic with me here. So, now we need to break down how these 10 AI tools fit into this whole model and path to a million that I've just broken down. Going back to what we said about learn the thing, sell the thing, teach the thing. There's going to be five tools for learn the thing.

### 📚 セクション 27

There's going to be three tools for sell the thing and there's going to be two tools for teacher the thing, right? Getting into phase one, learning the thing. So, as I said, you're going to have to learn something in order to be valuable in order to make some money. I call this a knowledge gap. Basically, if your client knows absolutely nothing at zero out of 100 on knowledge about AI, maybe AI education or like how to spot use cases or how to build AI systems, a lot of them are going to be at zero or maybe 5 or 10.

### 🔖 セクション 28

in order to make any money, you need to make sure that you're just ahead of them by a little bit. It might be you 15 or a 20. And so the whole point of this learning phase is to get yourself some kind of knowledge in any of those three skills. Now, as I said, I'm going to break it down kind of the exact offers and way to do this in the free guide that's going to come with this video. But just keep in mind that yes, there is going to be a learning phase here.

### 🎨 セクション 29

You're going to have to learn some new stuff because that's the information you're going to be selling. And right now in terms of bang for your buck, the easiest and most valuable thing that you can learn in a short amount of time and sell for a decent amount of money is any of those AI services that I've just talked about. Education in terms of training the teams and teaching them what AI actually is. Consulting, which means running an AI audit and figuring out kind of how AI can help your company best and telling them where to go. And then development, which in your case is going to be low code and no code tools, doing AI automation, which you may have seen kind of floating around on the internet these days, which is super accessible to anyone who wants to learn it.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So for these five tools in the learning section, you don't actually have to learn all of them. I just recommend you pick one of them and get really good at it. And then that's going to be sort of where you've got your knowledge and where you can start selling from. So the first one, don't click off the video. Give me a second to bring this home.

### ⚡ セクション 31

But the first one is Chat GBT. The first AI tool you can use to make a million dollars is Chat GBT. And the second one is Claude. Now hear me out. So when you look at the studies of how AI is providing ROI to businesses, [music] these tools, the generic LLM based tools are the lowest hanging fruit in terms of how a company can spend money on AI and get a positive return back.

### 🌟 セクション 32

The offer and the opportunity around this is for you yourself, if you don't already know how to use these tools, is to learn how to use them properly and then make some form of workshop or a course or any kind of educational product. Remember, education, consulting, development, any kind of educational offering where you can go into a company and say, "Hey, I'm going to educate you guys on what AI is and how it can help companies. We sell this at Morningside AI for 8 to $10,000 per workshop. It's like a three-hour workshop." Or you can do things like create courses and sell them to businesses and say, "Look, I'm going to do a survey and I'm going to get all of your your company to fill out this form and and tell me how they're using AI. I'm going to give you an analysis, kind of a report on which departments are using AI and where, who you super users are, who seems to be sort of lagging behind.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Here's an initial analysis of where your team is at in terms of learning these ALM tools. Remember, according to the latest studies, the companies that are adopting these are seeing a positive return on their investment. That's how you can pitch it. And after you do this audit and kind of analysis of the AI education on basic stuff like chatbt and claude, you can say look we are now going to roll out your employees into our introduction to chatbt where you're going to get taught about the basics of this and this and this. Then we're going to break it down by department and then for your marketing team I've got a specific workshop or a specific course that they're going to watch to show how for marketing use cases.

### 📋 セクション 34

They can use chat or claude. You know you've got projects, you've got web searching, you've got MTPs on claude you have claude skills now which is really really powerful. Your whole service might just be going into a business and teaching them how to use Claude and setting up Claude skills which are kind of like workflow prompts that instruct Claude on how to do a whole sequence of steps. There's so much depth in these tools now in value to be created that just learning how to use chat eva properly and then being able to teach small businesses how their teams can also do it is an enormous opportunity and that is why these two are both in here. And as I said that might have sounded a bit complicated but I'm going to be breaking down each one of these tools how I'd create an offer that you can sell as a beginner around it that is going to be available at the end of the video.

### ⭐ セクション 35

tool number three is Lovable or any other kind of AI app builder of your choice. The reason these made the list is because for beginners looking to get into AI, learning how to vibe code software, you can give it all the [ __ ] you want, but it does represent an incredible opportunity for complete beginners to get in and learn how to build software. You're not going to be building massive SAS applications for your clients initially, but there are sort of entry-level offers that you can go and make to clients. Whether it's saying, "Hey, your website looks crap. I rebuilt it.

### 📝 セクション 36

Check this out. It's going to be 300 bucks." And that's your starting point, of course. And you can build beautiful, incredible websites on these things within a few hours. And so if you can do this enough time, you build up your vibe coding skills. You might start to say, "Hey, why don't we put a special feature on it?

### 💡 セクション 37

I'm going to put an AI chatbot on your website." Do you have any internal tools that I can build for you? Hey, I'm going to build a little tool for your team to do this. And you start to gradually expand your skills and and tackle, hey, I'm going to go a little bit outside of what I'm used to doing. I'm going to pick something that's a little bit difficult and I'm going to have to learn some new things. That is literally the process and progression that's going to take you towards being able to land 10, 20, 30, $50,000 projects.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So, as a whole, picking a vibe coding tool and learning how to build software and websites with it and working your way towards more and more valuable projects is an excellent on-ramp AI for beginners. Tool number four is retail, which is an AI voice agent building platform. Retail, Vappy, any other kind of tools that you want to choose, those are the two main ones right now. And now, the reason this is on the list is because AI voice agents are proven to be one of the clearest ways that companies can get an ROI from their spend on AI. Whether it's an AI receptionist that takes calls for them and then could book appointments, whether it's calling out to their list and saying, "Hey, I have a bunch of leads that uh I haven't talked to in a while.

### 🎯 セクション 39

I'm going to call them and ask if they're interested in a new offer." Voice AI has proven time and time again to be one of the best places for a real ROI within small businesses. So, I've broken this down in a bunch of different interviews on the channel with people who are really crushing it right now. So, in the resource that comes with this video, there's going to be links to all of those so you can watch them and really come up to speed on where the best opportunities are in voice AI right now. And finally, tool number five, which is the end of this learn section, is going to be make.com. Now, this is just a great entry point to AI automation.

### 💭 セクション 40

This takes you into more of the development route. And learning make.com and getting an understanding of AI automation has proven to be one of the most reliable ways for a complete beginner with no tech or business experience to get into the AI space to learn the basics of how to build these systems for businesses. I recently did a podcast with a guy from my program, Mckell, and he was able to make $100,000 in his first year in AI automation by learning this tool as a starting point. his story and all the information you need on how to get started in selling these kinds of services is going to be in the free resource with this video. Now, with all the learning out the way and remember you just want to pick one of those tools to get started.

### 📌 セクション 41

Each one of those is a huge opportunity and kind of pathway in itself. But picking one of those and deciding which one is best for you. Maybe an easier one is is chatbt and claude because you feel like you're not going to be very good at the technical side of things. Maybe you want to go to the voice agents because that seems interesting to you. Each of those is a valid path for you to get started as a beginner.

### ✅ セクション 42

With phase two, it's all about selling the thing that you've just learned. So, you've got some kind of skills or experience and you're trying to sell your services. Next, basically, our goal here is to let as many people as possible know that our stuff exists and that we are offering these things for as little effort as possible. Now, this may have one of the ugliest names for an AI tool that I think I've ever come across. I don't know what the hell they were thinking there.

### 📚 セクション 43

BL AI is essentially a cheaper alternative to what I use, which is called Poppy AI. Now, Poppy AI is a AI whiteboarding software, which basically allows you to build a whole bunch of context. You can paste in YouTube videos. You can paste in your own custom text. You can put in videos from Instagram and LinkedIn and things like this.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Basically, you can dump a whole lot of examples of content or custom prompts. And then you get to connect into a chat interface where you can chat away. So, this is essentially your hack. Well, it's my hack as well. I do it for all of my videos and all of my content and even use Poppy like this for tons of other ways.

### 🎨 セクション 45

This allows [music] you to sell the [ __ ] out of your services because it allows you to create content much faster. There's a few different ways you can do this which I'll include in the resource. Basically, you can find people's example videos that are doing well. You can reskin it and sort of respin it to your own. You can dump in a bunch of research and reports and get it to come out with ideas.

### 🚀 セクション 46

There's so many ways you can use this. And this has been a massive unlock for me and how I've been able to be so consistent with content and grow this channel to nearly 700,000 subscribers in in 3 years. Poppy starts off at like $1,000 for a year and you can't buy a monthly. So, if you don't have the funds for that, Blot AI seems like a good alternative. So, that's why I put Blot as as tool number six because I know you guys may not be walking around with $1,000 to spend.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Tool number seven is all about kind of letting people know your stuff exists from a different angle. Content is of course one and that's kind of posting a ton of stuff talking about who you are, what you do, and so on. Another way of letting people know that you exist is through doing some kind of outreach, whether that's warm or cold. In this case, we're talking about cold outreach and cold email specifically, which can be done through a platform called [music] Instantly AI. This has for a long time been the best cold emailing platform out.

### 🌟 セクション 48

And they've added on a ton more AI features that allow you to get a lot more out of it as a solo founder. So, it's going to have autoresponders. You can create your own agents that are basically going to book in meetings with you as soon as someone replies. The instantly AI jumps in and is allowed to go back and forth with emails until they book you in for a meeting. This is incredible for you when you're just getting started because you're going to be able to load up thousands and thousands of emails of people who you're trying to sell to and blast out emails to them and as soon as they reply the instantly AI is there trying to book you in.

### 🎬 セクション 49

This is a great tool for you to be able to start getting more clients. Tool [music] number eight is Gamma. Now, you guys may have heard of this, but it's an AI presentation kind of slide deck tool. And the reason this is so essential in the selling phase is because for your AI services and starting your agency, you're going to need to be putting out a lot of presentations. And early on in my journey, this bogged us down a lot.

### 📋 セクション 50

We would spend a day or two putting together this custom proposal and then we'd send it to a client and hear nothing back from them. So, in order to save time, you really need to find a way to compress that presentation creation process down to just like 30 minutes or an hour. And with something like Gamma, you can use AI to take your call transcript from the discovery call you did with your client. You can even automate the whole process by taking that transcript and getting it to generate a full proposal for you ready to check and tweak as you need to. But compressing that down, the more proposals you get out, the more clients you're going to sign.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So, it's essential that you think about ways to compress that down and make it faster to deliver them. Right? So, that's phase two, selling the thing. Now we get into the final stage which is taking all of that agency and sort of the success you've had there and turning it into your more scalable offering whatever form that is whether it's just a course or whether it's program or a coaching or mentorship or whatever it is. This phase of course is something you can only execute on once you've got some learnings and real source to take from this and your content will have to be performing purely well.

### 📝 セクション 52

So you do the thing then you start talking about the thing on content that helps you get more clients and then from that you get some learnings which allows you to create some kind of more scalable offering. Remember that we're doing this because it is a proven pattern. learn the thing, do the thing, teach a thing. Once you get in that do the thing, teach a thing loop, you can make a [ __ ] ton of money. And the first one is school, which doesn't really count because it's not an AI tool.

### 💡 セクション 53

But when you have a school community, which I recommend you do a free one, and you add on top of it fiducia, which is an AI tool that's actually created by some people who added my community a while ago, you have a very lightweight stack to create and manage your own community, even as like a solo founder. It's just one person. And the reason is because Fiducia is a super powerful tool that sort of sits on top of school and allows you to have much more analytics and and tools and features such as AI moderation where you can set different settings of like what posts you want to automatically delete or flag. You have ways to manage your inbox and do appointment setting with the people in there. So creating a free community where you can send people from your content, you can teach them the basics about it and then you can upsell them either to your agency services or you can upsell them to some kind of education product or put your course in the in the school courses as well.

### 🔧 セクション 54

But having this free community where you can send people, give a ton of free value, and then sell them either into your agency services or to kind of a DIY program like we mentioned is a really, really powerful strategy that has been proven time and time again to get results. And I know this stuff gets a real bad rap. Like anytime it's like selling like a course or community, it just has a bad rap. But you can do it right, guys. You can do it right.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So don't hate on it. Just do it right. Actually give value. Actually do your agency and pass the learnings into it. You can do this right.

### 💭 セクション 56

So before you hate on it, before you dismiss it and think, "Oh, I'm above that." just really think about I can do this right. I can help a lot of people. I can make a lot of money through my program and through my agency as well. And finally, we're going to wrap things up with a tool that's really really helpful for course content creation, which is going to be Hen. So, you can create and film like this and [music] film a bunch of clips and upload it to Hen and it's going to create a AI avatar of you.
