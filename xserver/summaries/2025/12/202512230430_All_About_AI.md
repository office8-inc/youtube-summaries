## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, let's say we're going to mask her lips here. Something like that. And we just say uh blue lipstick. Generate. And now this should be very quick because we optimized for this being like efficient.

### 📋 背景・概要

And let's see what we get here. Yeah, you get it. And then you can continue working on this. And yeah, that is just one uh example of something you can do. Okay.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, today uh I wanted to talk a bit about how I plan to use AI in 2026, the upcoming year, right? I have a couple of examples of like yeah examples of what I mean and stuff but basically it's just going to be a pretty chill video. I'm just going to talk a bit about this show you a couple of examples and yeah that's about it I think. So here are kind of the four points I have picked out so far I want to focus on in 26 using uh AI and scaling automation is something I want to do more of. Uh, I'm going to show you one simple example of an automation pipeline you can set up.

### 📝 詳細説明

And I also want to focus more on like AB microAI businesses. Uh, the video I did yesterday, you can go check that out if you want to know more more about kind of my micro AI businesses. I definitely want to dive more into that. And there are bunch of opportunities in this new generative AI media space, right? Uh, I also have an example.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Yeah, I guess maybe you saw it in the intro of something simple you can do. This is always opportunities going to be there next year I think. Uh but the main point for me is just going to be keep learning and keep winning I guess because if you stay ahead of this technology there's just so much you can do now. Uh if you just put a bit of effort in you don't have to do it like I do. Maybe you can spend like 30 minutes each day or something just learning about the new tools.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

See what you can do. Maybe a small adjustment in your workflows and stuff like that. And yeah, that basically is the four things I want to do. Most heavily it's going to be on like scaling automation. Uh, and I think kind of the micro businesses is also something I want to focus on and of course keep learning as always, right?

### 🎯 応用例

So, let me just start by showing you an example of a simple automation pipeline you can set up now that works yeah uh reliably. Okay, so this is kind of the simple automated pipeline I want to show you. Uh, it could be super super easy. Let's say we wanted to just grab something off the web, right? So, we are using Gemini 3 flash and like to say the Google grounding API.

### 💭 考察

Uh we just want to search for a set term. This could be AI news. We're just going to scrape those URLs, gathered some context. We also use Gemini 3 Flash again to extract uh the headlines, the content, put it into nice format, and just save it in a database. For our case, it's just going to be super base.

### 📌 まとめ

And for that, we can use GitHub actions, and that could be a chron job. So this triggers every morning um yeah at 9 or something. So this could be like a standalone pipeline or it could be a part of a bigger pipeline right that is how you got to think right so let me show you kind of an example basically show you how this works. So I kind of have my code here, right? As you can see, I have something called GitHub workflow.

### ✅ 結論

And I have a headlines.jaml file here. This is kind of my GitHub actions. And you can see I have all the code and stuff here. But of course, I pushed this to GitHub. So if I head over here, we have something called actions, right?

### 📚 追加情報

Under actions here. And we have my headline aggregator. Okay. And you can see if we check the database now. Uh yeah, we have some stuff here.

### 🔖 補足

So this for my testing. Let's just delete all this. Okay. So we got a clean database. And if we run this now, so let's say this workflow runs every hour, right?

### 🎨 セクション 13

Or something like that. So I can click run workflow. Okay. And you can see if you go in here now, this is already set up. I put in my my API keys and stuff and everything.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And this should be run right autonomous now. So this is just a part of something you can do, right? We install all the narpm install. We do the mpm start. We're searching yeah today searching trading headlines and you can see we are using we found some headlines using Google grounding and we're going to try to scrape them.

### ⚡ セクション 15

We scrape three pages. We're not going to get everything. This is just an example of a pipeline you can do right and everything goes to this. We are extracting the stories and the whole point of this is that we're going to save it somewhere. Right?

### 🌟 セクション 16

So it's automated. It's not something I have to go and do. I just get the results. Right. So, let's just let this run and then we can check the database.

### 🎬 セクション 17

It shouldn't take long, right? Okay. So, you can see we got all the headlines here. Here are all the stories, right? We can scroll down.

### 📋 セクション 18

We got some politics. We got some world news, politics, science. Okay. And if you go to my database now, boom, we got it. Right.

### ⭐ セクション 19

We have the categories. So you can check sports, something about sports, something about sports, business, Google and Apple advise USA via solders to avoid overseas travel. Yeah, you get the point. So the idea is that this is autonomous, right? And this is something I want to do more of in um uh in 2026.

### 📝 セクション 20

I said I was going to give you like an example of like opportunities in generative AI media and stuff. So uh I prepared like a simple example. I've done a bunch of this on the channel if you want to see more, but uh yeah, let's just do it. So, if you head to cursor, uh I wanted to try out this new, it's called said image turbo inpaint model. I love this set image.

### 💡 セクション 21

It's cheap, it's fast, right? So, it's good for doing the simple apps. So, uh what I went ahead and did, of course, with claw code. Let's do mpm rundev, I guess. Uh let's uh no uh let's do an external browser.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Okay. So I kind of showed you this in the beginning. So basically it's an image editor, right? So we can upload an image. Let me just find an image here.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So in in the intro here, I think we just did like blue lipstick. Let's try something else now. Let's just take out the mouth and let's do black lipstick something. Okay. So let's do that.

### 💭 セクション 24

and using this said image editor uh with the API. It's super fast because it's this turbo turbo model. Yeah, that worked. And we can try to do something with this eyes makeup here. Eye makeup.

### 📌 セクション 25

I'm just going to blur out the whole eyes. I don't care. Let's do Yeah, I don't know what kind of makeup people use here, but uh let's do red shadow. Red eye shadow. Okay, let's see what happens.

### ✅ セクション 26

But basically the idea is that this should be like a standard on simple app and you can do editing using generative AI instead of like yeah uh yeah okay that works I guess. So you can see super easy but pretty cool and the user experience with the pace of this is very good and it's just going to get better right that is the idea let's say you run this like locally on like more powerful GPUs you can do this very fast so yeah another just example of opportunities in generative AI basically the point today was just to talk a bit about what I plan to use in 2026 what I want to do more automation more standalone pipelines multiple pipelines parallel pipelines claw code more agentic I want to do more AI micro businesses. See what works, what doesn't work. AB testing, right? I want to do more opportunities in the generative AI media space like we watched in the example video maybe or something like that.

### 📚 セクション 27

Maybe avatars, I don't know. But basically, keep learning and yeah, keep being on the front of this uh I I think it's going to be important, right? And you [snorts] don't have to do this, right? But if you kind of want that small edge, I think at least if you are alone like like me, I have like my own thing. Uh I get like massive benefits from using tools like this.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Uh but if you have like a big team, maybe you have some better workflows at the moment, but that could change in the upcoming years. [music] So yeah, just wanted to talk a bit about this today and share a bit what I plan to do next year. And I'm going to try to cover it on the channel, but I'm going to talk a bit more about in a week about this channel and what I'm going to do next year. I think so. Yeah.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Thank you for tuning in today and I'll see you again tomorrow.
