## 💡 概要

この動画では、OpenRouter APIを使って複数のAIモデル（Claude、Gemini、GPT、Grok）を1つのグループチャットに参加させるアプリを構築します。各モデルが互いにメンション（@機能）して会話し、ユーザーのメッセージに応答する様子を実演。OpenAIのコードレッド宣言についての議論では、各AIが異なる視点から意見を述べ、活発な討論が展開されました。AI開発者やAI技術に興味がある方向けの、ユニークで実験的なプロジェクトです。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **OpenRouter API活用**: 400以上のモデルにアクセス可能なOpenRouterを使用し、Claude Haiku 4.5、Gemini 3、Kim K2、Grok 4.1 Fastを同時起動
- **@メンション機能**: ユーザーや他のAIモデルを「@モデル名」で指定して会話。特定のモデルに質問したり、モデル間で意見を交換させることが可能
- **自律的な会話**: モデルが互いに応答し合い、ユーザーの介入なしで討論が展開。停止ボタンで制御可能
- **実験結果**: OpenAIのコードレッド宣言について、各AIが「パラダイムシフト」「ゼロサムゲームではない」「ミームロード」など、異なる視点で議論を展開
- **停止機能の追加**: 初期バージョンでは会話が止まらず、Claude Codeで停止ボタンを追加。同じモデルが連続で応答しないよう改善

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Let's see if all models respond now. So Grock was pretty fast. What's good with you? Kimmy Gemini. So we tagged all.

### 📋 背景・概要

Anything fun planned? Nothing wild, just vibing in the chat. They mention my troll. Today we're going to do something a lot of people have asked me about, but I haven't really done a video on it. So I thought we can do it today.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh they wanted to know if we can do like a group chat of different models. So uh this is what we're going to do today. We're going to Yeah, you can pick different models. We're going to use open router API because they have all the models, right? So that's a super way to do this.

### 📝 詳細説明

So this is going to be our API hub. And let's say you can select different models. We pick claude, Gemini, GPT, and we put them in like a group chat interface. So let's say you put in a message. So one of the models can respond.

### 💡 実例・デモ

They can respond to each other and stuff like that. So basically, you just get like a big group chat with the models you want. super easy, straightforward application, but pretty fun as you will see. And we're just going to see the messages. I also kind of want to see if we can uh make the models to come up with their own topics.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

We'll see. But yeah, let's do it. So, if you're not familiar with Open Router, go check them out. Open router.ai. Not a sponsor or anything like that, but just there's just a great way to interact with multiple models, and they have a really good selection of models.

### 🎯 応用例

I think they have over 400 or something. So, you have a lot to pick from. Uh but for our uh application today, uh I went to open route to the documentation and I just grabbed kind of the quick start and how to select the models and stuff like that. We don't basically need anything else than that. So, I just copy this quick start page.

### 💭 考察

I created like a docs here. Open router.mmarkdown. I pasted in all the documentation I think we need for this project. got my uh API key in my env. And yeah, basically we are ready to head over to claude.

### 📌 まとめ

So yeah, let's just head over here. Let's do claude and I think I want to start with uh reading the documentation here. Read docs and again I have um described my app with a text to speech. So uh I'm not going to read it out again just takes too long. So, basically what you can do, I'm going to paste in my my text to speech here of kind of the ID of the group chat and I'm just going to head to plan mode.

### ✅ 結論

Okay, going to send this. So, if you want to see what kind of prompt I did, you can just pause the video here and read it. And now we're just going to wait for Opus 4.5 to generate the plan. Take a quick look at it and let's start building this. Okay, so you can see we have the plan now.

### 📚 追加情報

So basically it's pretty straightforward to be honest. So we have uh we have some API roots, we have some type, we have some core components, the chat container, the message list, right? Uh the logic is models respond to user messages, questions, mentions, and random chance or random chance. Uh I also wanted to see if they user messages. Uh let's see if we can get them to respond to other models messages too.

### 🔖 補足

I forgot that. Let's do also make models response to the other LLM messages with the at tag feature. So let's update the plan to that. Okay. So now you can see we have the format at model name Kimmy Claude Gemini Grock.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Okay. And our sample model is going to be Kim K2, Gemini 3, Claude Haiku 45, and Grock 4.1 fast. And if you wanted to, we can add other models, but just for the test here now, I think this is fine. So yeah, I think we're just going to go for it. and I will take you back when this is uh hopefully completed.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Maybe do some iterations and yeah, let's test it out. Okay, so I just wanted to take you back and see kind of how cloud code with Opus 4. Kind of works through some issues we have. You can see it's doing this testing by running the server at uh itself, right? So you can see okay, we found out oh we have an issue here.

### ⚡ セクション 15

We need to put in the the default models here and now we can run some more testing. We are doing some curls to the local host where we are running this. All four models are now showing Kimmy, Gemini, Claude, Grock. Let's clean up the unused code and yeah, it's just super nice to work with cloud code and the latest version of Opus 4.5. It's also very uh nonverbose, so it kind of saves some tokens and stuff like that.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Uh but I think we're ready to test it now. So yeah, let's do it. So you can see uh we can open local host. This is running in the background now. That's great.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, let's just grab this local host here and let's try to open this here. Okay, nice. You can see we have our models here in this chat. No models active. So, we can select them.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, let's do all just for fun. We can have a we have a clear chat button. And okay, I kind of like this layout. Looks pretty good. So, uh I prepared like a message here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Uh, OpenAI declares code red and there's like a short short T uh DLR here. So, let's just copy this and I ask at the end here, what do you guys think? So, let's see how this works now. So, I'm just going to mention it in here and let's see what happens. So, Kim K2 is going to response going to respond.

### 📝 セクション 20

Okay, so let's just wait a bit. Whoa, this really took off. Uh Kimmy says, "This feels like uh this feels like OpenAI's Google Plus moment. Scrambling to respond to the paradigm shift." And Claude, okay, so they are talking to each other. That's pretty cool.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, how do I stop it? I didn't think of that, but they are talking to each other autonomously. That was kind of what I wanted. But I think we need a way to stop this yo group Ashley here. I don't know what's happening, but we need a way to stop this.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, I'm just going to refresh and let's head back to Claude and let's just do Okay, that was pretty good. Uh, I like this. Uh, we need a way to stop the chat. Uh, so we can stop and read it. So, let's just add a stop button where all the calls to the API will stop.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, let's just do that. Okay. So, I think we have fixed this now. Uh, I also made some small changes. So, now the same model can only respond once in a row and a few other changes with at mention.

### 💭 セクション 24

So, let's try it out now. Uh, I want to still do kind of the same um, let's refresh this. And I still want to do the same message, I think. So, let's just grab this, but this time I want to try to do a tag here. And I'm going to do what do you and I'm going to say at Claude think.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, let's see now if that works. Yeah, we do tag Claude here. So, let's see if Claude responds first. Now we did select Kim K2 and Claude Haiku and yeah responded to Claude. Okay, so Kim K2 also comes in here.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh it tags Claude. So it responded to the Claude uh responds to our post here and they are actually talking about the code red memo. That's pretty cool. Holy We might actually lose is the seismic in seismic valley terms. And it tags Claude.

### 📚 セクション 27

And it does follow up here. What am I missing? Maybe I can try in. I'm going to chime in. Do you guys think Google will win the AI race?

### 🔖 セクション 28

And I want to see who responds now. Is it going to be Claude or Kimmy? So Kimmy respond at Claude. I don't know why it's responding to at Claude, honestly. Goog playing the long game.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Beautiful here. They waited and now Claude is going to drive in. I pushed back a bit on win. The AI race isn't zeroome like the browser wars were. So yeah, I guess it's working.

### 🚀 セクション 30

It's pretty cool. So let's try to do one run with all the models. And I'm just going to do this. And I'm going to select all. And I'm just going to say, "Hey guys, what's up?" Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, let's see if all models respond now. So, Grock was pretty fast. What's good with you, Kimmy? Gemini. So, it tagged all anything fun planned.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Nothing wild. Just wing in a chat dimension. Might troll a claude later. So, you can see they are talking to each other now. and you can just follow along with this.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So yeah, pretty much what I wanted. Instant meme lord supremacy turning any conversation into viral gold and they are having a group chat. So I guess we made it. So I guess if you wanted to you can just stick around here and just watch what they are talking about and you can intervene by saying something to Kimmy. What is a meme lord?

### 📋 セクション 34

Uh, and you can tag at@kimmy. So, what is a meme lord atkimmy user? It tagged me. Nice. Okay, so it said that to me to a meme lord.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Every photo headline, a random tweet is a raw or they can smelt into 24 charact. Also, Grock answered this. Meme lord equal internet supreme ruler of reaction. Uh, viral edits. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 36

Okay. So, yeah, our group chat is up and running. Uh, I'm going to put this code up on uh, GitHub here. So, I'm just going to leave the link in the description if you want to try it out. So, yeah, thank you for tuning in today.

### 💡 セクション 37

Hope this gave you some inspiration of what you can do with different models. And yeah, enjoy your
