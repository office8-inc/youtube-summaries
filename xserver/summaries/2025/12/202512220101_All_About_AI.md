## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Today, uh, I want to talk a bit about, uh, microAI businesses. Uh, this is going to be something I'm going to focus a lot more on in 2026. Uh, I'm just having a really great year on this and this is something I came up with. I know I haven't shared anything on the channel, uh, but it's just been working very good, right? So, basically, how I do this, I'm just going to go through kind of set my Yeah, this is kind of my internal rules I have for this.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, it's always going to be fast-paced because you need to grow fast to like a moderate level. You don't want to go too high. So, you want to kind of leave growth potential there uh in anything you do. I have some examples later. I'm going to show you how I've been doing it.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, it's kind of low risk, high reward because you figure out fairly quickly if this is going to work or not, and then you just ditch it. I I know I put it down here, but uh I said no sunken cost fallacy because you don't want to have anything of that. If it's not working after like a week or so, I'm just ditching it, right? And I always develop multiple at the same time. And a very important point is if something is working, just double down very hard on it because you got to be ruthless.

### 📝 詳細説明

Like you can't really think uh I don't want to use AI in this. This is too unethical. Uh I want to support artist and stuff like that. But you're just going to be left behind, right? because everyone else is using it if you are not playing on the same level as them.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Yeah, I guess it could work. But basically, you just got to be ruthless because it's a hard it's a tough competition out there and you got to be ruthless if you want to do something at least that matters to you. Uh if you just want to have fun and like share it with your friends and stuff, yeah, go for it. But if you want to make some money, have it like a small business thing, side hustle, you got to be ruthless. So I just want to first show you a couple of examples of businesses I have been doing in 25 and yeah just share some.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So one thing that has been working pretty good for me this year is like this micro YouTube channel flips. So uh it doesn't it sounds kind of advanced but it's really not right. So basically here is kind of my setup. So I want to try to grow a channel to monetization and leave it there for one month. Okay just to find the revenue potential because this matters from different channels.

### 🎯 応用例

If it's like finance, it's much higher. If it's gaming, it's pretty low, right? And you just want to record one month of revenue. If you get to monetization, find a buyer and I try to flip it for like 20x multiple. So, for example, if the first channel low, yeah, makes $200.

### 💭 考察

That's pretty good. Sometimes it's just 50 or something like that. And let's say you do 200, that's good. And then you uh Yeah. can flip it for like 20x.

### 📌 まとめ

That's 4K, right? So, it's it sounds very daunting, right? But if you kind of get into this space and you kind of know what to look for and stuff like that, with the AI tools we have, cloud code, everything, right, it's not that hard. And again, it comes back to being ruthless. It's not the most ethical thing you can do, but uh yeah, you just got to fight out there.

### ✅ 結論

Uh I'm going to show you kind of yeah, just a simple example of something I have in progress. Now, I'm not going to go into it. I'm just going to show you like a quick snapshot. But first, a quick word from today's sponsor, and that's going to be me. If you want to dive deeper into AI videos and stuff and generate passive income like I'm talking about in this video, you should definitely go check out my AI course platform, AI video course platform, the AI videocourse.com.

### 📚 追加情報

So, I just updated uh the course platform or the course module that is going to be the AI selfie autonomous workflow. And this is something that has been very good for me in 2025. And yeah, as you will see soon in this main video, how I use this to yeah, make a bunch of revenue. Like not not insane, but like a big chunk of revenue. So if you want to check this out, you can see we have a bunch of other content here too, different modules.

### 🔖 補足

Uh if you buy it once, you keep you get all the the updates for free. So every new module is included. So it's no subscription. It's just a one-time thing, right? So go check it out.

### 🎨 セクション 13

link in the description. Let's go back to the video. Okay, so I had CHP create this for me, but basically what I wanted to say was that so let's say I wanted to do $200 a month. That would be 20 million views if like a low uh RPM. If it's high, it's only three million views.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And that's not that sounds insane, but on shorts, it's not that hard if you find something that works. So like 5 million is like, yeah, you could do that. That's $200 per month, right? Uh so let me show you like an example of something, a project I have. Now, I'm going to blur something out here just because yeah, don't want to share the niche, right?

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, let's say this video here. So, you can see in the last uh 48 hours, this has 230,000 views. Okay? And yeah, it's just been 3 days. So, this video alone could get like a couple of million of views if the continues like this.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And if this video only has a couple of million views, then we only need like a few more, right? So, it's not impossible. It sounds very hard, but if you get into it, it's not that hard, I think. And anyone that kind of puts their mind into this could do it. So, yeah, there's definitely a lot of potential on this, but like I said before, you have to be ruthless.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And yeah, uh it's hard competition. And kind of the second part, I've been having some success with, not to the same monetization levels, but uh pretty good, I would guess. Um but this takes a bit more maybe not skill, I guess. Uh but basically the idea is that you create a hyper specific task uh web app. Okay?

### 📋 セクション 18

So it's only going to do one thing, right? So you need to find like a task that solves one problem. Don't be too complicated because you only want the people you don't want like any data storage or login or like simple things. You don't want to have like a maintainable site. You want to be super easy so you can scale it, right?

### ⭐ セクション 19

So you need one task that solves a problem. That is the only thing you have. So create the most simple effective solution and you need to think about hosting and ongoing cost because if you don't do that your margins will just disappear. Sometimes you have to put ads up. I don't like it but that's just the way it is.

### 📝 セクション 20

But I also put in like a tip jar and that works sometimes. So like Stripe easy to just tip someone if they like your service. So I'm pretty I don't want to have any login. I don't want to store any like passwords, data and stuff like that. So I just try to skip that.

### 💡 セクション 21

And yeah, it's been making some money. So I I want to show you like an example of like this hyper specific task you could do. Uh but this is a bit more sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And here you got to be like, nope, this is not working. Let's just get rid of it.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Right? So let me show you an example of what this could be. Okay. So I went to close code. I said I need one specific versel page, landing page, one page here that solves one problem.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So this is just going to use uh ffmpeg and whisper to the user can upload a video. We extract the MP3. We transcribe it to get timestamps and the solved is to get captions on the video. That's a very that problem is a bit solved. But you kind of get the idea.

### 💭 セクション 24

We have one page. This is the only thing it does. There's no login. There's nothing like that. We put up some ads.

### 📌 セクション 25

We have some tip jars. And basically that that's it. We put it online. we have somewhere to host FFmpeg and Whisper and it's just running right with some limitations. You can only upload a 20 megabyte file or something like that, right?

### ✅ セクション 26

So, uh this should be done soon, I think. Let's build this and let's test it out. This is just local an example, right, of something we could do. So, let's do mpm rundev and let's open up this now. Uh no, we want to do external.

### 📚 セクション 27

Okay, so this is it. Video caption generator. So here we can put up like ads and stuff. We can have like a tip jar. Thanks for using my service.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Add a $1 tip to help me keep this up or something like that. Most people never use it, but let's say you have thousand people. Maybe like 10 do it and you get like yeah 20 bucks or something. So let's upload a video here. So I'm just going to grab something here.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Let's just do I don't know. Let's just pick this one. This is a twominute clip I did earlier. You can see extracting, transcribing, and hopefully we get the timestamps and hopefully we get like the captions burned in. So, I'm just going to let this run and I'm going to show you if this service works or not now.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Okay, so we got the download video. So, I'm just going to try that out. And remember, I don't know if this is going to work. Okay, so we do have the clip here and you can see the captions are too big, right? We didn't make any adjustments on the example.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Uh, but let's hear if this works. Now, I'm just going to play it. Uh, let's hear if it works. So, basically how I do this, I'm just going to go through kind of set my Yeah, this is kind of my internal rules I have for this. So, it's always going to be fastpaced because you need to grow fast to like a moderate level.

### 🌟 セクション 32

You don't Yeah, that was working, right? Not bad. Not bad. So, that is like an example of like a simple tool you can set up. Uh, but of course, you need to know a bit about hosting and stuff like that.

### 🎬 セクション 33

But yeah, that is one example of a specific task you can solve for a problem that many people want to have solved, I guess. So yeah, that is basically it. So the tools I have been using this year for this is Cloud Code, Cloud Code, Cloud Code, uh, Nano Banana Pro, and basically all the AI tools that save me time. But for me, having like an agentic coder like Cloud Code means I can do things in parallel. I can test out, I can rapid improve.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, for me, the $200 subscription is like a no-brainer. But, of course, you need some ways to set this up because I do video editing Cloud Code. I create videos. I create transcripts. Everything I do on Cloud Code, other only use it for coding, right?

### ⭐ セクション 35

I do it for a lot of other things, too. Uh, but there are a bunch of other tools I have used. But maybe in a future video, I share more about that. But, uh, basically, this is something I'm going to do more of in 2026. I'm going to try to scale it up a bit.

### 📝 セクション 36

And yeah, I don't want to talk about how much revenue I made this year. uh doing my micro businesses, but it's a big chunk of money uh if you ask me. Like for me at least, and if you want to do a side hustle, I think this is something you could succeed with. But again, I want to come back to you got to be ruthless. You can't be Yeah, I don't I don't want to talk about it, but basically, you got to be ruthless and you got to be you got to be using all the latest technology because if you don't use it, others will and you will just get left behind, right?

### 💡 セクション 37

So yeah, that is what I wanted to share today and I probably going to do some more videos on this in 2026. If you want to follow along, give this video a like, subscribe, and you will learn more about this. Maybe I'll do a course or something on my course platform. We'll see. But yeah, thank you for tuning in and don't forget to check out the link to the video course in the description if you want to learn to make videos like I do.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So yeah, thank you for tuning
