## 💡 概要

この動画では、映画やドラマのシーンをAIで自由に書き換えるアプリを構築します。好きな動画をアップロードし、特定のフレームを選択してプロンプトを入力すると、Kling 2.6 Image-to-Videoモデルが新しいシーンを生成。FFmpegで元の映像とシームレスに結合し、オリジナル版とAI生成版を比較できます。Breaking BadやAmerican Psychoなど実際の映像で実験し、キャラクターにバックフリップさせたり、予想外の展開を作り出す、パーソナライズドコンテンツの未来を体験できるプロジェクトです。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **Kling 2.6 Pro活用**: fal.aiのImage-to-Videoモデルを使用し、静止画像から5秒の動画を生成。映画シーンの続きを創造的に展開
- **シームレスな結合**: FFmpegで元の映像とAI生成シーンを正確に結合。音声も含めて自然な流れを実現
- **実験結果**: Breaking Badのシーンでウォルターがバックフリップして逃げる展開や、American PsychoでPatrick Batemanが斧を持つシーンなど、成功例と課題の両方を実演
- **プロンプトの重要性**: 「guy in the raincoat」など具体的な記述で精度が向上。キャラクターや動作を明確に指定することが成功の鍵
- **パーソナライズドコンテンツの可能性**: 将来的に視聴者が自分好みにストーリーを変更できる時代の到来を示唆する革新的な技術

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I got to say, I don't like the way you're looking at me right now. New day and new application I wanted to share. So, basically today I wanted to do like a scene changer workflow or the application is that uh you can upload a movie clip. This could be like a scene from your favorite series, movie, whatever. And I wanted to see if we can do like uh uh something with the cling 2.6 image to video model.

### 📋 背景・概要

So basically what I want the application to be is that uh from your scene you just select a place in your clip where you want to stop the or take the frame from there and then you can do like a prompt make the character do a back flip right and we select the frame here and then we use ffmpeg to extract this frame. Right? You can see that over here we use cling 2.6 to generate a new scene based on the input here. And then we get like this backflip scene. Okay.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And then we use ffmpeg again to stitch the video in to the place where we kind of cut off the frame here. And we of course have the prompt that is added to the video and that is of course generated up here. So what we end up is is like uh the original clip up to the point where we selected our frame or our yeah cut and then we stitch in the new frame or the new clip, right? So we get like a seamless uh interaction between the original clip and the generated clip and I want to see how good that looks when we kind of put everything together. So yeah, let's just build it using cloud code uh Opus 4.5 and hopefully this is going to be cool.

### 📝 詳細説明

So for this application, we're going to using fal.ai. And uh what I need to do is start by getting some documentation about the cling video 2.6 Pro imagetovideo model. And over here on file, we can just go to API. And they had all the documentation here. So yeah, uh I think I'm just going to use JavaScript for this.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So I'm going to select that and I'm just going to copy the full documentation here. Yeah, there's no way to fast copy this. So, I'm just going to grab the documentation, head over to cursor in my docs. I'm just going to call it cling 26 uh domarkdown or something like that. And yeah, that is basically all the documentation I think we need to gather for this.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And now we're just going to head over to Yeah, that was the last thing we did. So, we're just going to head over to cloud code. And let's just do uh what did I call this? Uh I can't remember. Uh I called it something like scene.

### 🎯 応用例

Okay. Scene clear cloth. And let's just go in here. And we can just start by something uh read at docs. Uh okay.

### 💭 考察

So let's just do that. And the next part is going to be of course to describe our application and then we're going to try to build it. So I'm just going to do my text to speech now. I'm going to describe the application you saw in the intro uh just with my own words. Uh I like to skip this in the video because it takes like 3 minutes.

### 📌 まとめ

It's quite boring to hear. So yeah. Uh I'm in plan mode, right? I'm just going to describe this and let's start building out the plan here. And if you want to, you can just pause here and read the prompt if you want to.

### ✅ 結論

But now we are starting to uh like yesterday create the the plan. So if you watched a few more videos of my shipment series, you will know what's going to happen now. We're going to generate the plan and we're going to start working on the plan. So uh yeah, I'm just going to skip ahead a bit now and take you back when we have the plan. Okay, perfect.

### 📚 追加情報

So we have the plan now. This is the scene changer implementation plan. I kind of read through this and I think it looks pretty good. We got the layout here. Everything uh setup, frame selections, AI generation, stitching, comparison, and polish.

### 🔖 補足

And yeah, I think that looks pretty good. So yeah, I think we're just going to run this and hopefully we get something back that is uh working. Okay, so now I'm just going to compare prepare my movie scenes. I want to test it out. But uh yeah, hopefully this works.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Okay, so now you can see we have the app runner at uh running at localhost 3000. I went over here and here is the app, right? We have the scene changer. We can upload a video. So let's just do that.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I prepared like a Breaking Bad clip here. So this is just a scene from the series Breaking Bad and let's see what we can do with this now. So the first thing we want to do is Yeah, you can see it here. We can select a frame and we can capture that frame. Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So yeah, let's just uh let's just grab our frame here. Let's do 11 seconds. Walter looking like this. Okay, so we're going to capture that. And now you see we need to configure our scene.

### 🌟 セクション 16

We have the frame. We're going to describe my new scene. Yes. And then we're going to select a clip here. So let me just come up with a prompt here.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So let's just do Walter turns around, slams through the garage port, and runs away. 5 seconds. Generate scene. And yeah, so now we're just going to create this. We're going to generate a clip.

### 📋 セクション 18

We're going to stitch it together and then we can watch the both. So I also added audio to this clip. I don't know how well that's going to turn out, but let's see. That was pretty quick. That didn't take too long.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So now you can see we have the modified player here. Yeah, that's 1 second shorter. We have the original scene. So let me just play you the original clip first and then we can see the transformed clip or the AI modified clip. you okay?

### 📝 セクション 20

I got to say, I don't like the way you're looking at me right now. Yeah. So, that is the scene where uh Hank finds out about Walt or something, confronts him. Uh so, now let's see how our modified AI generated scene ended up. you okay?

### 💡 セクション 21

I got to say I don't like the way you're looking at me right now. Okay, not bad. Not bad. He did actually burst just through the wall here. So, you can see uh I don't know if he can do this.

### 🔧 セクション 22

No, we can't. But basically, we got a new scene. He turned around. He was not hit. He just ran away.

### 🎯 セクション 23

[laughter] Okay, pretty cool. Uh, I want to do one more just for the sake of the video. So, I went ahead. I found another clip I want to try. So, this is a scene from American Psycho.

### 💭 セクション 24

This is Patrick Baitman. So, let's just play the original clip right away before we do any changes. >> No, Helen. >> Is that a raincoat? >> Yes, it is.

### 📌 セクション 25

In ' 87, Huie released this or their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is Pip Square. So, I forgot to put my audio back on, but basically I just gave it the prompt. Patrick Baitman picks up an axe and yeah, smashes the living room. So, I did it after like 3 seconds.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh, I guess I could show you here where I grabbed the frame. I think I grabbed the frame somewhere like here. And I said Patrick Baitman picks up an axe and smashes uh a wall or something. So, let's see how this turned out. >> No.

### 📚 セクション 27

Is that a raincoat? >> Yes, it is. [snorts] >> Okay. I wouldn't say that was exactly what I was looking for. Maybe we need to do a better instruction.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Let's say the the guy in the raincoat in the back or something. Let's try that. Let's just do the frame here. 3 seconds. Uh let me come up with a different prompt.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Patrick Baitman, guy in the raincoat at the back picks up an ax and smashes the wall. Okay, so let's try that again. 5 seconds. Okay. So, we have the generated video.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You can see it's 8 seconds. Perfect. Uh, let's watch it. >> No. Helen, >> is that a raincoat?

### ⚡ セクション 31

>> Yes, it is. >> Okay. Uh, maybe this wasn't the best one, but uh yeah, the app is working. That's what I wanted to see, right? And he he does pick up the axe here, but uh it looks a bit strange.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And he just is it hitting him? I don't know what's happening here, but it's pretty fun. I had a lot of other clips I played around with and yeah, just had a super amount of fun with this scene changer app here. So, basically, just to wrap this up, we generated an app now that took like a clip in. We gave it some instructions.

### 🎬 セクション 33

We added audio and it did actually uh select a frame from that clip. It took that frame, created a new video with Cling 2.6, stitched it together. So, we got the new scene. I think the Walter White Breaking Bad scene turned out pretty good. H of course not perfect, but I think this is just a glimpse of what could happen in the future with personalized uh content.

### 📋 セクション 34

So yeah, just some idea I have executed perfectly by Opus 4 and Cloud Code 4.5 and Cloud Code. So yeah, hope you enjoyed it. Hope this gave you some inspiration and I hopefully see you again for the next tripman's day. Might be tomorrow, might be later. You will see.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Have a nice nice day.
