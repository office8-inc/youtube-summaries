### 🎬 導入

Developers want to disrupt no.js so bad, but can they? No.JS blew everyone away when it came out in 2009. You can run JavaScript anywhere [music] using Chromium's V8 engine, and this was during a massive boom of new programmers getting into the ecosystem through JavaScript [music] specifically. However, this resulted in mediocre performance and required a lot of setup up front. So nine years later, Dino was released and was co-created by the creator of NodeJS.

### 📋 背景・概要

And a lot of Node.js was actually written with JavaScript. Dino initially was written in Go, a much faster language. And then they switched to Rust, an even faster language. But in 2021, Bun dropped. A majority of it was written in Zigg and C++, so really fast.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

It also used u websockets under the hood, making it famously three times faster than HTTP in Node. [music] So they obviously are a lot better, right? Well, in the Stack Overflow developer survey, Node.js is used by 49% of developers while Dino is still at 4%. [music] And despite these advancements, Node is king. But Dino and Bun are to thank for this huge push in Node.js.

### 📝 詳細説明

And who knows, it took Node this long to get to this point. Maybe it's the same for them. What are your thoughts?
