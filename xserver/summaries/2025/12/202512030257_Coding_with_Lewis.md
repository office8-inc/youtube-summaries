What is the hardest thing that we [music] can get computers to do? Read letters on paper.

### 📋 背景・概要

In 1920, Goldberg created an [music] invention that would read characters and convert them to telegraph code using lights and film. And so 40 years later, by [music] 1968, we had OCR A, which a font designed for machines to read text, not humans. Wow, crazy. [music] In 2005, Google open sources an OCR engine called Tesseract, which recognizes characters based on defined rules and use linguistics. [music] So like Q is usually followed by a U, etc.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And in the 2010s, deep learning just exploded [music] in popularity. And that's why captas also were invented, which secretly were training on your answers. Pretty smart [music] to be honest. Tessact would switch to a long short-term memory neural network. And handwriting starts to become recognizable.

### 📝 詳細説明

[music] And now some of the most state-of-the-art languages are the transformers based models. So not only can it read your text and convert it, it can also understand [music] it and use it as some sort of prompt. It's honestly crazy. So when you give computers eyes, it can really do crazy things. [music]
