## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

And here we have it. Damn, that looks good, right? So, look at this background image. Titan bear path of XR2 build guide. They have the rage bar here.

### 📋 背景・概要

Today, uh I wanted to try out a kind a new workflow using claw code where we integrate sub agents. And I wanted to kind of explain how this works. So, basically, I want the user to do like an input. And this could be something as we're going to do in this video. create a cool uh one pager that has my P path of exile build or something like that.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, we're going to send that user input to the main agent and the main agent has control over these four sub agents. Okay, so one sub agent is the image generator that's going to create a spec. So, this is more like a specd driven or image driven way of writing code as you will see soon. And this also has like a style agent that uses files from the inspiration files we can give it. This could be reference images to Nano Banana Pro.

### 📝 詳細説明

And we're going to use a screenshot agent that is going to screenshot the image. So the claude uh code made agent can give feedback uh of how the page is looking. And we have the iteration agent that is going to work more on the iteration loop. So we're going to do a three times mandatory iteration loops to kind of improve the page and we're going to suggest new features and stuff from the iteration agent. So this is like a closed loop where we uh recursively not really but improve the page over time and after the three iteration loops we can say yeah I'm happy or we can continue.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So I think this is a bit confusing but you will see as in in my workflow now how this works. Okay. So let me show you how this works now. So if we go to claude right uh remember we had our sub agents. So I'm going to show you those.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

If you go slash agents you can see here is all our sub agent. We have the style agent, the screenshot agent, the image generator agent and the iteration agent. [music] So what is cool about cloud code is that we can also edit these agents. If I wanted this agent to just run the let's say the haiku model, right? I could do that.

### 🎯 応用例

Uh, and we can also do inherent from parent, but we're just going to select the opus model for this agent. I'm just going to keep it like this. And remember, I said we also need to add some inspiration. So, in this case, I have added uh an inspiration of a path of exile skill. Uh, Path of Exile skill and I have a Path of Exile.

### 💭 考察

Yeah, it's just a styling for a new patch. Okay. And I have some information about the build I want to play. So that is all the inspiration uh content I have given kind of the agents here. So basically all we need to do now is just start a prompt because we have updated our claw.md so it kind of knows about this workflow.

### 📌 まとめ

So I'm just going to give this a prompt now. So I'm just going to do create a insane cool page for a Titan bear build for Path of Exile 2. Send that. And now we should know what to do. So you can see now the first thing we need to do is uh yeah uh search the inspiration page.

### ✅ 結論

Yeah, we need to find the files. We probably need to read those. We are reading all the inspirational uh content we have given this um this setup that was the three images and the build.txt. I can see a dot atmospheric POV style with druid character blood magic uh a couple of skills. Right, let's create the epic page following the workflow.

### 📚 追加情報

So now we kind of come into the part where we need to use the sub agents. You can see the claw code is launching the image generator sub agent here that is going to generate a Titan bear spec. So this is an image. So we're using Nano Banana Pro to create a spec of the page in image form. This is kind of more of the uh an image is worth more than a thousand words kind of thinking part.

### 🔖 補足

So let's generate this uh spec image and we can look it up before we move on. So now you can see we have created our first spec part. So if we go back to cursor now and we take a look at this. So this is the spec we are going to send to uh the the main agent cloud code. So here we have a structure in the top left.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Here's the kind of the structure of the page. We have some design tokens. We have some interactions and what by using Nano Banana Pro you can see we get this clear text and every text is readable here. So we get a bunch of information inside just one image and this is kind of the idea. So you can see we have the cards here Furious Slam Savage Fury and we can compress a lot of information about our page into just one image by using Nano Banana Pro.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And now you can see the image is going to read this output. And from this output, we're going to start creating the page. And hopefully we can use the style agent later to actually do some um yeah, add some assets. So you can see we're going to cue the style agent now to generate some assets for this page. And it's going to be interesting to see how well these assets turn out that we're going to fill in the page.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, I'm just going to let this run a bit more and take you back when we hopefully have something here. Okay. So, you can see now we have generated our first asset. And if you go to the asset here, you can see uh not here. Here is the bare hero image.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay, that's pretty cool, right? So, you can see it's clearly inspired from this art style here that we put in inspiration. And we get this bear here that has these cool flames. And I really like it. I hope we can use this as an asset in the page.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And you can see now, yeah, we generated a new asset. This is the scary fury furious slam skill. Okay, I like it. I think it's pretty cool. And this kind of reflects on this art style.

### 📋 セクション 18

I don't know. I guess it's fine. But uh yeah, it's it's working. At least that's what I wanted to see. And now we're going to create the pounds skill.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And after that, hopefully we can continue building out the page and we can have something that we can check out soon. Okay, so just a quick update. Now we should have all the assets. We have the background that looks great. We have the items.

### 📝 セクション 20

This is the weapon talisman. Okay. Uh we have a couple of skill items. We have the fury mountain skill and the savage fury, I think. Also looking pretty good.

### 💡 セクション 21

So now we're just going to continue and starting to implement these assets into our actual landing page and hopefully this works. Now you can see the page is built. Let me take a screenshot to verify. The page looks epic. I can see all of this.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Uh there was a small error. So we try to fix that. But if we go to kind of the screenshot now this is what we got and you can see yeah there is an error at top here but we could fix that. But the main thing is to see that we are using the assets on the core skills. We have furious slam, pounds, fury of the mountain.

### 🎯 セクション 23

All the assets we created are kind of inserted here. So I'm super happy about that. Primal rotation. We have some rage mechanics. We have a placeholder for an asset maybe.

### 💭 セクション 24

So yeah, this is looking good. And now we are kind of back on the iteration loop. We have run the iteration agent. We have started to generate some new assets maybe. And it's going to be super interesting to see how this turns out now.

### 📌 セクション 25

Okay. Okay, so let me just update you on the second iteration loop. Here are some more assets we have created. This is the skill tree. Here is the icon.

### ✅ セクション 26

This is a rage. I think this was pretty cool. This is the rage bar. I like this asset. So hopefully we can find a way to integrate these assets into the page now by using the iteration agent.

### 📚 セクション 27

You can see we are trying to update the page now. That looks pretty good. And let me check the asset generation to also update the navigation link on the main build page. There we could probably we going to use the rage uh bar there maybe let's see uh but again I'm going to take you back when we have done some more implementations here to see how this turns out okay so we have completed iteration two so if we go here now and let's check out the skill tree screenshot so this is the screenshot we took of uh the second iteration this is the skill tree page we have the rage generation slam damage area of effects ability and I kind of like all the icons here So, that looks pretty cool. But, uh, for now, I think we kind of get the idea here.

### 🔖 セクション 28

We're going to continue with the last iterations and I'm going to take you back when we have kind of the final page and we can explore everything. Look at all the assets we generated uh for this um, yeah, how would you call it? Like an imagriven uh, workflow for agents, something like that. I'm not quite sure uh where we can generate assets on the fly, but uh, so far I've been super impressed by this workflow. So, let's just skip to the final results.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And here we have it. Damn, that looks good, right? So, look at this background image. Titan bear, Path of Exile 2 build guide. They have the rage bar here.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And if you scroll down, you can see we have all the assets, the core skills. We have some small animations, fury of the mountains, our fury pounds, furious slam, we have the rotation, we have some essential gear. Um, okay. I don't know about that, but we have uh also up an hour here. We can go to the skill tree.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Yeah, this is not accurate, but you kind of get the point. We have some uh clusters here. So, this is the key clusters with all the custom assets. Here are the mountain splitter. This is a Titan ascendancy we want to pick.

### 🌟 セクション 32

That looks pretty neat, too. And we have some leveling progression here. Uh up to 90. Okay, that's pretty pretty accurate. If you check out the skill gems here, we have something.

### 🎬 セクション 33

We have all the small uh did we get any assets here? I don't think so. Uh I think we did an asset for that, but these these are not working. But we still have kind of the gem priority. We can check out the gear page.

### 📋 セクション 34

Uh here we have some body armor, helmet, what we want to go for here. And yeah, some flags setup, stat priority, league start, best in slot. Overall, I think this is a super cool way of working. Uh, what I liked most was kind of the custom assets that we build based on the if you go here and we check out the inspiration. So, I guess it based it on kind of this art style, right?

### ⭐ セクション 35

That was the inspiration. If you kind of look at the bear in the background here and I think this is a super cool way to use this sub agents and I'm going to explore this more. But yeah, that was what one I wanted to do today. And I think it turned out pretty good. So yeah, super happy about this.

### 📝 セクション 36

Maybe this gave you some inspiration of what you can do with this sub chance. Thank you for tuning in. See you tomorrow. Have a great day.
