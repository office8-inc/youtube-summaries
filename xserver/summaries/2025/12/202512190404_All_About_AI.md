## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so today uh I just wanted to share a bit about uh something I've been thinking about for a while that I've been wanting to do. And now that we got the Gemini flash model, Gemini 3 flash model, I thought I just want to try it out. So this is like a smaller prototype version of this this simulation. But just to make it short, how this should work is that we have three agents now. Uh all is running on Gemini 3.

### 📋 背景・概要

So one is Jack that works at the daily grind. That's a coffee shop. We have Claude that works at Bean there. And we have Erica. She's the customer of both coffee shops, right?

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, she can talk to both agents. The agents, Jack and Claude, cannot talk to each other because they are in different locations. Uh, but she's a bit of like this gossip girl. So, she also spills information she had with uh Claude here. she tells Jack about and they both kind of are interested in her.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, this is like a small social experiment simulation, right? And what I wanted to really do was to generate this mental images because we can kind of record the inner monologue of the agents and from that inner monologue, we want to create mental images like when you have a thought in your head, you also visualize it. That was what I wanted to try to do. So, I just wanted to show you kind of the demo I have for today and hopefully next week I kind of have the full version and yeah, let's just take a quick look at it. Uh, I don't have so much time today, so I think this is perfect.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, another thing I wanted to implement was of course memory. So, I thought I could take talk a bit about the memory setup I have for this. I'm just going to go quickly through it here. So, if we go to where did I put that? Was it in tools?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I think uh I can't remember. Here it is. memory service and we have mental memory service, right? So for the images, I wanted to create a mental uh mental a memory too. So I thought of like a sliding window so each agent can remember their five last images they or feelings or mental images so they can load this into context.

### 🎯 応用例

Uh but I wanted a bigger memory for the conversations. So here we have like a bigger uh window where we can share the previous conversations. So the thing is that uh the agents only remember their conversations with Erica and Erica with both right because she can talk to both. So that is kind of the setup we have for the conversation. I think we're just going to run it and then you can kind of see how this works.

### 💭 考察

So if we do mpm web because I created like a web UI for this. I mean mpm run web of course. So if we go to our local host now you can see this is kind of the setup. Coffee shop simulation. So yeah we're just going to keep it like this.

### 📌 まとめ

Turns three exchanges one because we don't need to run this anymore. So when I start this now uh we're going to go through what happened. So you can see we are at the bean there coffee shop. Morning Claude. You look like you had a much more graceful start to your day uh than I thought for sure.

### ✅ 結論

Uh composed me. I let out a short quiet laugh and you can see we are talking and you can see yeah there's a lot of talk here and then we get Claude's thoughts here right beneath a cool professional exterior I'm actually hyper aware of how much my confidence is calculated to performance to keep you back coming to my counter my secret hope is to see right through the bravo and realize this is calibration and you can see him this is his dream he's dreaming of her on the closed sign they are kind of in love, right? And Erica's thoughts is that Claude talks about being perfectly calibrated, but but my own heart is hammering so hard against my ribs that I'm terrified you'll hear it. And this is what she is imagining at the coffee shop. In Erica's daydream, the bustling coffee shops fade into a Okay.

### 📚 追加情報

And now we are visiting the daily grind. Morning, Jack. Yeah, there are some bugs here. Uh oh, Erica, good morning. And you can see why is he talking so much.

### 🔖 補足

Uh and then we get Jack's thoughts like this is his inner monologue. Uh he is also kind of dreaming of the same because he also likes her. And then we get Erica's thought. Oh, she's kind of thinking of the same, right? That's not bad.

### 🎨 セクション 13

She's playing both sides. And yeah, Erica imagines Jack looking locking the coffee shop a dirt early pulling into the warm glow of espresso machine light to confess that he has been okay. Yeah, we don't need to go more into that. And yeah, we have to fix this. But this is just an experiment, right?

### 🚀 セクション 14

Because we want to keep the conversation going, but now we're just going to do it three times with no uh context, right? And yeah, it's probably going to be the same, right? They are kind of in love. So this is kind of the start I had and I plan to work more on this. So what I want to do, what I really want to do is generate more agents and we don't have to have this visual.

### ⚡ セクション 15

We can do it headless, right? So basically I want to run like a big simulation where there are more people involved. So this is more like a social experiment, right? And we want to keep track of all the interactions. Maybe we can summarize this.

### 🌟 セクション 16

We can keep some of the images and stuff like that. Maybe create some more interactions between different agents and I think it's just a fun project. I want to bit more uh work a bit more on uh but this was just an example uh what I wanted to do. So the big idea uh today is that I wanted to kind of turn the the thoughts or like the inner monologue of the agents into images. So, we are using the model we are using for this is a pretty cool model.

### 🎬 セクション 17

You should check out and it's super cheap. It's the said image model. So, it's like a turbo model. It's pretty fast. Gemini is pretty fast.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, I totally can run like loads of these simulations, right? If you wanted to. So, we can run it again, right? But now we don't have any. We haven't put on the memory here, right?

### ⭐ セクション 19

Or you can see maybe we have twice in one morning. Erica. Yeah, we did that here. you're really making the rounds today. So, you can see we have now we have the memory loaded.

### 📝 セクション 20

Okay, so we kind of get the same point. Uh, but the point today was that I just wanted to share something I've been working on. I think this simulation thing is a bit interesting, but I haven't really found anything like good use case for it yet. Uh, but I'm going to keep exploring this mental images. I think this is pretty interesting and see where I can go from this.

### 💡 セクション 21

Probably the next version of this, uh, it's not going to be like this. This is just an example I set up just to see if it works. H it's probably going to be something bigger, right? With more agents, more interactions. So yeah, I just wanted to share this uh short video today, but uh yeah, I've been busy today, but I thought I just do a quick update on this.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And maybe this gave you some inspiration of simulations you can run some social experiments. It could be anything, right? And the model we're using is the said image model and with Gemini 3 flash, which is a really good model, by the way. Uh it's very fast so you can do these things on the fly even though we are lagging a bit behind the API here but uh it kind of works anyway. So yeah just a short video today.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Maybe some gave you some inspiration and I'll see you again
