## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Today uh I just wanted to share something if you are kind of wanting to do more cloud code other AI agentic CLIs that is have a heavy up cost right so let's say we do cloud code that's my favorite max 200 this is something I use every month right or at least the last few months so basically I wanted to find something where I can kind of get this for free so I have found like a very successful way of doing this uh that I don't spend a lot of time on right so we had these websites like Upwork, Fiverr. So, basically what I do is I spend a couple of hours a week trying to find these simple jobs that I know Claude can can do, Claude Code can do, probably around in the 25 to $100 range. And I found out so we do like 50/50. We can complete in like a pretty reasonable short amount of time, maybe like 10 20 minutes. And I send my request.

### 📋 背景・概要

Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. That kind of depends. But basically the idea is that it's just background work. I don't really focus too much on it. Just set it up uh give it all the context that needs contact engineering and stuff like that.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And I just let it run and if I see, okay, we complete this job, I send it in for approvement. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. And I can get like a $50 there. And that's nice like because that pays off like a quarter of the price for cloud code. So I thought I'd give you like a couple of examples of jobs uh we can do.

### 📝 詳細説明

Yeah. So let's do it. So, let me just show you kind of how I usually do this now. So, please don't steal this away from me now. But basically, I just go to my Upwork account.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Uh, I can see I have five messages for jobs I have completed. But, uh, yeah, I'm not going to go into those. No. Uh, so basically, sometimes I just search for web scraping. That is something models are pretty good at, right?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Search for web scraping. I just scroll through here. I set this to like less than 100, right? Fixed price. And I just find some different jobs here.

### 🎯 応用例

So, I found this one. Download transcripts from YouTube channels. Uh, download from three channels, 2,000 videos total, and you can do all this, scrape them, and we have some deliverables and stuff like that. Uh, we have like a timeline, and I just quickly go through uh we need to apply for this. And basically, let's say we got this.

### 💭 考察

Okay, so let's say we got this job. Uh, let me show you how I would do this now quickly using cloud code. So I would just create like a yeah not this one uh like a simple directory here. Let's call it agent. Okay.

### 📌 まとめ

So I just do like a job MD. Okay. And I just copy basically the full job description here. Oh, okay. Something like that.

### ✅ 結論

Uh yeah, doesn't really need all of this, but you get the point. Paste it in here. I guess we can remove this. Something like that. Okay.

### 📚 追加情報

So we got the job description here. And I'm just going to give it like a example URL because we don't want to do all of those now. So I'm just going to come up with some kind of URL here as an example channel, right? Okay. So let's say we have Marcus Brownley's channel here.

### 🔖 補足

So I just copied his URL. Uh I went to my cursor. I pasted it in here. Okay, great. And then I just went to a new set here on Claude.

### 🎨 セクション 13

I said read job MD. Okay, so now it kind of read the full job here. It's looking at the URL. Uh, okay, that looks pretty good. And it says this is only one of the three channels listed, but that's fine.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So now I think we're just going to try to execute on this. So I'm just going to ask Claude to create a plan for this now. So now I'm just going to do plan mode, create a plan for this job to show that the system is working before we do all the work because I want to know that it is working before we actually do it. Uh, let's create three videos as a test. follow the instructions in job uh precise.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So sometimes I just I don't do the full job up front. I just have like a proven concept. I send it over to the client or customer or what you want to call it. Um yeah, and I said yeah, we can do this. And if I said yes, I'm just going to do it.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Right? So now we're just going to do a plan and let's see what kind of plan we come up with. We're going to test it. If it doesn't work, we will do some adjustments. So the thing is like while I'm doing this I also have a parallel job working here.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So I usually do two or three at the same time. This is a more complex job and you can see we have gotten somewhere here. Now this is a Whole Foods product scraper job. So let me show you that uh that uh yeah job page. So this is the scrape chip product data.

### 📋 セクション 18

Whole Foods instructed Excel include images and packaging. Okay. So you can see this is a $50 job. So that's a bit higher price and yeah you can see programmatality scrape all the data pull and use images uh output everything in exact Excel format I provide with no guessing and you can see we have some attachments here. So I just started this before I recorded the video and I want to see now if this is the correct uh uh structured output here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Okay. So while we were doing that you can see now we are ready to run this. So I'm just going to do any three recent videos just for the test setup. And now I want to go back and check this job. Right.

### 📝 セクション 20

So this is the output. So this was the Excel file the provider of the job sent us. And this is the format it wants it in. So on the top here you can see what we have done. So we have found kind of the flavor, the category, the base type, the bag size, the price and yeah looks like we got mostly here.

### 💡 セクション 21

We got the everything looks pretty good. We have the calories, sodium, fat, saturated fat, and everything. So, it's a pretty big list. It's 90 items, I think. So, let's do item 9 to 15 now, just as a test.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, I just go back to Claude. Uh, great. Let's do 9 to 14. Okay. So, let's try to do that and check back on it.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Okay. So, now we are done with the plan here. So you can see I always work in parallel and let's say I complete this job 25 plus 50 that's $75 in like yeah I spent like an hour soon maybe 30 45 minutes. So that means I'm like halfway there plus plus. Okay.

### 💭 セクション 24

So let's test this. So this is something I do like I spend like I I only have to do it like 30 minutes four times every week or something. not not every week, but like once a week, 30 minutes or something. So, yeah, let's let this work for a while and check back on it. So, while we wait for that, we can also check like is there any other jobs here?

### 📌 セクション 25

This is $75. Uh scraper. This is more like a Yeah, I don't know. This we are working on. Relay web socket.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh this might be able possible to do this. This is more like a system. We probably need to scrape these X feeds here. Okay. Yeah, that should be possible.

### 📚 セクション 27

That is like 75 bucks. That's a big job if you get one of those. And I always kind of check the payment verification if it has good reviews and stuff like that. Uh but usually they are pretty vetted on this platform. Uh I sometimes do Fiverr too, but I kind of prefer Upwork.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Uh that's just my preferral. Right. Okay. So I see we got a couple of things here. So yeah, we're going to run 9 to 14.

### 🎨 セクション 29

We're going to test this out. Download transcribes. Yeah, seems to be working. We found three videos. The API has changed.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Yeah, we might do some changes. If not, I have a backup plan for this. So, yeah, let's just let this run and see how far we get. Okay, so it looks like the video job is doing quite uh good. So, uh let's do a uh downloaded to CVD just to see that everything looks good.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And if you check back on this job, yeah, we're going to keep running it. We had some issues here. I don't know what happened. So, we need to re rescrape this this Whole Foods job. And yeah, let's give it a more some more time and see if we can complete this in 1 hour.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Okay, so we did the transcript. So, you can see we got the three. Let's check them out. Uh, okay. So, we have that it's in plain text.

### 🎬 セクション 33

No timestamps. That's what the job wanted. We have one, two, and three. Perfect. So, I would say that's uh how much was that job?

### 📋 セクション 34

$25. Kachching. Okay, pretty good. So, let's see if we can complete the $50 job. Uh this is a bit more complex.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So, let's check back and see if we found this. So, you can see uh I tried to do 10 more lines of the Whole Foods job. So, I want to go back to my updated spreadsheet now just to see how it's looking. And yeah, there might be more work to do here, but let's check it out. Okay, so now you can kind of see we filled in all the way down to 15, but you can see we have some VT use here.

### 📝 セクション 36

This means that we have to maybe do some work on the scraper or we have to do some manual work here. But uh yeah, maybe I could figure that out later. But basically, I just wanted to show you that uh I think if we work a bit more on the code, we could complete this Whole Foods scrape uh job here and maybe cash in $50 if we were lucky, right? So, that was bring our total up to 75 in about Yeah, I would say about an hour or something we spent on this. So, that's not bad.

### 💡 セクション 37

70 bucks. 75 bucks an hour. Uh but you got to remember it's not always that you get the job, right? So that's time wasted. But how I think about it, if if I still have tokens here, it doesn't really matter too much because it's just working in the background for me anyway.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Sometimes I just watch TV and I just press continue. Continue. Continue. I check it a bit. Continue.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Continue. You get the point, right? So that is basically how I try to get a free Claude code max 200 subscription each month. Uh, I just tried to I don't know how you say it in English to be honest, but like get the money back by using the tool or something like that. So, I I know this is maybe not for everyone, but if you kind of wanted to justify having this 200, I would spend some amount of tokens and time on trying to kind of re I don't know what to say, repurpose the cost or something.

### 💭 セクション 40

Get the cost back by doing work on these sites. But uh don't get too uh fancy with it. Like don't spend hours, don't spend weeks on this like just to get the cost back. Try to aim for like simple jobs that you can do kind of on the background uh that you al also will be able to check if it's working or not. Don't take on too complex jobs that might be like very draining.

### 📌 セクション 41

Uh that's that's my tip, right? But uh maybe this gave you some idea and maybe this could save you a few amounts of dollars or maybe this could give you the opportunity to finally have that max subscription you wanted, right? If it's OpenAI Pro, uh Google Ultra or if it code max, that's kind of up to you. But yeah, hopefully this gave you some idea or inspiration to something you can do. So yeah, uh thank you for tuning in and like this video if you think it's interesting and I'll see you again for the final shipmas day
