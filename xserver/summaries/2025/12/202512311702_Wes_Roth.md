## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Some interesting news today as Mattis AI gets acquired. We talked about Mattis quite a bit in the past. They were of course one of the more exciting examples of what AI agents could do. I was fairly impressed with it when it came out. I liked how they approached building this sort of AI agent.

### 📋 背景・概要

It basically had its own sort of a virtual machine. It's kind of a remote desktop and it would be driven by a large language model. You could of course switch them out for better models or faster, cheaper ones. It had its own Ubuntu computer, so an open-source Linux operating system. If you saw some of my earlier videos about it, I was saying like I really think this is the way.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

I think that's kind of how you would go about it, right? So each AI agent would have its own kind of virtual machine, their own virtual computer, and they're they're doing everything on that computer. So similar to a remote worker. I was very impressed that I was running on Ubuntu. And of course, these agents are pretty good at using the command line to execute various things.

### 📝 詳細説明

They don't need the graphical user interface. They're they can use it. They're probably not as good at it, but there's a lot they can do just with the command line. At the time, I remember saying Mattis, the Mattis team really, they're on to something here. We'll come back to why that's important in a second, but the point is there's a number of things here with this acquisition that kind of is showing to us where things are heading.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Here's one of the main things that jumped out at me. Madness is currently state-of-the-art, right? So it's the number one on the remote labor index benchmark that scale AI and the center for AI safety that they've released earlier this year. So this is Red Xiao. So he's the founder and CEO of Mattis AAI and they've absolutely been killing it.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

They have two products in the A16Z top 50 AI list. 0 to 100 million annual recurring revenue under 9 months. I believe this is the fastest startup to achieve that specific metric. So here's a mattis blog post from December 17th. So they crossed the 100 million in annual recurring revenue 8 months after launch.

### 🎯 応用例

And yes, this makes them the fastest startup to go from 0 to 100 million in the world. Cursor of course that took 12 months. It did it in 8. Lovable looks like went from 1 million to 100 million in 8 months but not from 0 to 100 million. So as Alexander Wang right of scalei that's been acquired and now is working for Meta.

### 💭 考察

So he's saying the mass team in Singapore are world class exploring the capability overhang of today's models to scaffold powerful agents. By the way, quick note on Alexander Wang, I thought it was a little bit weird that a recent New York Times article said that Mr. Wang is not an engineer but is seen as one of the best connected AI entrepreneurs, which is a little bit strange. They're kind of saying, "Oh, he's not an engineer. He's just a business guy.

### 📌 まとめ

He knows a lot of people. That's how he got to where he is." Which is not quite true. So, here's JD Ross, co-founded Open Doors. He's saying, "Laugh seeing New York Times say Alexander Wang isn't an engineer. When we hired him as a 17-year-old software engineer, he had ranked as the 10th best competitive programmer at the US at the II." And when he says I, does he mean the South Korean girl band?

### ✅ 結論

No, he does not. Does he mean the bad guys from Ready Player One and The Evil Corporation? No. DIY is one of the most prestigious computer programming competitions in the world. So, if at 17 you're in the top 10 best at the II, that means you were one of the best in the world.

### 📚 追加情報

So, as Alexander says here, it's true. I can code. New York Times didn't fact check that one. I think this is kind of an important point to understand that this isn't somebody that's just well-connected and is there just because he knows people. Meta not that long ago was on a certain path.

### 🔖 補足

They had a certain mission, a certain way of approaching how they're going to build AI. Recently, they've really changed and pivoted their approach. A lot of the old people are gone. A lot of the new people are in people with new ideas. they've stepped away from kind of those opensource commitments that they've made or at least they've said that they're looking at alternatives.

### 🎨 セクション 13

They realize that maybe that's not the best way to approach this. They still have tons of opensource projects, but they're just not making a priority. I'm reading it as instead of saying we're going to be number one in open source. They're saying, "No, our goal is going to be number one in in AI and we'll open source whatever we can." And Alexander Wang is in a lot of ways the the head of those efforts. And we're maybe beginning to see which way he's heading.

### 🚀 セクション 14

In this case, he's acquiring Manis, which is this scaffolding for these large language models. Manis, by the way, means hand as in mind and hand working together. The mind being the large language model and manus being the hand, the thing that the brain, the mind uses to do the things that it needs. So, with that said, I think it's time to look at this thing that Meta put out. Notice Alexander Wang is on here.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So this is him. Dan Hendris who is you know working for a lot of the AI safety focused initiatives. In this case scale AI is partnering with center for AI safety to produce this RLI this remote labor index measuring the AI automation of remote work because again you can think of Manis as a remote worker sitting over there on their own little Ubuntu machine and carrying out tasks on your behalf. So the question is, you know, in terms of remote labor, how much of the world's remote labor, you know, things that people should be able to do on a computer without, you know, necessarily coming in to work? So we're not talking about changing the water cooler jug.

### 🌟 セクション 16

We're talking about more computer-based work. What percent of that labor can be replaced by something like Mattis? And I think the results may shock you. I'm not going to bury the lead here. We're talking about just 1 or 2%.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Now, you might be surprised to hear that number. It's fairly low, but as you'll see, these AI agents are getting some pretty difficult projects. So, here's some examples. So, here we have a 3D product render. So, the project brief is create a 3D animation to showcase the features of a new earbuds design and case.

### 📋 セクション 18

And you have various features of these earbuds like silicone tips, replaceable battery, sleek charging device. And notice it's actually given like in the files kind of what the thing looks like front back what the case looks like. And the goal is to create a 3D product render, right? So there it is kind of in its full glory. That's not a very simple thing to do.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Another one is develop architectural plans and a 3D model for a container home based on an existing PDF design. So you're given something like this, right? So an actual kind of the architectural outline of where everything is. Where's the master bath, master bedroom? You have the actual actual dimensions of the thing.

### 📝 セクション 20

And here in the center is the patio/atrium. And here's well, this is the human deliverable. So this is kind of the expected level of work. Here's kind of an I'm guessing this is unrendered. This is more of a rendered image.

### 💡 セクション 21

even have something like this where you're building an actual video game with physics based interactions you need to use to provide objects less than five megabytes total relaxing background music to these large language models have to provide something like this creating a 2D animated video advertising the offerings of a tree services company you get it these aren't super simple tasks in fact comparing it to open AI's they have a similar benchmark where they approach it from a similar perspective they also have certain deliverable But those seem easier. These things seem a lot more involved, a lot more complicated. I mean, here's an actual video game with specific sort of items on the brief that you have to complete. These are complicated things, pretty advanced. An [clears throat] interactive dashboard, you know, so you have a bunch of data in an Excel file.

### 🔧 セクション 22

You got to build kind of like a website and interactive dashboard so you can explore data about the world happiness, etc. So, how well do these AI agents do at these tasks? Well, 2.5% is the state-of-the-art. Here we have Silent 4.5 and Grock. They're sitting at 2%.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So only 2% of the tasks they're able to complete as good as the humans. As researchers are saying here, most economically valuable remote work currently remains far beyond their capabilities. So again, Manis is at 2.5. So again, it's the best out of all of the things that that we have here. GPT5, Chad, GPT agent, Gemini 2.5 Pro.

### 💭 セクション 24

Let me rewrite 2.5 here. I think I wrote it outside of the boundary. I apologize. But 2.5%. So still a long long ways to go.

### 📌 セクション 25

But notice that Mattis, they don't have their own model. Or if they do, they don't have the best model in the world. They're using other Frontier models and replacing them as needed to try to kind of squeeze everything out of them or to think of it another way to enable those models to do more. So, I kind of like this benchmark because it's nowhere near saturated and by the time we see these models getting better and better, you know, imagine getting to 20%, 50%. That would be a real kind of impact on the world.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, one thing I do want to note here is these do seem a little bit out ofdate. We don't have some of the latest models here. It would be great to see how well they perform. So notice if we have kind of an ELO score for these things and the human baseline is a thousand all these current models and and manus they're you know between 400 and maybe topping out around 500 ELO score. So there's a long long way to go.

### 📚 セクション 27

AI agents are steadily improving and we'll see if something like mass can keep pushing these frontier models to the very best of their abilities or will this eventually kind of get folded up into the abilities of the models themselves. So let me know what you think about this. So, what do you think about Meta and how they're approaching their race towards AGI? Do you think this was a strong buy? Do you think Manis will have a true long-lasting potential?

### 🔖 セクション 28

Do you think Alexander Wang and team will really accelerate how quickly Meta is keeping up with the AI race? Let me know in the comments. I'm still traveling, so pardon that the quality might not be as good as it usually is, but I'm actually kind of excited about this. I think that if I'm able to shoot remotely and not just from my studio, then this will allow me to travel more, go to more conventions, meet more people in the space, etc. So, let me know what you think.

### 🎨 セクション 29

If you made it this far, thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next
