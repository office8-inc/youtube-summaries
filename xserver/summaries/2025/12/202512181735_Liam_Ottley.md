## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

A recent survey of the top economists in the world have put the chance of recession in 2026 at 39%. And with such uncertainty just around the corner, there's no better time to be talking about how you can increase your income in 2026 by literally just doing more of what you already do. That's why I wanted to bring on Delaney today, one of the leading experts in job stacking with AI to reveal the method that he used to go from working just one job as a product manager to making over $300,000 a year. The truth is that AI has changed the game when it comes to stacking remote rolls like this and it is accessible to anyone in 2026 using the exact methods that Delaney's going to break down here and he's sharing all the source and he's got a ton of super valuable resources that you guys are going to be able to grab as well. Man, great to meet you.

### 📋 背景・概要

Thank you for coming on. I'm super interested to hear about what this uh this job stacking method is because we're in an interesting spot with the uh the labor market right now and I think there could be some very interesting takeaways for people for uh their careers generally heading into 2026. So um >> yeah likewise to be here. It's certainly a fun polarizing topic. So happy to hash it up.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

>> Tell us a bit about yourself and then we can uh jump into what you got to share with us. >> My corporate background was product management. So I graduated college in 2017. Did product management for about six years for United Health Group, some other big companies and did a lot of different entrepreneurial things. Actually followed your channel for a while before I decided to do this.

### 📝 詳細説明

was like maybe I'll do uh AI consulting things. I was just coming on the scene and um ultimately I got really burnt out from the entrepreneurial things I was doing. I was like man I understand entrepreneurship so I understand how to build systems and I could productize this 150k a year skill set. So that was the light bulb moment before anyone was really talking about job stacking. Now about 3 years ago I was like man I think I could probably just do at least two or three of these jobs.

### 💡 実例・デモ

the one job I had, it literally took me like 10 hours a week to do. And I just started stumbling into it and just like, "How do I get interviews? Cool. Now I got interviews. How do I get offers?" And uh in 2023, I went from earning 80K to earning 400K as a product manager.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And that was like pretty life-changing. I was like, "Dang, for the first time ever after literally like five years of side hustles, have I ever actually cracked this like legitimate income threshold?" >> All right, let's uh let's jump into the the board you put together. >> Yeah. So, we've got a little diagram flow here. It's basically all the different steps to job stacking, but really just to tee it up.

### 🎯 応用例

Um, like I mentioned, I personally was making 400k doing this. I would say anyone who has some corporate basic skills could earn at least 200k. And the sweet middle ground is, you know, 3 to 500k is very possible for people. And the working definition of job stacking because people like, oh go, is that like one full-time? Is it part-time?

### 💭 考察

Uh, typically it's two or more full-time roles that you're working because that's how you actually get the value arbitrage because if you're doing like a part-time job, you're getting paid per hour. So, it's not really you're not really actually getting that exponential benefit from it. It's most effective when you find those 40hour a week jobs. And there's a big component component of this that's how do you become as efficient as possible? There's a whole ethical side of it that you brought up, you know, pre-recording here of can it be done ethically and sustainably.

### 📌 まとめ

Um, my frame on it is if you can deliver the ROI for the company and they are no wiser that you're doing other things with your time, great, good job. You know, they're happy you're getting a fivestar review on your annual report. In my mind, that's how you make this ethical. Um, but yeah, job stacking essentially is the process of working more than one full-time role. >> Just to start, I guess the prerequisite is that it's it's remote and it's white.

### ✅ 結論

And I do have a list of um even on our website you could see a full list of the fields that we recommend. But yes, we typically recommend if you're going to pursue this, you have at least 2 years of corporate adjacent experience because the job market is hyper hyper competitive. So first you have to be able to come across as a competitive candidate before any of this is going to work for you. Um ideally two plus years in anything from marketing, sales, product management, data analytics, software engineering, u really anything that can be done remotely. The thing that kind of ties this all together and makes this possible is the AI aspect of it.

### 📚 追加情報

It's like being very smart about how you use your time using AI tools to like automate or take care of. >> I'll break this down in a second, but the last pillar here is how to make it efficient and sustainable. But for sure, AI and automation is for sure one of the ways to make that possible. >> Okay guys, very quickly, if you're an aspiring entrepreneur and want to start your own AI business and you haven't already joined my free school community, it's down there in one of the links in the description below. has my full free course on how to start your own AI agency as a complete beginner.

### 🔖 補足

And you're surrounded by over a quarter million people who are also striving towards the same thing. There's no better place on the planet right now to be surrounded by like-minded people. And you get free weekly Q&A with me where you can ask questions directly to me about how to start and scale your business. I'll see you in there. Cuz this is this has been a thing, right?

### 🎨 セクション 13

People have uh had multiple remote roles before. It's probably been a lot smaller than it is now, but this is the AI stuff is having such accessible tech to be able to automate certain parts of it. When I was first getting into it, AI was just coming on the scene, so it was harder. But now with things like custom GPTs and whatnot, there's just this huge huge opportunity. >> Interesting thing to ask just now before we get into it is that do you think this is a uh a kind of loophole that's that's going to be patched in the next couple of couple of years or it's kind of like pretty pretty well defended against anything unless they're doing super strict time tracking or all those kind of hoops you got to jump through.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I don't think it's going to completely go away. There are companies who are going to crack down and do more of that like complete endto-end tracking of what you're doing. A quote I really like from Reed Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, he thinks all traditional 9 to5 will will be gone by 2034. Um, and even if that's like a clickbait statement from him, I think to me what that underpins is fractional work will be more and more normalized. And the idea of a 40-hour work work week for an average company, like especially at a big company, if anyone listening or watching has worked at a big company, things move so slow that like they couldn't even give most companies couldn't even give you 40 hours a week of work to do.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Um, I personally think fractional work will become more and more normalized. >> Awesome. Right. So, what are what are we going to get out of this uh this flow diagram you've you've got down here? >> So, this is what I stumbled into myself and that we now show others.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And it's really just the endto-end process for anyone who wants to work multiple jobs. I would encourage if you just break it down into these what is it seven components here. You could land your next 100k job in 90 days and two within you know 6 months. >> Sweet. So I'll just go through all this at a really high level and then we'll break them down one by one.

### 🎬 セクション 17

I'll set the caveat that anyone who wants a job stack you would assume the like hard part to figure out is how to be most efficient in your job. 95% of the work in today's market is getting the job because it's so hyper competitive. So most of this workflow is really about how do you actually land consistent offers because everything is theoretical until you get to that point. So the first is job title strategy. I'll explain why that's really important.

### 📋 セクション 18

You have to get really targeted in what title you're going to go after and you can sabotage all your results if you don't dial that part optimally. Two is resume and LinkedIn optimization. So basically like Google SEO ré and LinkedIn platforms work the same way. Once you have your title, you optimize your resume and your LinkedIn around that specific title. You need to have a system that gets out large volumes of applications.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Again, it's so hyper competitive that you just need crazy volume to get consistent interviews. That's something that almost everyone messes up and is like producing at maybe 1/100th of what they actually need on a monthly basis. dial your interviews, salary negotiations, get a pay bump, get your offer, and then ultimately once you have that job, if you want to do this ethically, it's critical to be as efficient as you can in that role so that it's sustainable. There are people, you may have seen the headline of that guy Sohom, who went viral for working for a bunch of different big startups. His thing was just like stacking paychecks and not giving a [ __ ] So, it's really about how do you get really efficient in your role before you run it back and then this loop just loops back to turning on the system again.

### 📝 セクション 20

That's >> getting you interviews without you having to put in actual work yourself. So, we can walk through that process here. >> The interesting thing about this that you could say is that it it's almost like evidence of the productivity gains that AI can offer. the fact that people can juggle multiple ro full-time roles now and still be delivering at the at the level that companies are happy with and and probably hopefully in a bunch of cases really really happy with so that you can if you use AI correctly uh as you're going to show us later you actually are able to be like two or three times more productive than the average Joe kicking it off job title strategy is really important um the reason being and we've worked with so many people now we have a great data set to pull from the number one driver of how fast we can place someone. And in our program, we do guaranteed placements.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, we have a lot of stake with working with someone of like there's a huge impact if we can't place them. Um, the people we place the fastest, it's directly correlated to how big that pool of jobs is. And of course, there are other ways you can get a job. You could network your way into a job. I see that as very luck driven when you're just relying on network.

### 🔧 セクション 22

I want a system that is repeatable and basically game of statistics. So, for me to feel confident, I'm like, "Hey, we'll take your money, but we're guaranteing we're going to place you." Uh, we want to play the numbers game. The reason you need to pick one specific job title is all the keyword optimization that happens on the back end of these systems. If you're not niched down and optimized for a specific title, you have zero chance of being at the top end of those percentages in terms of like how matched you are to the the posting. And of the 40 pages of candidates, you will definitely not be in the first few.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Just again like Google SEO. So, it's really important to do your research and pick a pool of jobs that if you can build a system that can apply to 2,000 jobs a month or find a way to get the number of applications out. Um, you don't want to fragment that across a bunch of different job titles. If you have it for just one job title, that's the best way to get results and actually start to see interviews when everyone else is saying that, oh, the job market is dead. It's really, really hard.

### 💭 セクション 24

It's just like the strategy is just not being executed properly. So, I took a screenshot of our backend tracker. So we'll do market research of how many job postings there are for each title on a monthly basis and we use a cheat sheet. So like marketing is here we kind of carved out some of the top marketing job titles. Um marketing like and you might not even understand otherwise like are these even different right?

### 📌 セクション 25

Marketing manager versus marketing specialist. You might assume they're synonyms but there are three times more postings for marketing manager. So all other things equal your chances of getting placed are 3x higher. So it's really important to pick a pool of jobs. uh caveat for job stacking as a whole.

### ✅ セクション 26

I don't recommend it for director and above because even though there's marginal pay bump, the amount of pressure you have and the expectation from your leadership is just much higher. So individual contributor roles are much easier to automate and just kind of deliver the results that are expected of you. So that's step one. Pick the right job title. And then it comes down to resume and LinkedIn optimization.

### 📚 セクション 27

This could be like an hourong talk by itself. Uh, but the key elements when you're doing a resume, and I'll show you guys an AI bot we have that just takes a resume and then dials it um using a pretty simple just custom prompted GPT. But key elements for RS, brevity, quantified impact, the keywords is the most important thing for sure. Um, you could have an amazing resume. We talk to people all the time that do, but if you don't get the keyword stuff dialed, you're just not going to perform well.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, this was a real client. We anonymized him. We have this internal tool that scores uh resume all these different benchmarks. And this is essentially a reverse engineering of what that uh AI system baked into LinkedIn indeed zip recruiter is doing when you apply to a job. It's assessing all these things and it's putting you on page 1 2 3 or 30 and that determines if you get called back.

### 🎨 セクション 29

>> Whoa. Okay. Yeah. On on the platforms, is it predominantly through like LinkedIn jobs or is there other platforms that you're you're recommending as well? >> Our top three are LinkedIn, Indeed, and Zip Recruiter.

### 🚀 セクション 30

But with our automation tool that we have, we have like eight different platforms on there, but those are the top three and they all use varying levels of sophistication of these type of platforms. >> AI short listing or something. >> Exactly. >> Um, so over here again, there's like more categories of things that matter, but ultimately the first thing we're doing with someone once we know the job title is optimizing them uh to put them in the top certain percentile. So, I have this custom GPT that we built internally for our um coaching team that essentially runs through this entire process.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, I'll just go through it super high level, but essentially um we want to make sure we're optimizing for the specific job title, getting all the right keywords, and then dialing all those things that matter for a resume. Um, yeah. So, like doing this live. I ran this right before we hopped on, but essentially told our AI bot to optimize the resume for sales manager. It confirms that sales manager is one of those green job titles.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Again, it has enough volume. Sales manager has about 5,000. This dude was going for a different job title before, so that alone is going to drive a huge uptick. Yeah, he was going for director. Um, so that alone will see a huge lift.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And then so these are the key categories that we're optimizing for. Job title alignment formatting, the impact, ATS optimization aka keywords, the skills section, education section, and LinkedIn um cover letter and portfolio. Um that's its own section. So yeah, I won't go through this fully because it's a lot and we can keep it pretty high level. But um essentially what's pretty cool with that we've done >> so that's like someone bringing in their like current CV or or their current uh resume and just chucking it in saying okay where where can I improve here?

### 📋 セクション 34

So that's just probably what they've got. Like for a new person coming into this that's just their one that they got lying around. >> Yeah. So most people that we talk to for the first time are scoring like a 40 out of 100 and that's just normal. So we've custom trained a bot on just all our past resumes and kind of has its own like unique knowledge base.

### ⭐ セクション 35

But anyone could start by just understanding and doing some basic research of what are those like top categories of things that you need in your resume and just kind of working through it. The top takeaway is like get all the right keywords and then even just looking at this super quick like very specifically we want to see about five to six bullet points per job on the resume. Education section really tiny. No one really cares about that. And the skills section is kind of like a keyword hack section.

### 📝 セクション 36

So it's like all those keywords that matter, you want them on your resume. So that's a very high level. Dial the resume, make sure it has all the right keywords for the job tit title you're going after and then dialing your LinkedIn through the same process. So I actually just grabbed your LinkedIn profile and ran it through our tool as well. And you know, obviously you're not out here trying to get a corporate job, but same thing.

### 💡 セクション 37

It'll essentially just rank you on all these different categories, headline, summary, experience, education, other. And you really just want to go through and optimize it in a similar way, very high level. Uh the hack for LinkedIn is you don't have a page limit on LinkedIn. So just like SEO on a website, pack that with as many keywords as you possibly can. Just like write pages and pages of content on your LinkedIn.

### 🔧 セクション 38

No one's actually going to read it no matter what. But the more context it has on you, the more it will recommend you for different job postings and you'll start getting a lot of LinkedIn inbound as well. Just a little preview. I ran your LinkedIn export into our same LinkedIn bot here. And some basic things essentially just get it's it's all keyword driven.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Again, we won't go too deep into it, but the types of adjustments it would make is like, hey, make sure that like the first word in your headline is going to be the most heavily indexed thing, right? So, it's like, make sure that's in there, etc., etc., make your about section really long, put a bunch of impact in there, make it readable, etc., etc. So, tons of stuff here. The most interesting part here for me is I didn't realize how heavily these platforms in in LinkedIn in this case was using like keyword matching and stuff in I thought it was just you apply for the job like we've done hiring rounds on on LinkedIn before. I thought the jobs just appeared in the order that they >> like applied in but there's there's a whole ranking process going on to determine what's on that.

### 💭 セクション 40

What's more powerful is I mean there are hundreds of thousands of recruiters hiring people on a daily basis and like if they're filling a role they're searching on LinkedIn for product managers to like go reach out to and they do a lot of outbound as well and that's a huge shift that happens when you start doing this is you'll start ranking for that search title and like we'll have our clients before we even turn on the application system start getting like five plus DMs from recruiters per day who are doing like automated outreach to set up interviews. So that's that's the meat and potatoes of prepping. Like this stuff will feel annoying to do, but it's so worth it to just get that done before you start getting reps out there cuz you can burn through a lot of the internet of job postings with a crappy LinkedIn and and get no results essentially. >> So you you've actually got the links to those GPTs you want to use. Yeah, we can drop the links to those.

### 📌 セクション 41

>> Yep. >> Awesome. Awesome. That's great, man. Thank you.

### ✅ セクション 42

>> Um so then we've got the job application system. This is my favorite part. It's the most exciting. is definitely the most differentiated thing that we provide um and that we just kind of stumbled into. So we do 2,000 applications a month for people.

### 📚 セクション 43

And what what people don't realize is there are 500 people that apply to every job on the internet. So your chances of getting an interview are way less than 1%. They might be like a third of a percent. So even when you have a dialed resume, like once we've just gone through those first two steps, I still assume we're only going to see a 1% response rate. So typically people are like, I get so many rejections.

### 🔖 セクション 44

I'm devastated. I'm not doing well. And that's just the reality of the job market today. So, it's like if we can't really control that, we the only thing we can control is volume. So, how do we get as much volume as possible?

### 🎨 セクション 45

And and we've played with a ton of different approaches to this. What we found works the best is combined human and AI approach. So we get out 1,200 automated like using an automation tool to apply to jobs on their behalf just the software that runs in the background along with 800 VA done applications per month. Like I would never encourage an actual person do a bunch of applying. It's such a low leverage task uh a low skill task that you could outsource.

### 🚀 セクション 46

It's like when I was first doing the math on this I was like if I pay a VA to run my job search full-time that's less than $200 a month and this is ultimately going to be 100k job offer I get. So like this is an obvious thing to outsource to somebody else. So essentially what we do and and is just like awesome is we set up a WhatsApp chat with a VA who's empowered with an AI platform um and then also just has everything they need to apply on that person's behalf and then it's basically just like a concierge group chat of someone letting you know you have these interviews scheduled. So this is a screenshot I just took. >> Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 47

The person's like, "Hey, you have this application blah blah blah." He's like, "Hey, I just want to let you know I have 11 different interviews scheduled during the process and we might have to turn it off pretty soon." Um, so it's pretty cool. It's kind of just like finding a way. So for anyone, you know, if you were going to set this up yourself, it's >> the takeaway is >> how do I build a system that does this for me so I'm freed up to do high value things. So when I was starting this process, I was working multiple jobs. It's like, >> yeah, >> or even if I just have one job and I'm busy, that's usually the bottleneck for people.

### 🌟 セクション 48

For anyone who wants to explore some AI tools, um, here's a couple. So, we're launching a product called Tsunami. Um, because these other two that I'll mention just have like very big gaps of effectiveness from my perspective. So, there's an AI there's AI apply.co and apply blast are two of the bigger ones. Um, they either have limited volume so you can't actually get that volume you want at a relatively low cost point.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And then also um just quality control issues and like the AI the AI um intelligence behind the scenes that's actually doing the applying just like so many errors that makes only like 20% of them actually high quality. >> Is your product live? >> It's still in construction. So we've got a wait list on our website. We are using it actively with our current clients but it's like you know just our VAS are using it.

### 📋 セクション 50

We still got to polish up the UI and stuff. So that'll that'll drop in the next couple months. So yeah, the TLDDR is combine some sort of AI tool with uh humans and just make sure you get yourself out of anything low leverage. >> Interesting one on on that is yes, you're doing if say you're doing 2,000 applications a month, what's the rough like churn or or firing rate on this stuff? So, do you need to like if you're running a social media marketing agency for once the market really matured, the game just became like blasting outreach, creating content, running ads, just having all these different things all pouring into the same salesunnel and because they expected their clients to churn within like 60 days or so.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So, you just had to constantly be stoking the the pipeline with more people. What's the like do you get the the two jobs and then you're like, "Sweet, I'm good." Or is there like a maintenance thing? It's like you should still be taking a few uh interviews here and there because you never know if if like you might be below performance standard or if uh you know you just want to like add a or swap that job out for a better one that >> Yeah, that's a great question. I would say if people just do that bare minimum and just like make sure they're getting good performance reviews. You're never going to take on extra risk because you're job stacking.

### 📝 セクション 52

Like I don't typically see many of our clients be like, "Dang, I got caught job sacking and I got fired." Um for that reason. I will say just like in general of how um you know some roles that people get will be contracts they will have a natural time limit of like 6 to 12 months anyways. Um but also just companies downsizing or letting off staff that definitely happens and also I do encourage people to just proactively keep that system on if they're open like if they know one of the jobs is not longterm. We place salespeople in six figure roles like really easily really fast. However, often times these companies are overpromising what the experience of working for them is like and either the product's crap, the the team culture is bad, they're they have a lot of churn, so they're not actually making the commissions they want to.

### 💡 セクション 53

So, in those type of situations, it's like, hey, if you don't foresee one of these roles lasting you another 3 months, like get ahead of the game. I always encourage people to just it's better to have options rather than to be back against the wall, no income, needing your next role. And you always want to just assume it'll take twice as long as it likely will. If you're a business owner who's interested in what generative AI can do for your business, you can get in touch with me and my team at Morning.AI in one of the links in the description below and we can start your entire AI transformation process going all the way from the education and training of your staff to the identification of the best AI use cases for your company all the way through to development and beyond. We have worked with some of the world's biggest sports teams and also publicly traded companies.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So, rest assured, you are in good hands. So, the rest of the stuff is is pretty straightforward. Um, interview prep is a huge part I would say here. It's just like it's a momentum game, right? So like getting three to five interviews per week is the hardest part.

### 🎯 セクション 55

If you can just dial these first three parts and have that going, you're it's just a matter of time until you get placed. The interview stuff might trip some people up if you haven't interviewed in a while. Um not really a sexy AI thing, but Quizlet is a great way to just get super effective. What you don't want to do is have your learning happen on live interviews. You want to get through as many reps as possible, as quick as possible offline.

### 💭 セクション 56

U so that when you're getting interviews, you're converting more of them. So, you can use a simple prompt here. Um, I'm interviewing for exposition. What are the top 50 questions I should be able to answer? And then just you just got to brute force.

### 📌 セクション 57

Rep those out loud to yourself. So, you can work on your tonality, work on your delivery, um, and just make sure you're not coming across flat. There are some cool AI tools you can use as well. Uh, Final Round AI and Udei are two different platforms that support with interview prep in particular. I'm a huge advocate of something like this because it's just repetition.

### ✅ セクション 58

how many reps can you get under your belt um in a low-risk environment. And then I do think having like a real mock interview with someone is great as well if you have access to it. We provide that for the people that we support um because these tools are great, but they don't really have full context, right? So sometimes to get just get a real human looking at your looking at your entire broad context who understands you as a person is always helpful as well. >> Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 59

And then simple salary negotiations, there's no reason not to do it. 90% of people who successful who do a solid thorough job of navigating that can get a pay raise. You're almost never offered the actual high end of a salary range. Uh so again, we'll have this for people if they want to check it out. But we have this very comprehensive prompt that we throw into chat GPT that just takes a look at the whole background, your experience, your different leverage points, um and can just kind of help you plan out.

### 🔖 セクション 60

>> And when does that uh negotiation take place? Is it on the call or is it this over email? like do they have the chance to kind of plan their strategy and responses or is this going to be like you need to know pretty much what you're going to say for objections? >> It's a bit of both. So the whole point of this is to help you plan ahead and there's actually like a GPT based role play that it will do with you for the live call itself, but it is a multi-step process where you do want to let them know ahead of time that hey, I'd love to chat about this with you on the call and then you do typically handle the actual conversation on a live.

### 🎨 セクション 61

>> Sick. Okay. Yeah, thanks for dropping that in there. That's super super helpful. And you guys are going to be able to grab this this full resource.

### 🚀 セクション 62

uh it'll be down in the description below. >> So, you do that, you turn it into an offer, and then the last big pillar that I think is one of the most fun parts to talk about is the efficiency and sustainability piece. So, it's like what I definitely don't encourage, like a big no no for me from an ethics perspective is to just run it back and get your next job. Uh because the likelihood that you do it sustainably is very low. So, for me, what I would always do is take at least three months to just lock in on that job.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Um and there's three pillars. So the three pillars to getting really efficient are EQ, outsourcing, and automation. So the EQ is the least sexy but the most effective of all of them. It's not the one that generates clicks and gets excitement, but it's just you can do so much with just your presence and your social capital and your leadership to get rid of like half the work on your plate. So my encouragement is jump all into the role, be a leader, be really engaged, understand your product and your team, and build relationships because then you can leverage those down the road when you want to stop having this stupid like 2hour all all team meeting that is eating up your time.

### 🌟 セクション 64

You're now a leader who's championing people around efficiency rather than like being the dude, the quiet dude in the corner who just like doesn't want to show up to a meeting. I think that's really important. And you know, delegation. So I was a product manager uniquely. There's actually like no work that a product manager does.

### 🎬 セクション 65

all just your job is to make sure the product gets delivered. So that's a unique example but in that example I could leverage this heavily because I could just ensure everyone around me felt empowered to get their work done and uh you know gave them sense of purpose it made them look really good on their end of year reports etc. Uh delegation is a huge thing. Delete as in like, hey guys, let's champion ourselves around efficiency. Maybe we don't need all these meetings.

### 📋 セクション 66

Maybe we can do more Slack updates or automate some of this stuff. So that's a huge one. I say look to that before you look at the sexy stuff. And then you've got outsourcing. So sure you can automate stuff and there's a bunch down here of ideas and kind of like steps on how to do that.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Um outsourcing is also a really great approach. The caveat to this stuff is if your employer knew you were doing it, they probably wouldn't be too happy about it. But um again, it's a riskreward thing. the woman who's now my COO of our company. I hired her because she supported me as a VA when I was doing product management.

### 📝 セクション 68

So, she could help me with pulling together all the and you could really do this with AI now, but for certain use cases, um it might make sense to pay someone a few dollars an hour to go pull all the client testimonials or all the reviews you've been getting on your product and syn like synthesize them down into a report for your manager. It's always an option, right? Sometimes, and I'm sure especially with your audience, automating things is going to be the exciting go-to, but sometimes it might just be easier to outsource a task to somebody. So, I always encourage people to keep that top of mind. >> And then automation.

### 💡 セクション 69

So, there are tons of use cases really anything that you're doing professionally, um, I'm sure you can find a way to at least leverage a bit of automation in that process. I would say one of the biggest lowhanging fruit that really helped me uh, and helps our clients in their roles. So for my my last job that when I was doing job stacking it was in this really niche area of healthcare and honestly it was very hard for me to understand what was going on but what I did was I took all my onboarding resources from the company and uploaded into a custom GPT and it was insanely it literally could do my entire job for me. Again, product management is essentially just documenting and communicating things. But and caveat, these re these tools will only be as effective as the training you provide them.

### 🔧 セクション 70

But I don't even think you need some super complex NAD workflow to get 80% of the benefit you could in like an average 9 toive job. Um, depending on what it is, obviously. >> What's the contractually? How are people uh obligated with the roles that they take on to not be working other roles at the same time? So, I guess that's like the the tricky part about this because I'd say are most employment contracts not kind of like exclusive contracts >> or is that already the case depending on maybe it's and then in the states as well?

### 🎯 セクション 71

>> That's a great question. So, typically the contracts do say that. I break it down in a few areas. It's like is it legal? Uh is it risky?

### 💭 セクション 72

And is it ethical? So, it's not illegal. Like the contracts say you shouldn't. There's no like actual legislation that says you can't work multiple jobs. So from that sense, it's not objectively illegal, but then it's like, is there a risk?

### 📌 セクション 73

Right? So, um, if you're caught working multiple jobs, typically it is in your contract that you're only going to work one job. So, it's like, what's going to happen as a result of that? Um, 99% of the time, the worst thing that could happen to you is you get fired. Um, there are edge cases where a company could sue you, but it's also like that costs time, resources, and stress for a company to do as well.

### ✅ セクション 74

So you would have to do something really bad to have that be the outcome. Uh it can happen when you're working for a government agency. If you have security clearance uh that is putting something very sensitive at risk because you Jobs stack or you're working for direct competitors where there's trade secrets. That's when that kind of stuff could happen. So it is something everyone should consider and make their own decision on.

### 📚 セクション 75

My way of looking at it is again and you can avoid all like the dumb things that could get you fired for job stacking again if you're just focused on being a good employee assuming you can do that like knowing that it takes six months to get a job and if you only have one job that also carries some degree of risk. So it's like it's really just weighing that risk profile for every individual and be like yes I acknowledging I am taking on some risk by doing this. Um but I also for me it was really valuable to understand like it's not risk- free having one job. There are different types of risks in that as well. >> Yep.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Great mate. A stat. A stat for sure. Great question. >> I think that clears up a lot of lot of the questions people have about that.

### 🎨 セクション 77

>> Yeah, the custom GPT I think is really effective. It's a really low hanging fruit thing someone can do. Um I'm sure you even have a lot of tutorials on how to do that. But really high level, you know, defining the role. So, you know, what is your role?

### 🚀 セクション 78

Providing that, providing core responsibilities. If you have a job description for yourself, that's great. Um uploading any resources that you have. So anything from your onboarding materials, anything about your company, publicly available stuff, it might be worth trying to do this in the lowest risk way possible. So if your company's allowed to use GPT, if you have that functionality, I would use it natively within your company just to avoid any risk there.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Define the instructions for the GPT, how you want to think, what kind of tone, any job specific skills that you want to basically essentially write out like templates of how to do specific tasks. Like for us, you know, I wrote out a complete template for how to write the proper resume. So you might want to do that for basically just write write an SOP for anything you need to do in your job and be able to feed that to your bot or bake it into your bot uh for specific use cases that you are that you know are going to take up your >> cool thing that people can look to use. I'm not sure if you've you've picked up on it, but um Claude skills are a really really really cool way I think of it's basically like the the lowest form of like lowest level form of automation in that when you have Claude that's set up with MTP servers connected into like your Fireflies or your calendar uh or your notion or like Linear and all of these different places that you're probably working when you have Claude set up and it's also got the ability to search the web it can think through problems. the skills feature that they have now you can bake in like say if you need to write a end of month report you can write essentially a a sequence of like a promptbased workflow and like okay you should first go into notion and do this and by natural language you can explain how Claude should take take actions and steps on that so like for example I've got one for a podcast prep um so if I'm interviewing someone who's like like if it was like Mark Andre or something was coming on the pod or like some some like huge uh huge guest that I maybe didn't know much out.

### 🌟 セクション 80

I can just I've made a skill now in Claude and I can just like say, "Hey, can you do the research on this person?" And then within a uh within like four or five minutes, I have in my notion new page on them with a full breakdown of all the stuff I found on the web and so on. So Claude skills is definitely a really cool way to automate parts of uh parts of ROS. >> Actually didn't know that that launched, so I'll have to check that out. But yeah, it sounds great. And I think that basically just covers essentially the last section here, which is any automated workflows you want to create.

### 🎬 セクション 81

It's obviously going to be so broad and cover so many different functions depending on your job, but I think the examples you gave are great examples of what are some of those low-level things you can automate. And the way I think about this is like really just map out the use of your time. You don't want to spend all your time automating tasks that take up like 5 minutes a month, but you know, focus on the highest leverage things. >> Is there any risk with building automations out like that that they are in some way able to trace back to to what you're doing? like within certain tools there's like oh hey like Liam accessed this via via Zappy or via like NA10 recently.

### 📋 セクション 82

>> That's actually a really great example of it's like hey should I really try to automate this or should I give it to a VA to do that's a great example and I think just like assessing any of this from the lens of especially if you work for a big company all your actions are probably getting tracked and you're probably often blocked from doing some of that stuff. So, it would likely more have to be tasks where you can like export the file, plug it into your own like native system or on your own like personal browser. Like what I would essentially do is I'd grab whatever I need. I'd email it to my personal self, do everything on my personal computer, email it back to my work computer, and then like do what I need to do with it. So, yeah, it doesn't you're often blocked a bit from some certain tests like that.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Yeah, I mean just from what I've heard about these like big consultancies and stuff, the amount of tracking uh they have internally on everything you do across the entire like internet for the company. Um and they can like predict if you're going to like if you're going to quit. There's so much data that they're getting from everything you do within their ecosystem. So I think that's probably something people need to be uh be aware of. But um this has been uh it's been awesome, man.

### 📝 セクション 84

Thank you so much for coming on. I think this has been a bit of an eye opener for me about just how uh the state of the job market for sure and obviously for the for the audience being able to take this and and hopefully be able to get paid more um because like you said at the start the the economy is not looking too hot heading into 2026. So if you were to want to pick up just a second roll and double your income, uh it would be life-changing for most. So really appreciate you coming on here and and and given all the source on how to do this and of course this resource will be linked down below. you'll be able to grab it in the resources section on my school so you can get all the links to the GBTs and the uh negotiation blueprints and tools like that.

### 💡 セクション 85

Um but mate, really appreciate your time and uh and what you're doing helping people to to make more money. >> Super fun. Thanks for having me. >> So that is all for this episode of the podcast, guys. If you want to see something similar that I really think you'd like, you can click up here to watch another one.
