## 💡 概要

AIツールを活用して収益性の高いアプリを発見・構築・マーケティングする方法を解説した対談動画です。ゲストのCorbin Brownは、YouTubeサムネイル生成アプリ「Thumbio」を開発し急成長させた実績を持つ開発者で、バイブコーディング（自然言語でのコーディング）の実践的なノウハウを共有します。アプリアイデアの見つけ方（自分の経験領域に注目）、優れたプロダクトの条件（1つの問題を明確に解決）、効果的な実行方法（X（Twitter）でのオーガニックマーケティング）の3つの柱を詳しく解説。完全初心者でも、最新のAIモデル（Gemini 2.0、Claude）を活用すれば、プログラミング知識なしでも実用的なソフトウェアを構築できることを実証します。2026年に向けて、ソフトウェア開発の民主化が進む中で成功するための実践的ガイドです。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **バイブコーディングの革命**: 過去2ヶ月で技術が劇的に進化し、Claude Opus 4.5やGemini 3により、複数のAIエージェントを並列実行させて異なるページを同時開発することが可能に。2023-2024年は実用的でなかったが、2025年は完全に状況が変わった
- **アプリアイデアの3つの発見法**: ①自分の経験領域に注目（Corbinは3年のYouTube経験からサムネイルツールを開発）、②新しいAIモデルのリリースを「スポーンキャンプ」して機会を狙う、③非常に具体的なニッチ問題を解決（PhotoshopやFacebookの次を目指さない）
- **優れたプロダクトの条件**: ランディングページで1-2文で価値を説明可能、ユーザーが支払いまでに必要なクリック数を最小化（Thumbioは10クリックで変換）、30秒以内のデモ動画、複雑な作業を簡単・高速化（SpotifyがPirate Bayに勝った理由と同じ）
- **Xマーケティングの効果**: アルゴリズムが2018年のTikTok並みに小規模クリエイターに有利。2,000フォロワーから2ヶ月で膨大なインプレッションを獲得可能。テキストのみで20万インプレッションも実現、ターゲット市場を直接リターゲティング広告に活用できる
- **タイミングの重要性**: 2年前・1年前に実現不可能だったアイデアを選ぶ（競争優位性）。大企業は官僚的で遅いため、個人開発者が先行し月1万ドル達成後に買収される可能性もある。完璧を目指さず6ヶ月継続して学習することが成功の鍵

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

These days, everyone seems to know how to vibe code, but very few people know how to spot viral app ideas to use these vibe coding skills on. And an even smaller percentage of people know how to actually market and gain traction for the apps that they build. So today, I wanted to bring on Corbin Brown, one of the leading experts in using these kinds of tools to build applications. And recently, he's been able to spot his own opportunity and build an app around it called Thumbo, which is gaining a lot of traction right now. And in this video, he's going to be breaking down the entire process of how to spot ideas, how to build a great product, and how to execute and actually market those ideas.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, this is a great pod for anyone looking to build businesses around software, building SAS platforms moving into 2026. So, I hope you guys enjoy. All right, guys. We're here with Corbyn today. I'm excited to jump into this.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

been a a longtime fan of what he's been cooking up here on YouTube for many years now. And it's great to uh finally have him on the channel to be able to run through how to come up with and well find viral app ideas uh to be able to kind of vibe code and build uh as there such an exploding marketplace right now for people and like really the conversion of ideas into software uh that's becoming more and more accessible to complete beginners. So Corbyn, one of the leading experts on uh on on YouTube here regarding this topic and he's going to give us a master class on how to spot these ideas, giving us an example of one he's been working on and show you guys how you can do this as a complete beginner. So Corbin, mate, it's great to meet you and look forward to it. >> Yeah, it's nice meeting you as well, Liam.

### 📝 詳細説明

And I want to just start this video off with something that everyone should know in the audience right now. quite literally doesn't matter your background, your experience or anything when it comes to the concept of coding anymore because vibe coding and this concept of the ability to use human language to make real applications. This isn't a joke. And the issue in the industry right now is that you see a lot of push back on this. And that's due to the fact that a lot of people that are software engineers that might be working for Google or Meta that may have the stance of like, yeah, vibe coding, you can do it, but it's not real.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Of course, they're going to think it's not real, you can't do it, is because of the way that they approach labor, right? They're already in a team management software where they are told to do XYZ. What I can tell you from my experience from coding since I was 12, you can 100% code an app with just human language. >> That's one of those things like the future's already here. It's just not evenly distributed.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And this is a classic one. You look at even kind of the cutting edge of how certain developers who are thinking more ahead, they're willing to sort of drop their drop their ego and drop their old patterns and and ways that they've learned how to do it and gone well. Like at the end of the day, these models are better than humans at a lot of the work. And it's just a case of like how you can structure the workflows to get the most out of it. And I've been diving extremely deep on my own use of uh chord code um within kind of uh aentic engineer workflow.

### 🎯 応用例

And it's it's there's levels to the game and if you do it right, it's it seriously isn't just some like little vibe cody thing. It's it's proper like aentic engineering. >> 100%. And I think a big part of that is that this assumption was maybe correct a year ago, two years ago. Like if you said this assumption like AI coding is fake or the AI code is trash, you're 100% correct in 2023, 2024.

### 💭 考察

not anymore. And there was a huge flip that happened in the last two months, whether that's Opus 4.5, whether that's Gemini 3. I think the one that really sent it home for me to be like, "Oh, this is different because of my experience of building software in the past and how long I knew a piece of labor usually would take was the ability for multi parallel agent workflow where I was able to send off one agent to work on the homepage, one agent to work on the signup page, one agent to work on authentication. Like you can do this all in parallel, which is only possible two months ago. the market's sleeping on it.

### 📌 まとめ

And that's why creating a viral app idea now is so time pertinent because by the time it becomes mainstream and people actually realize that anyone can code, it's going to be like trying to enter Amazon FBA now. The golden years, the the years of lowhanging fruit was like 2014, 2015. It's 2025. So, let's move to the next golden fruit. >> Yeah, 100%.

### ✅ 結論

I think um part of this is that if if the uh engineering becomes so easy and we walk them through this, I'd like to also quiz you at the end of the the marketing side of things. So, let's jump into it. Um, and I mean the parallel stuff, I haven't been able to get parallel stuff. I've been literally racking my brain as to how to get multiple agents spun up working on the same codebase without it completely fing it up. So, >> it is so much fun once you really know it, Liam.

### 📚 追加情報

Like, trust me, it's >> I literally sat down and it it launched like October 25th, uh, 2025 and Cursor 2 is when it first like was really good. Like, they had it a little bit in codeex, whatever, where like the cloud processing was too slow. Once you got able to do it in your local computer, it was just one of the most eye- openening experiences that I've ever went through personally. And that was because I ran a team of junior developers in my other software company. And I would give them a task like change the navbar.

### 🔖 補足

They would take two weeks to give me that task and I would have to iterate back and forth to get the code correct. Multiparallel agent workflow. And that's not a joke. That's not buzzwords. That's not jargon.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Look it up. Trust me, it's new. Genuinely finish that same task in two hours. It's just next level stuff, y'all. >> All right, that's what you're learning today, guys.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, or maybe not maybe not to that extent, but like you'll start on the road to get this. Let's pull it up, bro. >> Okay, so because of the we're basically in a position right now where the barrier of entry to create an application, it used to be a huge knowledge deficit, but in reality, it's just understanding developer fundamentals 101. If you genuinely just know essentially like what is a div, what is a header, what does H1 mean, what does H3 mean, like this might sound like alien language to you right now, but if you know what it is at a developer fundamental level, you'll be able to execute real applications. And today with me and Liam, I want to talk about how to find ideas.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And this you can kind of see with this little graph, little nice little design here. It goes big, a little smaller, and then a little smaller because, okay, some of y'all are going to really argue in the comments right here like Corbin, I think the most important is marketing. But first off, can you even build an application? So, how do you find your idea? I think the best way to find your idea is yes, you can source information in YouTube videos.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Yes, you can source information on X or Reddit. This is good areas to like get information, but lean into your strength. What have you been doing for the last 5 years of your life? If you've been a web developer, you need to make a software for web development. Why am I making this software called Thio here that makes YouTube thumbnails?

### 🎬 セクション 17

Because I've been doing YouTube for the last three years. So, I think you should lean into your experiences here. Okay, guys, very quickly, if you're an aspiring entrepreneur and want to start your own AI business and you haven't already joined my free school community, it's down there in one of the links in the description below. Has my full free course on how to start your own AI agency as a complete beginner. And you're surrounded by over a quarter million people who are also striving towards the same thing.

### 📋 セクション 18

There's no better place on the planet right now to be surrounded by like-minded people. And you get free weekly Q&A with me where you can ask questions directly to me about how to start and scale your business. I'll see you in there. >> Yeah, 100%. I mean, uh, silly for people to like be going outside of their own area of expertise when they probably got a ton of things that they can solve.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So, I see it more so as a as a mental muscle. And I' I've talked about this in some of my recent videos as well. It's a change in the way of thinking. When you run into problems or opportunities or just like anything really in your life and you start to think like, okay, I actually have a skill set that could allow me to execute on something here. I could come up with my own tool either to solve my own problem or you can spin it out into something else.

### 📝 セクション 20

And it's just a different way of of thinking that I think is really it's one of my predictions that I put in my videos recently that next year the people who can have that full shift into realizing that they have the power to solve their own problems with software and just starting on that learning curve of being willing to go in and feel stupid for a bit solving small things and just watching videos like this to get some extra tips and tricks. It really is something that is accessible to everyone now 100%. And I kind of want to take a step back with the idea itself because one mistake I made early when creating software is that I mean think about it y'all. I think everyone's seen uh the movie like the social network. You kind of jump into it like I'm going to create the next Facebook.

### 💡 セクション 21

Take a step back. Unless you're a massive team that has gazillion budget. If you're a small team like to you and maybe one other friend or a developer, you need to solve a very specific problem in a very specific niche. When I approach the concept of thumbio, I'm just doing YouTube and I'm just doing thumbnails. Am I going to try to kill Photoshop and do an entire design software?

### 🔧 セクション 22

No. Because if you're approaching this with I actually want to make a successful product, I don't want you to approach this with like I'm going to create the next Facebook. That that can happen in the future. But I think in reality, you need to laser in. And then by niching down, you now can really laser it in onto your specific target demographic that you care about.

### 🎯 セクション 23

When I do marketing, I do paid ads on Thumbo here. I know who my target demographic is. It's either content creators like me and Liam here or it's going to be YouTube thumbnail editors. So, it makes the process of sourcing users extremely easy. Therefore, whatever your ideas or what you can think of, it should really lean in on your past experience.

### 💭 セクション 24

One idea that's absolutely beautiful to me is a fintech or the ability to lean into the idea of banking and software. But because of the fact that I don't have banking experience, I leaned in personally with building out thumbo to YouTube creation, YouTube content, and specifically thumbnails because I have three years of experience of creating thumbnails constantly. So, how do you find a viral idea? You solve a real pain point. And a real pain point that I personally had was one sourcing really good thumbnail editors and the latency associated with that and then also the time associated with making a Photoshop.

### 📌 セクション 25

>> Yeah, 100%. I mean, the the thumbnail thumbnail talent pool, I don't know. I don't know what it is, but >> it's uh and then yeah, like you said, the freaking the delays and like the latency on getting any designs back and revisions and stuff. It's a it is a great use case and it's a key thing to watch really when you're looking for ideas is that I I call them step changes. When you have these new models that like really well, it's not like I invented the freaking term step change, but it I call them fertile planes actually.

### ✅ セクション 26

like when a a model performance jumps up significantly like we had with say Sora 2 and V3 and also with like Nana Pro and these sort of things even chatbt like the I think it was 40 image gen and I was like wo this is a big step forward when the models jump up in uh in ability and they open up a ton of new use cases there's this like fertile plane for new innovations on it and so in your case there were already like these uh thumbnail generation apps but they were having to chain together multiple steps and be really complicated and now in your case you can use the strength of these models and better prompting and get a a really good uh outcome for your for your users. So definitely around the launch of new models and and improvements on certain major categories like video or image um there are a big opportunities to find things and apply like your own uh problems that you encounter in a day-to-day or that you have some sort of knowledge to um by using the latest models basically >> 100%. And like two major things on that. The first one is we can watch it live right now because you can get like an understanding of practicality what that even meant. But on top of that, what he just said right there is extremely valuable.

### 📚 セクション 27

The model switching is one of the first times we've seen really in software for our ability to easily upgrade our entire software platform with one line of code. Gemini 2.5 image Gemini 3 Pro banana. I know it sounds crazy. The three is way more powerful. And what you'll notice is that now it allows me to do things like simply I go to my asset library, go to the template library here, do a one-click feature like this AB testing.

### 🔖 セクション 28

I take the YouTuber's thumbnail and in one click leverage this new model, Nano Banana Pro, to actually make a real thumbnail that's good enough for a variation. This is different. This is new. And that goes with the idea of leaning of your experience. But Liam, you bring up a really good point, which is the other idea of timing and this idea of fertile ground is extremely important.

### 🎨 セクション 29

>> I call it like it's kind of like spawn camping. I made a made a video a while back about like it's it's lally spawn spawn trapping the the the businesses as they come. So if you just wait around for like a a big new model release like this, um you can literally just camp the spawn of like where these ideas are going to pop up, it's like, oh [ __ ] >> right? >> Follow the money. >> There you go.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And then that's it. And then within 30 seconds, I mean, this would have taken an hour at least with the old way. Then you have to communicate back and forth. And we already we already went over like finding your thumbnail editor and everything like that. But yeah, spawn camping is on point because >> I knew banana.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So I guess another good suggestion and tip here and I can give it I can give you the thumbnail after Liam if you want to AB test it. A really good tip here is it is actually kind of important to maybe be a little active on X or understand what's coming new in tech if you genuinely want to make a new app. I knew 30 days before Nano Banano 3 I should have bought option calls in Google honestly I messed up there but I knew 30 days before Nano Banano 3 came out that it was coming out. So, I was building this and I was building a playlist to show you how to build it because I knew by the time the playlist launched, three would be out and we could do really cool AB tests like we just saw there. And Liam, I'll let one more cook right here for you.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, you can see >> this version for C for clickbait. >> These ones are gone. >> Yeah, I to be honest, I could be using a bit more clickbait in my thumbnails, but >> that's what I'm saying. You need to throw some more money in there. I need to see some big eyes like popping.

### 🎬 セクション 33

The idea is timing, experience, and knowing what is like being an early mo like you could have the mo most you could have the best product in the world. You could build the best social media platform ever. You're too late. I'm sorry. Don't do it.

### 📋 セクション 34

Your time to shine was like 2009, 2010, Snapchat, Instagram. Yay, we're having fun. You don't build products in industries that were like the last 10 years. You could build your canary in the coal mine is not only the ability for like a good idea is ask yourself could I have done this idea two years ago a year ago if the answer is yes you should probably pivot what I just showed here could not have been done a year ago only a month ago >> okay we have to run some AB tests bro and see what it looks like see what the results are >> I'm actually running AB tests right now I'm doing a really funny study actually I'll do it on your thumbnail right I'm doing a study where I'm switching the gender where nothing else changes in the thumbnail other than the gender. I am finding some interesting results.

### ⭐ セクション 35

For some reason, they seem to click more when there is a woman on the thumbnail. I'm not too sure why, >> but we're still doing the study. >> Let me know. I We ran some tests literally on um on just left to right positioning, and if your face is on the left, you literally get a 10 to 20% increase in uh in in in clickthrough rate if your face is on the left rather than the right. So we just like inverted a bunch.

### 📝 セクション 36

>> Do you think do you think that's because of the time? >> What do you think that is? >> The face like our our eyes and like brain are trained to like pick up faces and and eyes and we read from left to right. So when you see the face and you start reading from right to left and then it reads across to the right. >> Do you think in Arabic countries that would be the opposite because they read right to left then?

### 💡 セクション 37

>> Possibly. >> Maybe. Maybe. >> That would be very interesting to see. I I'm I'm actually going to take that tip of yours.

### 🔧 セクション 38

I'm I'm going to put all myself on the left now. Okay. I like it. >> Uh but yeah, so I think for me the three pillars is and we'll go over as we keep going here is going to be how to find ideas, what is a good product and how to execute. The ideas one I don't want you to get stuck on this step.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Yes, of course. Like what's a new thing Corbin like this image generating software? How has no one created a good ad marketing like a I run Facebook ads. Leverage the tech to make a software like this but for Facebook ads, for Instagram ads, for you know visual ads. you can easily create that but don't get too harped on having the best idea.

### 💭 セクション 40

Just start building because what you need to understand is that fundamentally it's just the inertia of building and not getting stuck in too much of the planning phase I would say. >> So what do you say about the concerns around okay but this is going to get absorbed into other other platforms or like this is if this is so easy to do then other people are going to do it. Is it all come down to say in your case it's like the scaffolding or like the wrapper around it and like it's it's the quality of life and ease of use like oh this is an actual built-in AB testing feature. This has a a clickbait a fire feature. So it's like the quality of life things where you've like slotted in things that are specific to the workflow of the user that you so it's like understanding the user and providing features on top of these models that are unique to or specific to what they really want out of it.

### 📌 セクション 41

>> I would say yeah it's two things. is the first thing what you kind of talked about there where it's like in reality Google tries to compete with me by then I'm already 10 steps ahead like no like if this actually becomes a million- dollar product and I'm seeing a lot of growth in it very fast why wouldn't I compete with Photoshop I think the idea that people need to understand though is that you need to prove to yourself you can get $10,000 in a month forget everything else forget adding another feature like you need to build a product that actually works and this actually works and you need to get to $10,000 a month and then when you have that conceptual thought of like, well, Corbin, something like this. Of course, YouTube's going to do this. And maybe they will, but it's a biocracy. They're slow.

### ✅ セクション 42

A lot of developers, conflicting mindsets. It takes years to push out software updates like this on a platform like YouTube because of the amount of layers it has to go through before execution. Second part of that is I just don't even think in life you should ever have that kind of mentality. I I've seen it a lot too as well, Liam, where it's just like, oh, why why who cares? Like, uh, >> why would I start?

### 📚 セクション 43

>> Yeah. Why would I start? because Google's going to do it or or or Microsoft's going to do it >> could make a [ __ ] ton of money in like the 12 20 in between that. Yeah. >> Like uh how do you think these stories of multi-millionaires that just built a software product in their garage happened?

### 🔖 セクション 44

It's because they were first movers and then guess what I mean quote this gets bought out by Adobe. >> Adobe's like well they have the market, they have the users, they have the branding bio. We're too lazy to build out the info ourselves. So, I think that's the kind of mindset you got to go in with. >> Yeah, exactly.

### 🎨 セクション 45

I mean, you could you could say like chart things out and everything's going to be out competed by, you know, like a bigger company or someone else is probably starting the idea starting the same business at the same time as you. There's definitely going to be other AI thumbnail generators that are built around this cluster, but there is an enormous market. It's not like any given startup is going to be able to completely soak up the whole market. So you can always carve out like carving out 10K per month in revenue is a completely feasible thing for for anyone to do really if you're if you're persistent and if you can iterate on the product well >> 100% and I want people to break that ceiling of I want to make 10K a month. I want to make 100K a month.

### 🚀 セクション 46

have to understand there is a lot of money in this world and carving out 10,000 USD for a thumbnail market that is if not multi-million if not multi-billion don't quote me on the billion part because I'm not too sure but trust me look up on Fiverr look up on X look up on YouTube if you're a YouTuber you already know what I'm talking about you get emails by crazy boom thumb editors trust me there's enough for 10K now that now talking about your product yeah don't set ceilings because there's a lot more money in this world than you think there is >> if you're a business owner who's interested in what generative AI can do for business. You can get in touch with me and my team at Morningington.AI in one of the links in the description below and we can start your entire AI transformation process going all the way from the education and training of your staff to the identification of the best AI use cases for your company all the way through to development and beyond. We have worked with some of the world's biggest sports teams and also publicly traded companies. So rest assured you are in good hands. >> Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So uh what is a good product? What's next? >> So what makes a good product? Um a couple things. The first thing and I'm speaking in the way of like I'm coming from the perspective that you're either a individual or small team.

### 🌟 セクション 48

The processes and steps you approach a good product when you're a multi-billion dollar company is going to be different or you have funding. What makes a good product is that you need to solve one like one issue and one issue really well. And an example of this if I come to my homepage I'm not saying here the new AI design tool look at it. It's just saying create thumbnails I get clicks. That's it.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So, what makes a good product is that the user needs to know exactly what they get right when they land on your landing page. They know it's thumbnails. They know it's clicks. Now, other ways you can approve on this that were originally ambiguous on my platform. We're like, "What's a hey bell?

### 📋 セクション 50

Who cares? How many thumbnails do I get?" You need to lean into clarity and providing value as fast as possible. I'll give you a very rocket solid example of this. Right now, my platform, I know my conversion rate is that after 10 clicks, someone will convert to actually paying me. I know it's 10 clicks.

### ⭐ セクション 51

When you want to think about applications and you want to think about building out a platform that you're going to get a really high MR a good conversion rate, you need to think how many clicks does it require or I guess you're building on an app like how many touches does it require for them to convert and pay you money. That's a real number. And through data and through setting up integrations with G4 or alternatively X pixels and like all this all the data, you're able to find out how many clicks it takes to get to a conversion. What makes a conversion event happen? It's when you make your platform as simple as possible, as fast as possible.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, a great example of this, and I'm actually building out a new feature today. I'm gonna try to launch today, is that I know right now this platform, there's a huge roadblock. If a user comes on a phone and they don't like I don't know about you, Liam, but I don't really store thumbnails on my phone, you know, but if a user were to come to my uh platform, they need to have the ability to have a starter template or a pre-made thumbnail that they just take a selfie and now their face is on the thumbnail. Remove roadblocks. So, I would say what makes a good product is that you want to go and you need other perspectives, y'all.

### 💡 セクション 53

So, talk to your friends. I don't care. Ask your mom to use your products. you need another perspective because what you'll realize is that when you work on a product for a long time, there's going to be very obvious things are just like this is confusing. So clarity is number one.

### 🔧 セクション 54

>> I mean, there's a lot of facets to to any product, right? And um I think the landing page is something that people can get caught up on um spending way too long on it as with any business, you know, they think it's all all about the website. But, uh, I think the way that I see like building products and what I'm trying to carry forth into the stuff that we're doing next year is like you can pick an average opportunity and bu like really grind your gears and and like rub your fingers down to like stubs like trying to make this thing incredible and you might be able to build a good business. Or you can just like put the go like put the gold mine over where the gold is and like build the business in your case over top of a very clear like instantly valuable uh task or or thing that it does. Right?

### 🎯 セクション 55

So in your case thumbnails faster like good thumbnails faster and tons of them. Like instead of getting one back from my thumbnail designer I can get 20 back and I can get them back in five minutes and I can get very fast iterations. like there's a a nature to certain problems and this is where the best business is of course made particularly software ones and it's like it's just a good thing to build on top of like a good opportunity and a good match of the technology and and the value that's created from it. So um that's probably one of the the most important things that that I'm carrying into into 2026 is is uh just making sure you're putting the mind on top of the gold rather than trying to >> and I want you to notice what you did there Liam. You you said the business in one to two sentences.

### 💭 セクション 56

That is fundamentally important. If like you're building something right now, y'all, and you can't even just tell me in one like people say elevator pitch, tell me in 60 seconds. We're past that. This attention economy is so cooked where you need to tell me in one to two sentences. That's it.

### 📌 セクション 57

And one of the things I tell my audience when I'm building out software is that that's why when you show a demo video of your product and your value, 30 seconds, that's it. I don't even care if you're like, Corbin, I want to show two minutes worth of stuff. No. And I and I don't know if you agree with me on that point, but I think the attention economy only rewards really fast understanding of information when it comes to a product like this. >> And it's tricky because with vibe coding and andic engineering and things like this, the potential for software is is exploding and the things that you can build, but that also comes with more opportunities for things that you can build but shouldn't.

### ✅ セクション 58

You know, like there's so so many so many use cases of software now that are going to be technically feasible that like just because they're easier to do now, people are probably going to actually consider when previously it would take so much effort, maybe $50, $100,000 to build out a platform, you probably do a lot more thinking about it. So there is a a caution step that people need to sort of keep in mind. Just cuz you can build anything in an instant doesn't mean it's it's it's worthwhile. So um yeah, how do we how do we uh execute on this stuff, mate? What's the what's the step by step for people to to be able to build?

### 📚 セクション 59

>> So, this is going to be the the juicy topic here where a lot of people, my ex at least have been asking me this question. One last thing I want to say on the what is a good product topic is a story and I encourage you all to watch the documentary, not documentary, it's like a live documentary on Spotify. Long story short, the how you win a software and application is that you make a process that takes time and is hard and you make it simple. Now, a very direct example of this is what Pirate Bay and what happened to Spotify and Pirate Bay. people in like I think it was 04 would always just download and pirate music on pirate bit you get the crazy ads you have to download the tar the whole 10 yards all Spotify did was I mean obviously the connect to the music industry that was a huge leg up but they're like wait we see what's happening here just make it easily more easily accessible faster easier etc how do we execute Liam all right so this is a very very much like I've seen a lot of responses at least on X where it's just kind of like oh cool you build an app.

### 🔖 セクション 60

I don't care. Like, how do I get users? And that seems to be, to be honest with you, 50% of y'all, I get it. Makes sense. The other 50% of y'all, put your nose in the book.

### 🎨 セクション 61

You need to learn how to build an app first. Okay. How to execute. A couple ways you can approach this. Now, the first way is going to approach this is that you need to have some type of social presence.

### 🚀 セクション 62

I'm sorry. Like, if you're single or you or have a small team, I don't even care if you tweet five tweets a day. You're building something cool, aren't you? Why are you not tweeting about it? I think the X algo is as good as Tik Tok was in 2018.

### ⚡ セクション 63

And I can say that with 100% confidence because my YouTube channel is at 140K subs. My ex when I started just like a two months ago was at like 2,000 followers. And I'm getting insane impressions just through posting. So I'd say the first branch here is some type of organic flow. And the organic flow that I would suggest you do, especially in this niche, is X.

### 🌟 セクション 64

yours is built on top of a very uh passionate well that that would really help out of course is maybe try to reverse engineer it potentially if you if you're running off ideas that aren't necessarily you haven't got any crazy good ones yourself but you still want to get into this then go find really active communities on X and if that's uh the the marketing channel you recommend the YouTube thumbnail community and YouTube like strategist community is is enormous on X and they're really th have been thriving for a long time there so if you can find hot niches on X and figure out what tools uh that could be cool at a research project. You can use Grock to lally like dig through and like have a look at all the different like top profiles, what are the things they're talking about the most and then come up with ideas off the back of that. Then uh yeah, X is X can be a great platform for that stuff. >> X is a great platform too because it's one of the lowest barriers barriers of entry to creating content. If you think about it, Instagram, you always have to have an image.

### 🎬 セクション 65

>> YouTube, yeah, we're talking about a whole separate beast here. Like we're going Buffalo, honey. But X is you can literally just put text like typing and that text could get 200k impressions. Like no joke. And I think if you especially if you're coming from a back like maybe you want to show your face like Corbin I don't want to show my face.

### 📋 セクション 66

You don't have to. The point is that what I've seen at least with X and it algo is that it actually rewards like if you're doing something cool people like it and other platforms don't necessarily work that way. like Tik Tok. I mean, that used to be the gold age in 2018, but I think from at least what I'm seeing of X, like the algo is being very respectful to small creators to an extent. >> I've got this weird thing, man.

### ⭐ セクション 67

I don't know if it's cuz I'm like grass is always greener on the other side, but like I have I've had this craving of like being like an anonymous small creator on X and just running like a super lean business just all based off X content and like being kind of like lowkey and quiet rather than like, well, I love all this stuff. There is like a part of me that's like I'm kind of I'm kind of envious of those dudes who are like running this like Loki thing that's just purely ex marketed and it's like >> you know what's funny about that? >> I'm pretty sure I think Elon does something like that but it's like a not like not that that but like it's like this idea of like a it's like a second life or like a second profile. I definitely get that cuz >> I think with especially when as your brand gets bigger there's a little bit of like uh like presentation involved. But I think with X, one thing I like about X is like it is it is very much you can you can say a lot of funny stuff on there.

### 📝 セクション 68

Like it's there's humor that you don't really see in other social media platforms which I like. >> Yeah. No, it's it's just got such an interesting like segment of the world on there. Um and you can uh you can get away with a lot of stuff. You >> The memes are hilarious.

### 💡 セクション 69

Uh the memes are hilarious. I uh I mean I can show one right now, but I >> like kind of almost like a comedy platform in some ways, you know, like a lot of the stuff that pops off in >> Look at this. Look at this y'all. Y'all are going to think this is hilarious. So, here's another uh strategy to like uh how do you execute?

### 🔧 セクション 70

You need to find your market, right? So, I mean, look at this. I literally said need a thumbnail editor on YouTube. I say this as a joke, you know, funny because it's funny because I made a software for thumbnail editors. But the amount of responses, I mean, that's 1.2 that's 1,200 new impressions.

### 🎯 セクション 71

And then the second thing, thumb, free marketing, free organic, I'm hitting my target market. The algo will respect your ability to source. What are you building? I need a XYZ. and then just start playing around with it.

### 💭 セクション 72

One thing I'm realizing is that from that organic tweet I'm seeing there, I'm taking the impressions and the engagement from that, and trust me, and Liam, you would know this, all the replies of like, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, and I'm taking that and I'm putting it towards my ex paid ad campaign to retarget them with my ex ads. >> Yeah. >> Warm traffic. >> Yeah. Genius.

### 📌 セクション 73

All right. So, that was one out of three, I think you said, >> I'd say. Yeah. One out of three. So, which kind of led into the second one, right?

### ✅ セクション 74

So I mean obviously Hermosi has a lot of stuff on this as well as we know but I think the idea and he's like a different industry I'd say like software is probably one of the most unsaturated when it comes to like how do you market a software product I feel uh so the second one I would say is paid traffic now I have a lovehate relationship with paid traffic personally I find myself now okay so in life you have to learn a skill you're going to be trash in the beginning I am in the process of becoming really good at x ad payments or just X ads. Realize when you start marketing, especially paid marketing, it's going to be a sunken cost. You're going to feel a little hurt. But what I can tell you is that there is grass on the other side or there's like sun, it's sun and rainbows. It actually does work.

### 📚 セクション 75

It just requires a a learning curve that's different from other learning curves where you don't necessarily have to pay to learn how to code. You can watch me, you can watch Liam. Like you can learn how to code now through vibing. >> You got to pay to get to Exactly. >> Pay to win and pay to learn.

### 🔖 セクション 76

>> Pay to win a little bit. I'm not gonna lie to y'all. Like, and I know you're probably familiar with this, like once you know, you're like, "Oh, wait. It actually works." Like, once you have that Eureka moment, then you're like, "Okay, say less, punk." >> But when you don't have that eureka moment, you're still you still suck and you're still trying to learn paid marketing. It's going to feel like, "Am I getting scammed?" You're not.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Trust me, you just got to learn. >> You just suck. >> It's a skill issue. Like, let's be real. It's a skill issue.

### 🚀 セクション 78

But everything's a skill issue. Like, if you ask me like, "Go to go do fencing right now." I've never done fencing in my life. I'm probably gonna lose. So that's just how it is. I think my rule of thumb when it comes to learning something new is that your threshold should be like six months before you're like like six months of actively working at it like genuinely working at it before you're like maybe I just maybe really this isn't for me.

### ⚡ セクション 79

>> So don't just do it in a week weekend where you spent 500 bucks on X ads and you're like this is trash you know. >> Yeah. Just on uh on the on the content marketing as we were saying before, do you have any profiles of of other people that you've been seeing who are really crushing it with like relatively basic X content or uh just a smart Xfunnel for marketing their uh their software? >> You know what I've noticed in this this space because I'm kind of more in the developer side of this like whole bubble or like yeah bubble of the X marketing. Uh there's this guy which you might know he's called like Levels.io So, and then there's another one.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Uh, let me do Oh, also I integrated some Cloudflare in my software debate. That was actually a lot of fun. Uh, so this guy right here. >> Oh, yeah. This dude's been crushing up.

### 🎬 セクション 81

>> He's an OG. Yeah, he's an OG. Uh, before I even started anything, like he was one of the first guys I saw in all this and he markets really well. But what you need to realize, and I'm not trying to I'm not trying to bash him on all like this respect. You'll notice a lot of his platforms are developer focused.

### 📋 セクション 82

He has 248k followers. So, of course, when he launches a platform that's developer focused and he has all this natural organic reach on X, it's going to kill it. >> Yeah, >> I'm saying that as an advantage. What is your niche? What is what do you do?

### ⭐ セクション 83

Proceed in the same way. If you build a niche around, let's just say design, like you're doing a nano banano for marketing, you become the marketing guy or gal. >> Yeah. >> When you launch a product like this, an app, you'll have the instant reach. What do you think?

### 📝 セクション 84

You see anyone in this space? >> I don't know. I think it's um is it Cody or Corey Schneider? I' I follow him. I've seen him for a long time and he's pushing a lot of if you go Cody I think Cody >> Cody or >> Cody Cody Schneider.

### 💡 セクション 85

Yeah, the top guy there. I follow him and he's launching a couple different softwares and he's uh like SAS platforms and he's just pushing a lot of organic on here and seems to be getting well. What I want you to notice, y'all, is that I mean, the reason I've been I've been falling in love with X, especially these last two months, is that you'll notice on YouTube, Instagram, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, it's like you're getting value, you're getting content, but like look what Cody here says in the first few words, follow for [ __ ] posting, right? End of the day, we're human. Like, we like to laugh.

### 🔧 セクション 86

We like to joke. Like, let's go grab a beer or something like that. Like, end of the day, like we're human. And I think X is is where you can really excel because you don't have to feel like it's a LinkedIn post where you're like you don't know if you can say ship posting if and anyone that doesn't get that joke it's like basically in developer community and apping it's like we're shipping it and we kind of touched on this a little earlier in this podcast is the idea of why would I build X because big Y company over here is going to eat it. Let me tell you a little story.

### 🎯 セクション 87

The next company I'm going to build is going to be a fintech and it's going to be for obvious reasons. is because you probably know what Stripe is. You've probably seen your thumbnails. You've probably seen a lot of money around Stripe. Stripe buys buys out for millions upon millions upon millions of dollars every single competitor that ever touches the space.

### 💭 セクション 88

They bought out Lemon Squeezy like it was nothing. I don't even remember what the deal was, but it was something over 100 mil. What I'm trying to say right now is that this mindset of like I'm not doing it because XYZ company's going to do it. No, no, no. You got to understand there's so much money in this world, they'll just buy you.

### 📌 セクション 89

Let's get bought. So that's what I leave you with. Don't go with that mindset. build the product, you'll find people that were willing to buy. >> Yeah, 100%.

### ✅ セクション 90

You just got to get on the uh get on the ladder at this point, you know, like do the first one. It's probably like it is not going to be the one that you sell for a lot of money. It's just not it's probably going to splutter along and you might get a bit of traction with it and then it's going to die and you move on to the next one. But you compound that over a year or two years and you'll be in a position where you're very confident building software from scratch yourself. you start to understand the marketing side and you're like this is just the game of entrepreneurship and making money.

### 📚 セクション 91

So, we've all got to start somewhere and if you're not willing to take that first step, you're never going to get to the to the finish line. So, C mate, it's been uh been great to have you on here. This is definitely the 2026 year for people to get into this stuff and and build their first apps regardless of what their background is. Last thing, Liam, if anyone is curious about like, oh, they just keep talking about this software like or they like how do I do it? uh we'll go ahead and either send you a link or put in the description down below somewhere.

### 🔖 セクション 92

There's gonna be a playlist. I show you step by step, literally zero lines of code to 70,000 lines of code, how I developed this from complete scratch. No joke. Seven hours of free content >> so far. >> Check it out.

### 🎨 セクション 93

All right, guys. >> We'll leave it there. Thanks, Colin. >> So, that is all for this episode of the podcast, guys. If you want to see something similar that I really think you'd like, you can click up here to watch another one.
