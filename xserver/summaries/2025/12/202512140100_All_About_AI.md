## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

[music] All that time I sat alone in my tower. You were just holding your powers. Now I can see it all. See it all. Late [music] one night you took me out of my grave and save my heart from the f of feel.

### 📋 背景・概要

Keep it 100 on the land. I see the sky skies. Pledge allegiance to your hands. [music] You'll see you'll see your vibes vibes. Don't care where the hell you've been cuz now you're mine.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

[music] It's about to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of the fate of Aia. [music] Okay, so the intro you saw there was kind of the results of what you see here. I just wanted I've been a bit hesitate about sharing this because it's such an effective way to get like millions of view views if you want to do AI video on like social media and stuff and I think the results are pretty cool. uh but I just wanted to share this uh but uh I'm going to talk a bit more about the details later. Uh but basically this is just a very simplified version of this.

### 📝 詳細説明

So the input is uh we're going to you can adjust this of course but the user has to put in like four celebrities they want to do a selfie with and we need a source image. So we're going to generate the selfie images. We going to run the transition video loop. So this is like start the previous video last frame, generate the video, end with the selfie from the celebrity, do a new selfie image, and this is runs in a loop how many iterations you want. And then we just stitch everything together at the end.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So basically, it's a super simple loop, but there's a lot of prompting and kind of setup involved. Uh, but it's not as hard as you might think. Uh I just wanted to show you kind of how uh we we're going to do a full run through of this now just to show you how this works and then we're going to check out the results at the end. So let's just head over to cursor and run this full loop to generate a video from scratch. Okay.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So you can see in cursor here this is kind of my source image for today. Uh it's just a yeah it's just a female right? I I don't want to change about that. Uh but we have different folders here. So we have frames, images, and clips where we're going to save the outputs.

### 🎯 応用例

And I just wanted to go through kind of a full cycle of this now and show you how this works. So instead of doing it here, I thought we can go over to the terminal. So if I do python main.py now, okay, here kind of is the the beginning. So we need to create an array of four celebrities. So we can do one per line.

### 💭 考察

So what uh is the first celebrity we want to take a selfie with? So, let me just think a bit and come up with something. I kind of want a theme. Should we try to do like a team um that is actually inside maybe some TV series or movies? Let's try that.

### 📌 まとめ

So, let's try the first one. That's going to be Rachel from the Friends TV series. And if we click enter, we're going to name the second one. So, let me think of another classic TV series uh character. Let's do Walter White, Breaking Bad.

### ✅ 結論

And for the third one, I think I want to do Michael Scott from The Office. Okay. Uh, The Office. And let's think of a final one. Let's do a female character.

### 📚 追加情報

Okay. So, I got one. I didn't know how to spell this. Uh, Daenerys Targaryen from uh Game of Thrones. Uh, let's do Thrones.

### 🔖 補足

Uh, Thrones. Can I type? Okay. Okay. So, let's now we have our four celebrities.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And now we need to enter a location or a place. And I think it's just going to be I'm just going to try a scene location from the series. I didn't really know what to think about here, but this should be enough, right? So, when we hit enter now, we should really start a loop. Okay.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, we're going to select a a source image. So, I'm just going to use the selfie girl image. And here we go. Now, we're just going to starting. The first thing we're going to do is uh upload our source image.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And we need to generate the selfie with Rachel. And we're just going to go through this full workflow here. Uh I'm going to show you some clips and stuff under way. I think when we have a few stuff. I'm going to take you back when we have let's I take you back when we have the first selfie.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So yeah, let's just wait for that and I'll take you back. Okay. So we have it now. So let's check out here now. So here you can see now we have the first selfie.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Yeah. I don't know if that exactly is Rachel though. Uh okay. Let's just go with it. It doesn't matter too much.

### 📋 セクション 18

I guess that's the fountain from friends, isn't it? But she looks a bit older though. But uh Okay, it's fine. It doesn't matter too much. Uh okay, so now we're just going to continue.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Now we're going to generate the video clip and stuff like that. So I'll take you back when we have the video clip and yeah, we'll take it from there. Okay. So you can see now we have actually generated our first clip here. So if we head to cursor and go to clip, you can see we start with our input image, right?

### 📝 セクション 20

And if we play this now, you can see she's turning around and she's running towards the scene. And you can see the fountain there. And here comes her. Yeah, perfect. So that's the start we want, right?

### 💡 セクション 21

So let's see what happens now because now we're going to change to Walter White. Let's see if we have the image here. And yeah. Okay. He's in that nice uh Yeah.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Or or yellow overall here. That looks pretty good. Okay. Okay, so that's going to be our next uh clip. So, let's uh wait for that.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Okay, so we should have the Walter White clip now. So, let's check it out. So, I'm going to go ahead here and let's click on Walter White. And now you're kind of going to see the transition. So, here she is with the Friends character.

### 💭 セクション 24

Okay, she moves out of that. She runs under that bridge into the desert. Yeah, that is exactly. And where is Walter? Here he is.

### 📌 セクション 25

Okay, that was perfect. So, yeah. Uh, I think I'm just going to let this run now and I'm going to take you back when we have everything now and we're going to put it together, maybe add some music and let's watch the final result together. Okay, that should be it. Right.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, you can see now we have it here. Uh, I just found some Yeah, some Christmas music on So, uh, I don't know if Yeah, it's it's a it's a version I have created myself of last Christmas. So, I added this and yeah, I think we're just going to watch the full final video now with the music, with the two celebrities you haven't seen yet. I think it turned out pretty good. So, yeah, let's just head over there, watch the full clip, and then I'm going tell you a bit more about this after.

### 📚 セクション 27

Okay, so we have it here. So, I'm going to turn off my microphone now so we can kind of hear the yeah, I guess music. And yeah, let's just play it. Once bidden and twice [singing] shine. I keep my distance, but you [music] still catch my eye.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Tell me, baby, do you recognize [music] me? It's been a year. My glow ups [singing] like saying happy Christmas. [music] I wrapped it up and sent it. Saying I love you.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Yeah, I meant it. Now I [music and singing] know what a fool I've been. Cringe. Cuz if you kiss me now, you fool me again. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

### 🚀 セクション 30

But the very next [singing] day, [music] >> okay, so I think that turned out pretty good. I think that workflow was very nice. We didn't do anything. Everything was autonomous. I didn't see any big artifacts in that either.

### ⚡ セクション 31

I think the music was pretty cool. And yeah, it's just a super effective workflow for generating vertical content. And I only put in like four now. Uh but you can adjust this to your needs. If you want 10, you could do like a long one, you can do shorter, just one and two.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And there's bunch of other things you can do with this workflow if you just get into the trenches. And that's what I wanted to talk a bit about because on my the aividcourse.com platform, uh I think I want to do a more indepth setup of this. Uh, so basically what I want to do is I want to kind of go through the code, go through all the prompts because you kind of need that if you want to copy my exact workflow. So I'm going to over the weekend, maybe early next week, I'm going to put up a video on the course platform where I explain this. Maybe I find a way to share the code, too.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And the price is now uh 29. Uh, but I might have to put it up a bit. So if you really want this uh you can just sign up now to get this price. I'm not going to change it retrospectively, but uh if you want in early and you want this price, uh yeah, sign up now. And basically, I think this could be a very effective way and you can evolve it to whatever you want it to be.

### 📋 セクション 34

[snorts] So, yeah, that's basically what I wanted to share today. a pretty cool workflow that has I don't know how many views I've gotten on this workflow, but it's very effective and it's fully autonomous and you can just make adjustments to kind of do make it be whatever you want to be, right? That's the idea. So, yeah, thank you for tuning in. Uh maybe this gave you some inspiration of pipelines you can build from this.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So, yeah, see you again uh probably tomorrow. Have a nice day.
