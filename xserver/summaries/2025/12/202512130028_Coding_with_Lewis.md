## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

On June 25th, 2015, Chris Wansrath was a happy man. What began as his passion project eight years earlier had reached its first stable release, Atom 1.0. Free, open- source, and built entirely on web technology. Atom was a first of its kind code editor that would fundamentally change the landscape of software development. And Chris knew that.

### 📋 背景・概要

But what he didn't know is something buried deep within Adam's codebase wouldn't just power the most pivotal applications of the late 2010s. It would also eat Adam alive. In 2007, 22-year-old Chris Wrath stepped into a bustling San Francisco bar. He was there for a weekly meetup called I can Ruby. Yes, I know 2007 was a very different time for memes.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Sitting alone in a booth to take a break from the commotion was a man named Tom Preston Warner, an acquaintance of Chris. According to Tom, some unknown feeling compelled him to wave Chris over and show him a project that he was working on called [music] Grit. This was a little piece of software that allowed you to access Git repositories in an objectoriented manner using Ruby. And this turned out to be the early version of GitHub. And I'll get into more details in an upcoming video which subscribe for that.

### 📝 詳細説明

But put briefly, Grit modernized the clunky command line interface of Git, making it way easier to share and collaborate on code projects. And as a self-taught programmer, Chris was used to the hurdles of digging through forums and online tutorials. So needless to say, he loved Tom's project. And of course, the rest is history. >> Could you explain to us in a few words what is GitHub?

### 💡 実例・デモ

>> What is GitHub? It's a social code repository. The whole point is that you can share your code with other people very easily and they can share their code with you. >> And why have you become so famous in such a short period of time? >> Because lots of very cool people chose to use it.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

>> Okay. >> But to Chris, modernizing Git was actually downstream [music] from the ultimate vision that he had. He wanted a modern, accessible code editor [music] for a new generation of programmers just like himself. A few months later in mid 2008, Chris began work on a side project called Atomicity. [music] It was a code editor inspired by Emacs, a popular customizable application Chris referred to [music] as the holy grail of code editors.

### 🎯 応用例

But Emacs was just as old as Chris and his age was definitely showing. For example, in order to customize or build packages for Emacs, [music] users had to learn its proprietary language. The issue was actually the norm amongst code editors of the time and [music] a major point of frustration for Chris. He wanted a hackable code editor built using familiar high-level web languages [music] like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to open up customization to a wider pool of users. Now, [music] as GitHub demanded more of his time, Chris had to shelf this project.

### 💭 考察

But in 2011, [music] GitHub launched a platform that allowed developers to edit code directly [music] on GitHub itself, leveraging a technology called ACE to give code editor functionality in a browser setting. And this caught Chris's attention, [music] prompting him to dust off his old side project. And just 3 days later, he had a [music] new Atomicity prototype, one that also used Ace, but in an OSX [music] web view. A web view is pretty much what it sounds like. Think about when you open a link in the Reddit iOS app.

### 📌 まとめ

It's [music] still in the app, but functions like a browser wrapped inside of it. So for developers, a web view allows for customizable keyboard shortcuts, simple installers, and access [music] to desktop only features that you couldn't get on like Chrome or Internet Explorer. But it's also extremely tedious to develop. In order to access desktop only features, developers needed to know a lower level programming language to bridge [music] the front-end JavaScript to the back end. It also only supports one platform too.

### ✅ 結論

So code would be different for Windows and Linux. And [music] to top it off, different operating systems meant different built in browsers and different results is a bit of a nightmare. So one year later in 2012, Atomicity switched to the Chromium embedded framework which let the developers embed a Chromiumbased browser into their desktop apps which provided a more consistent experience across devices and operating system since Chromium was already built on those operating systems. Now, in keeping with his vision for a hackable application, Chris wanted to use JavaScript everywhere throughout Atomic City and typically JavaScript only ran in your browser. [music] But an up andcoming technology called Node.js leveraged Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine to let you run JavaScript nearly anywhere, even on the desktop.

### 📚 追加情報

And since the Chromium embedded framework didn't integrate well with Node.js, JS. Chris and his team used Node WebKit, which combined Chromium's rendering capabilities with Node.js, transforming Atomicity from a simple code editor into a fully featured desktop application that was fully powered by JavaScript. And thus, the Atom shell was born. A powerful engine deep within Atom that allowed this software [music] built using technologies to run as a desktop application. And for the devs, Adam shell was simply a way to get their app running.

### 🔖 補足

>> I think it was like three people originally were sort of just working on it like at GitHub before it was even like talked about at all. And they had tried um there was like NWJS and then there was another one had the word Chrome in it. I think both of these libraries tried to do the same kind of thing which is allow you to build desktop apps. and they ended up talking to this guy Chang who had been working on NWJS and he also shared this vision for like alternate version of what the library could be and so he started working on it at GitHub and it was just called Atom shell. It was literally just built to build atom.

### 🎨 セクション 13

It was just a thing that existed so Adam could exist. >> But by the time they realized it true potential, it would already be too late. Hi everybody. This week I'm proud to join the students, teachers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations taking big new steps to support computer science in America's schools. >> One of the things that will determine whether a country is successful or not in the future is whether you teach maths and science and crucially computing in the right and the modern way.

### 🚀 セクション 14

>> Our best resource is sitting [music] here right in this room. you young people, Canadians themselves, uh, ready to step up, ready to create the things that those old guys like us couldn't even imagine. >> This is a new life skill, opening up a world of opportunity for men and women. >> Adam had its public beta release in February of 2014. The timing was perfect, enabling [music] it to capture a massive market of fresh programmers who found Adam's convenient features and modern aesthetic much more approachable than other options that are on the market.

### ⚡ セクション 15

This thing exists for no other reason than to just make Adam hackable and make me happy. >> This is what I like with Atom. It will all open my files and folders here in Octopress. >> Adam is my new friend, but he won't be coming to Thanksgiving. He's my favorite text editor.

### 🌟 セクション 16

It wasn't just graduates and delusioned millennials like myself seeking a career [music] change that were drawn to it. The entire tech world buzzed with excitement. And before Adam, a fully featured development environment typically required bloated corporate software. [music] Atom was lightweight, only needing specific additions to get the job done. It was one of the most popular betas of [music] all time, but it wasn't without controversy.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Years before Adam's release, Chris had garnered a huge reputation as an outspoken open-source advocate. [music] >> I think it's put the geeks in charge, the people at NASA who are working on this code, who are involved in the open source code, the actual people developing it, controlling the project, maintaining it. Give them the power and let them work directly with people in the open source community who are interested. If you want open source to succeed, you've got to play by the rules of open source, which are uh ironically not that many rules. which is why one key detail in Adam's beta raised some eyebrows immediately.

### 📋 セクション 18

Atom was closed source software, meaning developers didn't have access to the inards of the application to modify, improve, or build upon. It felt hypocritical. After all, Chris's mission with GitHub was to empower developers to openly share their code. So why wasn't Adam [music] doing this? And to add another layer of irony, one of Adam's biggest competitors was Brackets, which was free and open- source and made guess who?

### ⭐ セクション 19

None other than Adobe. Yeah, that Adobe. In response to the backlash, Chris decided to open source Atom under one of the most permissive licenses. And the decision was wellreceived. Over the course of his beta, Adam grew a substantial user base and market share.

### 📝 セクション 20

But as more eyes explored the inner workings of Atom, a new conversation began brewing amongst developers. On its surface, Atom was a powerful, if not revolutionary code editor. But its core, Adam shell was something truly remarkable. And now that Atom was open source, it was free for everyone to take. [music] When writing desktop applications, developers encounter a key problem.

### 💡 セクション 21

How do you get your application to run on multiple systems? The modern-day answer is to use desktop frameworks like QT, which compile applications into a code native to various operating system. In short, it translates applications so they match the look and [music] feel of any operating system that you're using. And this saves developers from the tedious and expensive work of writing and managing multiple versions of the same application. When creating Atomshell, the development team had a similar idea, but their framework had significant advantages.

### 🔧 セクション 22

First, a lower barrier to entry. Developers could use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [music] Highle common languages to build desktop applications. By comparison, QT's [music] core is C++, which carries a significant learning curve and a vastly smaller pool of programmers. And second, [music] you got faster iterations.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Web technologies are designed for rapid deployment. [music] You make a change, you deploy it, and then you rinse and repeat. No large compile times or marketplace reviews. [music] It's just on the web. And third, code reusability.

### 💭 セクション 24

Once developers wrote a web application, they could reuse most of, if not all, of their front-end codebase to create a desktop version, saving a massive amount of time [music] and work that they wouldn't have to end up doing. And these were just a few of the many advantages that Adam Sheld offered. And trust me, they did not go unnoticed. Less than a year into Adam's beta, developers were already using Atomshell for all sorts of desktop projects, some that we're still using to [music] this day. In April of 2015, just a little over one year into the beta, the [music] Atom team caught onto Atom Shell's true potential and completely separated it from Atom's naming, turning it into what we know today, Electron.

### 📌 セクション 25

>> Electron. >> What is Electron? >> So, what is Electron? >> Massive companies leveraged Electron to quickly develop cross-platform apps for millions of users. But as Electron proliferated, the apps that it powered, [music] including Atom itself, started having some unexpected issues.

### ✅ セクション 26

Now listen to this. In order for Electron to run your code on your machine, it packages three things. One, a full Chromium rendering engine. Two, a Noode.js runtime. And three, your application code.

### 📚 セクション 27

You essentially have to launch a full web browser instance [music] just to run your application. As a rough comparison, imagine if every time you use Windows, you had to launch Minecraft and run Windows inside of the game. I mean, it sounds silly, but you get the point. Now, is it possible? Sure, but definitely not the most efficient way to do it.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And over time, users started to notice this sluggish performance among electron powered applications, including Atom. in some cases just to open a 2 megabyte file. Atom [music] would take over 3 seconds and consume a whopping 400 megabytes of memory just to open it. So you're now running Cyberpunk on ultra settings just to use a text editor. It didn't take long for Electron to be notorious for its subpar, sometimes [music] just awful speeds.

### 🎨 セクション 29

But soon another code editor would change that opinion overnight. [music] As a smaller, more nimble company, GitHub blitzed Atom to center stage. Meanwhile, Microsoft, one of the biggest competitors, was a bigger ship, as you know, and much slower to turn. Still, Microsoft's vast experience in creating developer tools, was unrivaled, especially at the time. Visual Studio was one of the most popular ideides and has undergone nearly 17 years of iteration before Atom was [music] even in a beta release.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And despite this, many complained that Visual Studio was a heavy overkill desktop [music] application that lacked extensibility, especially for the types of applications that were [music] being built at the time. By comparison, other editors let you open up a file and get started [music] instantly. No bloat required. And so in 2013, 2 years after GitHub released ACE, Microsoft responded with their own browserbased code editor project, Monaco. But as browserbased idees failed to gain traction over the next year, the Monaco team took a step [music] back.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Instead, searching for a way to develop their desktop application using web technologies. And wouldn't you know it, they found a free open-source framework that did exactly [music] that. Atom Shell. Eyeing Adam's growing popularity and market share, the Monaco team got right to work and set an aggressive launch date just 6 months out. And by April 2015, Visual Studio Code preview was released.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Developers were skeptical. Setting aside the oddity of Microsoft releasing a free cross-platform desktop application, the fact that they used a bloated Electron framework was uninspiring. [music] It was actually kind of crazy. But that skepticism quickly melted away. It was fast, extremely [music] fast, sometimes over four times faster than Atom.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And before developers could even react, Visual Studio Code went full open source and launched an extensions [music] marketplace. So, how did Microsoft take an infamously slow architecture and make it fast? Well, Visual Studio Code had three major advantages. First, [music] unlike Atom, VS Code extensions ran in isolated processes that didn't block the UI. This meant that when you started VS Code, the extensions loaded [music] afterwards, so you could immediately view your files or start typing and get right to work or even have that illusion of things being [music] a lot faster.

### 📋 セクション 34

Second, Project Monaco, the foundation of VS Code, was heavily optimized before [music] VS Code was even conceived. And third, Visual Studio Code encoded [music] information as binary rather than text, saving a significant amount of space. >> Yeah. So really, you can write really fast Electron apps. And with Adam, Adam first of all is getting faster all the time.

### ⭐ セクション 35

But a lot of that has to do with the actual JavaScript and how it was written and not Electron itself and Electron's capabilities. It has to do with are you doing a synchronous call when you should be doing this async [music] type of thing. So if you look at uh Visual Studio Code, which is also written in Electron, it [music] is really fast and I don't feel like when it came onto the scene, I don't think that people said the same thing about it. >> And over just months [music] of updates and community road maps, Visual Studio Code secured a substantial market share. Both code editors were still competing [music] fiercely, splitting the user base across two applications with an uncertain future.

### 📝 セクション 36

That is until Microsoft made its next move. >> Time now for our stock of the hour and that is Microsoft. Shares of the software company put in a new all-time high this morning as Microsoft announced it's buying GitHub for $7.5 billion. Abigail Dittle has the details. >> In 2018, Microsoft announced its intent [music] to acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion.

### 💡 セクション 37

Although this was met with scrutiny in the European Union, both EU and US regulators would approve the deal without any conditions. For developers, a single question was, "What would happen to Atom?" Thousands of developers had spent [music] countless hours of unpaid labor, building plugins, fixing bugs, and reporting issues for Atom, [music] a code editor that they just did out of love. And now Microsoft had the power to squash its biggest competition. But Nat Freeman, GitHub's new CEO, went on Reddit personally to calm fears, promising that Adam would continue to be supported. >> Adam is a fantastic editor with a healthy community, adoring fans, [music] excellent design, and a promising foray into realtime collaboration.

### 🔧 セクション 38

At Microsoft, we already use every editor from Atom to VS Code to Sublime to Vim. And we want developers to use any editor they prefer with GitHub. So, we will continue to develop [music] and support both Atom and VS Code going forward. But even if developers trusted Freeman, [music] it quickly became clear his promise couldn't be kept. Visual Studio Code continued to release monthly updates while Adam stalled out and lost community interest.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Atom plug-in developers were reluctant to make the switch. After [music] all, they've been burned before by betting on a single platform. Some hedged their bets by simply porting their Atom extensions over to VS Code, but within 6 months, Atom commits frequency dropped by [music] 76%. Within a year, core developers jump shipped to the VS Code team. 419 [music] days after Nat Freeman's promise, the last major update to Atom was released.

### 💭 セクション 40

Now, was this just a natural death or was the plug being pulled? In 2022, it was announced that Atom was sunsetting. >> We've decided to retire Atom in order to further our commitment to bringing fast and reliable software development to the cloud via Microsoft Visual Studio Code and GitHub code spaces. Microsoft may have made a better product using the same engine that powered Atom, but for the [music] developers who built Atom's ecosystem, this wasn't a market evolution. It was an abandonment with a corporate [music] speak goodbye.

### 📌 セクション 41

For plug-in developers, the rise and fall of Atom was an all too familiar story. Contribute hours of labor, watch the company profit, then get abandoned when something better comes along. While it may seem that Visual Studio Code took the crown and [music] reigned forever, this story really has no end in sight. [music] One year after Adam was sunseted, three of his core contributors announced a new code editor, [music] Zed, a performance focused editor powered by Rust, now boasting over 70,000 GitHub stars. That same year, four friends forked VS Code to create Cursor, [music] a VS Code like editor with better AI integration and currently the fastest growing software company of all time.

### ✅ セクション 42

Adam had 1.1 million users when it died. But it won. Not the editor, but the idea. Right now, Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, and Visual Studio Code itself account for billions of daily interactions running on Adam's framework. With open source, death isn't the end.

### 📚 セクション 43

Your code lives on in competitors, [music] successors, and even the thing that killed you. Every cursor blinking in VS Code carries Adam's ghost. [music] And when VS Code eventually dies, well, someone will fork it, too, and make something better. Thanks for watching and subscribe for more.
