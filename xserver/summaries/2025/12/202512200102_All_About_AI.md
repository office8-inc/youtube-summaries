## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So I said create this image and see if you can wrap it. So that's all we can see in the sky. So [laughter] okay, I guess it worked. Look at this. All right, not bad, right?

### 📋 背景・概要

So now we can walk around in this meme world. Can we also look down? Wa, that was trippy. Who we got here? We got Pepe.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

We got the cat. And if you look up, that's all we can see. We can still see the cows. This changed, I guess. Can we worship the meme?

### 📝 詳細説明

The meme is real. A couple of days ago, Google released their new Gemini 3 flash model, and I've been playing around with it for a while, and damn, this is a good model. Uh, it does perform very well, but I kind of like the speed of it. So, I thought today uh to try it out, I needed to create something uh that needs speed. It need some good model, right?

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, I thought about doing some kind of live website that you can control with your voice and just say what you want on your website, your game or anything. It could be anything like in the background, whatever code you want it to be. So, today we're going to play around with this. But first, let me just show you how this is set up. It's a super simple pipeline and then we're going to get into testing it out.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

See what we can do with it. So, this is kind of the system I set up, right? We have the website. We can just go into Yeah, it's just going to be local now. Local host, right?

### 🎯 応用例

And in the background, we can talk. So, I'm just going to push T. T for talk. And I can say something, right? And whisper is going to keep track of what I'm saying.

### 💭 考察

It's going to transcribe this with the fastest model we have. And it's going to turn that over to Gemini 3 flash API. And this is going to generate some code and it's going to update our page in real time. That is kind of the idea, right? And so far, I've been testing it out.

### 📌 まとめ

It works pretty good. So today I just want to show off how we can use Gemini 3 flash to try to try to play on all its strength. Uh good coder, very fast speed, very good at agentic tool calling. So I'm just going to show off a few things like that and see what actually we can do with this. Uh yeah, pretty cool setup if you ask me.

### ✅ 結論

Okay, so one thing I forgot to mention is that I integrated this set image model. So we can do tool calls, function calling because I wanted to test that out part of Gemini 3 flash 2. So if we run this uh server now uh okay local host and this is kind of the start page. So how this works now is I can just press T to talk right and I can say something like you can watch in the top corner here. Okay so uh just to get started just create a title center of the screen welcome to my hacker page make it kind of fit the theme right.

### 📚 追加情報

So when I let go of the T now, you can see this is spinning and it's working. It's transcribing. Sending the code to Gemini 3 FL uh flash. And hopefully we get kind of an updated title on the screen here now. And we're going to try out the function calling.

### 🔖 補足

Okay, so that's pretty cool. Welcome to my hacker page. Yeah, that's a good start. Now you can add like a fitting image underneath the title that kind of fits this style of uh uh homepage. So, I want to see if it's going to do a function call now.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Uh, let's see. Okay, so you can see here. Hopefully, it's going to make a function call to set image. I'm just going to wait and see a bit. Okay, so you can see we did generate the image.

### 🚀 セクション 14

That's pretty cool. Okay, so now we got a good start here, right? Okay, so I think this is fine, right? So, let's say I wanted to start over again. I added some commands.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, I can just press T again and I can say go back to a blank page. And this is like a command I added. So when it kind of sees this, it's going to kind of wipe out the code and we can go back again to the fresh beginning. This is like a special command. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So now we are back here and we can try something else now. Okay. So what can we do now? So basically we can do we can do yeah animations and stuff. Uh just start off with like a ball red ball that is going to bounce on the floor.

### 🎬 セクション 17

uh make it use real physics and also have a button to restart the drop. So we can do stuff like that that is we're probably going to shoot some kind of framework. Uh I also did mention that we also have a tool to install packages. This is also what part of the tool calling I wanted to test out and so far it's been working pretty good. So if I ask for like a package it just installs it via the tool calling I set up for this.

### 📋 セクション 18

So let's see how fast this goes now. This should be like a red ball dropping to the floor and we should have a reset button. Yeah. Okay, that's pretty neat. I don't mind that.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Um, okay. That's pretty cool physics. Uh, but now uh let's do like a simple game where uh we need three images and we need a word and we're going to try to match the word with the image. So if the user picks the correct uh image, it gets uh like a point or something. So let's see if we can create that simple game or something on the fly here because remember we want to test out the function calling.

### 📝 セクション 20

We want to see if it can call up create three images and maybe it needs to create six images and it needs to add in like the simple game mechanics. So let's just wait for that. Okay, so we got something here. So we have the word matcher. We have the word astronaut.

### 💡 セクション 21

Uh, select. Great job. Okay. Cyber Punk car. [laughter] Okay.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And beach. Okay. So, it's astronaut. So, we didn't get any new uh images, I guess. Tropical Island.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Reset game. Okay. Not the most interesting game if you ask me, but uh it did work. It actually at least tried to do what we asked it for. So if you wanted to change it up a bit now I can say something like go back to a blank page.

### 💭 セクション 24

Okay. So what I want to see now is can we actually create like a Minecraft world. So I want to see if we can add in one thing. Let's say you wanted I want a wall here. So almost like a real time game editor.

### 📌 セクション 25

So let's see if we can do that. So, first you start by creating like a Minecraft clone 3D nice environment with some trees and you can walk around a pretty big canvas. So, let's just start with that and then we can see uh if we can add one specific thing into the world here. Okay. So, you can see we got this.

### ✅ セクション 26

That's pretty good. Yeah, I like this. We have some trees. It's not the best, but uh but let's do something else now. So let's say I wanted to Okay, so we need to add something into this game.

### 📚 セクション 27

In the center of the canvas, it should be like a statue that is like this AI god you can worship to. And if you press worship, uh some kind of particle explosion singularity is going to happen. Okay, so that was a pretty crazy prompt, right? So, I want to see now if we can keep everything the same and we can just add this single item or like thing into the game here. Okay, that looks quite better.

### 🔖 セクション 28

That looks something we can do. So, I see down here I can press E to worship the AI god. I can go up here and I can press E. Okay, singularity achieved. Okay, that was pretty cool.

### 🎨 セクション 29

I didn't kind of expect that. Oh yeah, we can do that. That's pretty neat. And now I can just jump around and let's say add some pretty cool Minecraft cows that is circling around the statue in the middle. Okay, so we got the cows.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh, so now I'm going to try to create an image that's going to wrap around here. I asked for that. It's going to be a meme image that's going to wrap around in the sky here. So I said create this image and see if you can wrap it. So that's all we can see in the sky.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, [laughter] okay, I guess it worked. Look at this. All right, not bad, right? So, now we can walk around in this meme world. Can we also look down?

### 🌟 セクション 32

Whoa, that was trippy. Who we got here? We got Pepe. We got the cat. And if you look up, that's all we can see.

### 🎬 セクション 33

We can still see the cows. This changed, I guess. can reverse ship the meme. The meme is real. Okay, that's pretty cool.

### 📋 セクション 34

And yeah, that is what I wanted to do with Gemini Tree Flash today and I've been super impressed. If you haven't checked this out, I definitely would give it a try and we have to do more with this. Uh I think we maybe need to go into open code and try it there to see how fast it is. I didn't do that now. I just wanted to create this system here and I had a blast playing around with it and I couldn't really think of anything else to do with it, but there has to be more, right?

### ⭐ セクション 35

and we're going to explore that. Uh yeah, hopefully over the upcoming weeks we're going to try in open code, see what we can do there. So go check it out. You won't be disappointed. Super cool model from Google and Gemini.

### 📝 セクション 36

So yeah, thank you for tuning in and I'll see you
