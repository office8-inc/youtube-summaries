## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

All of us know that AI is going to change the future of the world. There's a battle in AI going on between the United States and China. You never want to bet against China because you have a country that has the largest amount of STEM graduates, right? Science, technology, engineering, mathematics. Most [music] Americans, I think they look at China almost like a North Korea.

### 📋 背景・概要

It's one guy at the top. It's not. It's completely different. China is run by engineers [music] and you know the United States is run by lawyers. The rise of China is certainly something that has challenged that US hijgemony because now countries have an option.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Hello everyone. My name is Cyrus Jansen. I'm a geopolitical analyst focusing on China and this everchanging world that we now live in and it is changing faster and faster every day. It seems like we're in kind of an exponential jump right now. So maybe we could start by getting our heads around what are the kind of equivalent companies that are in China that we can kind of use in a in American terms for reference like seems like they have sort of the equivalent of Facebook and Google and then is there kind of an open AI?

### 📝 詳細説明

maybe you could just give us a broad landscape. >> Yeah, absolutely. Uh, so Dylan West, thanks so much for having me on the podcast. You know, I think all of us know that AI is going to change the future of the world. And I think right now what's interesting is there's a battle in AI going on between the United States and China, right?

### 💡 実例・デモ

The big the biggest two biggest superpowers in the world. They're definitely the two biggest influencers in the AI space as well. So it's it's kind of an exciting time because I think when you talk to people in the AI space I I think there's a lot of uh you know very bullish sentiment from people because you know at the end of the day you know it's about trying to create systems and you know and work towards better technology that's going to help our world evolve and and let us all live a better life. So as far as the companies I mean you know we have the big companies that are in China now they're all using AI. So I mean you you kind of look at for example uh Alibaba um you're looking at 10 cent and then Huawei would be really the main one that's the kind of a big player here that would be kind of similar to your uh Nvidia because they're developing the chips and the technology that's going to be driving that.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So you know for example Nvidia's obviously been in the headlines the last couple of months. Uh Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO uh very bullish on China. He's been going to China for over 30 years. uh just gave a fantastic interview actually where he really talked a lot about you know the truth about China that and you know that interview uh actually was on a pretty big YouTube channel didn't get a lot of views you know something around like you know maybe 200,000 views but I think there was a lot of a lot of people that uh really should see that interview and I did take some clips out and I did share that on my social media and you know he just said some really good stuff about how you know how fast China is growing and how the the key thing with China that we have to understand is that when the government gets behind something, that's where the the industry is going to move. And so there's not a government in the world that can move as fast and efficiently as China.

### 🎯 応用例

And it makes sense, right? It's a one party state. So if the party says, "Hey, we're moving towards AI, like this is going to be a big priority for us." Well, guess what? You know, any company that's going to be working in that respective field, they're going to get additional funding. They're going to have easier, you know, a green light for access to technologies, to permitting, to everything like that.

### 💭 考察

There's less red tape for them to go through if if it's in the interest of the government and the nation. And so that's what we're really seeing right now is a big movement from China and a big movement from these tech companies. >> Yeah. And do you feel like that is a methodology that's going to beat America in the long run? I mean do you think they'll end up having the most cutting edge models?

### 📌 まとめ

>> Well, I think you know there's a couple interesting case studies that we can look at. You know I think you know earlier this year all of us you know in this AI space you know we're looking at deepseek you know which I think was a really fundamental shift in the market because all of a sudden you know I remember you know listening to Sam Alman you know talking about open AI there was a very famous clip where uh there was an Indian on you know venture capitalist who said hey Sam you know what if we wanted to start something from scratch what if we wanted to try to build something that could compete against an open AI and Sam Alman you know very famously just kind of looked at him and laughed and it's don't even try. Like impossible. Like you can't even you can't even begin to get to our level because we're so far advanced. We're this.

### ✅ 結論

We're that. And it was a very arrogant, you know, statement from Sam Alman because, you know, he thinks it's like, oh, I've got I've got all the technology. I've got all the cards. And then you see what Deepseek has been able to do is they were able to develop it on a shoestring budget. Uh essentially have a a model that is very compatible with an open AI and in some tests actually perform better.

### 📚 追加情報

And you know this is something that I I think what's really interesting here guys is I would say you never want to bet against China because you have a country that has the largest amount of STEM graduates right science technology engineering mathematics. So when you go to all of when you really do your research and you're starting to look into China and this is this interview that I listened to Jensen Wong you know he said they have some of the best entrepreneurs some of the best engineers because they're coming from the most advanced schools. If we actually look at Chinese schools and how they're ranking around the world, actually Chinese universities are catching up with their American counterparts. So I, you know, to answer your question, you know, is China going to win this race? I I think I don't know if it's a if it's a a winner and a lose.

### 🔖 補足

You know, I think that you have two great countries working towards something, right? There's amazing AI developments coming out of China. Obviously, there's amazing AI developments coming out of the United States. I think what I always do and what my big work on my YouTube channel is is always talking about how the United States and China complement each other, right? And and again, if you have a bunch of engineers, you know, you know, whether they're scientists or engineers or astronauts, you know, whatever field it is, you know, if it's dedicated to science, they typically don't really let politics get in the way.

### 🎨 セクション 13

They really want to work on, you know, their respective field. And so, they're all about collaboration. And so I'm I'm very much one in how do we actually um you know create a better AI experience for the world and you know if if China is moving that needle and the United States is too like how do we complement each other and how do we actually work together because we all we all live on one planet. So how why don't we make something that we can all benefit from. >> Yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 14

It seems like uh one of the biggest sort of advantages that the US has right now is still chips. So it's chip production, Nvidia, etc. Um, and so I guess there's some myths floating around about whether or not it's possible for China to catch up in chip design. And even recently, I think there's um, you know, it seems like they're saying that they have their own chips to run their own models, etc. Some people are suggesting maybe that's a little bit of a bluff in order to try to get US to sell uh, more Nvidia chips to China.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Where do you fall in all that? like can they recreate what TSMC what you know Nvidia and um Taiwan did in terms of chip manufacturing or is that not going to happen and if so kind of how how does that play out? >> Yeah, it's a great question Wes. So I think there's two things we want to look at. Number one, we have to look at where China has been and where they've come from.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So for example, a few years ago, you know, we would look at the the chip production in China compared to the United States and we could easily say that China was, you know, 3 to 5 years behind, right? And in that terms of chip development, you know, a 5year head start is monumental, right? I mean, it's basically you're you're at you're so far ahead that you're never going to be able to catch up because obviously 5year head start, the United States is going to keep refining and getting better. Now again what's what's happened in these last I would say five years specifically is that China has narrowed that gap down a lot and this is something that Jensen Wong you know actually said very specifically in this interview he said a lot of people think that China is you know years behind is it two years is it three years in Jensen Word's own words he said sorry in Jensen Huang's own words he said they're nanconds behind they're really right behind us and they are closing the gap faster and faster and faster than we could ever imagine. I remember Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, he had a he had a a similar statement where he said, you know, our lead in AI is so big that China will never catch up.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And I'm confidently to say that like I'm going to say it's from now on like we've won the race. There's never going to come a point where China will catch up. And again, I I think my message to our viewers here is you never want to be in that position where you're kind of betting against China, a country full of mathematicians and engineers and people. uh again like China really functions well when their back is against the corner and you know you have no other option but to kind of you know invent yourself out of it in a way. So again I I mean I yeah does the United States have a chip lead?

### 📋 セクション 18

Absolutely they do. Is China closing the gap? Absolutely they are. And I would say that it's very possible within a few years um that that honestly China does catch up to that and there won't be that strategic advantage for the United States. Now the interesting thing is is when we look at Nvidia chips, you've got the A100s which is the most advanced AI chips.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Now the US government did not allow Nvidia to sell those chips to China because of fears of you know military use or national security. And so Nvidia said that's fine. You know what we're going to do is we're going to make a subpar version. We're going to make the B100s. We're going to make the H20s and we're going to sell these chips to China.

### 📝 セクション 20

Now this don't forget this. This is a very valuable market for uh for the United States, especially for a company like Nvidia. The China market to Nvidia is worth about $15 billion. So, this is very lucrative. This is why Jensen Hong is literally flying to Beijing all the time, meeting with trade organizations, talking with people because it's like, hey, look, we're making $15 billion worth of revenue over here.

### 💡 セクション 21

That's not a that's not a small amount. We want to sell our the best chips in the world. You know, we think Nvidia is the best. We want to sell it to everybody. So Jensen Hong is very much that businessman and somebody that's just very practical, right?

### 🔧 セクション 22

Nvidia makes the best chips. We want to always dominate the chip market and we would like to see that everybody uses Nvidia chips whether you're in the United States, China or any other country for that matter. And so I think what you know what you're seeing right now is a very interesting thing that's happened within the last two weeks is that at first point you had Joe Biden administration they they blocked Nvidia selling these A100 chips. Okay. So what China did is they bought a ton of the H20 chips and this is again very lucrative for Nvidia, very lucrative for Nvidia shareholders.

### 🎯 セクション 23

China's buying, let's say, you know, they could take 20 or 30 of these H20 chips and they could basically reconfigure them to then equal the output of say one, you know, A100 chip. So they can basically just buy a large quantity and be able to compute the same amount and at the same time obviously just needs a little bit more chips, but they could be able to make that calculation. Now what has happened is is that because of this trade war and because of the tensions between the United States and China, China has kind of a plan B. And that plan B is make sure that we're developing that domestic market very intensely. And so Huawei has now been able to catch up and been able to reach a point where they're able to match that same production quality of of the H20.

### 💭 セクション 24

Again, not the A100, the high level, but the H20. So now this is the kind of a whole 180°ree change. Donald Trump has said, "Okay, you know what? we're going to allow Nvidia to start selling again to China and we're going to be able to sell that H20 chip. But then literally about three days later, China came out and said, "You know what?

### 📌 セクション 25

We are not going to actually buy them anymore. In fact, the Chinese government is now going to ban Chinese companies from buying the H20 chip because we don't need it anymore. And we want to make sure that our domestic market is being fueled and that companies like Huawei are getting those sales because those sales are going to drive further R&D and it's going to benefit us because our goal in the long term is certainly to close that gap down. So kind of a long-winded answer there, but it's it really, you know, there's a lot of moving pieces in this story and you really need to understand what's been happening over the last, you know, 3 to 5 years. Can you can you explain where money kind of comes into play?

### ✅ セクション 26

Because we just see like kind of ungodly amounts of money in the big tech companies. I mean, it seems like if you don't have a trillion dollars to spend over the next 10 years if you're not doing a hundred billion >> in infrastructure, then you're you're not going to compete with Microsoft because that's what they can do. You're not going to compete with Tesla and Elon Musk. You're not going to compete with Microsoft. So, um, what like how many trillion dollar 10-year plans can they put together?

### 📚 セクション 27

And would they be government funded or is there enough big companies there to give us a run for the money? >> That's a good question. You know, there's again it goes back to that first point I mentioned as as far as if the government really wants to move forward that industry, they're going to certainly, you know, put together uh tax incentives. They're going to put together um you know, proposals that are going to allow those companies to flourish. So I think for example uh you know we brought up Tesla just now uh the entire electric vehicle sector.

### 🔖 セクション 28

This is a very bullish market for China. Uh it's no surprise that for example BYD is an amazing company. They're number one company in the world now as far terms of actual auto sales as far as the quantity of sales. And so again what happens is is what's very interesting and I'd like people to know know this about China is that in China we always tend to think of China as a a very authoritarian government. And for example you've got Xi Jinping at the top.

### 🎨 セクション 29

It's a oneman rules the party and everything comes from Beijing. Actually China is not like that at all. China is actually a very interesting society because everything goes down to your local economies. And so it's actually it's I'm going to give you an example for our viewers to understand. It's no different than the United States where for example we have 50 states, right?

### 🚀 セクション 30

So the laws here in Nevada are very different than Texas and California. You know, some states have uh no state income tax. Some have, you know, very high state income tax. You know, some industries would be taxed less than others. So it works the same way as far as the provinces in China.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So for example um you know in this electric vehicle industry uh there was a certain province that said hey look the government wants to incentivize this and we want companies to come to our province and build their things. So what we're going to do on the provincial level is that if you come and you build a electric vehicle company here, we are not going to charge you a local tax, right? So we're going to give you a massive advantage for coming here. And so and so you know you can save a ton of money for that, right? So obviously that worked, right?

### 🌟 セクション 32

A lot of companies came and what happens is is also in China is that you have um it's a very cutthroat local market. And what that mean by that is is for example there are hundreds of EV companies that are around in China. But what happens is is that because of the competition domestically, it's so hard to survive that out of let's say the hundred maybe 80 to 90 of them are going to fail because they just simply can't get the numbers. They simply can't survive because they're going to get eaten up by the other competition. But again, if you can survive the local market in China, much like a BYD, you're going to be able to really achieve global sales.

### 🎬 セクション 33

you know, if you if you can become the number one brand in China, you can easily go expand your brand around the world. That's not an issue because it's so hard to really kind of survive domestically because there's so much uh competition, even competition with other provinces. So, like we always say, we kind of have a joke in China where it's like, you know, you're talking about whether it's EVs or AI. Um actually, the competition is like between Shanghai and Beijing and then Beijing and Guangho, like it's these actual provinces that are kind of competing against each other, you know, trying to attract talent. And a lot of it goes through uh you know local funding.

### 📋 セクション 34

And so it would be local local governments and their budgets that are funding a lot of these things. And so that's that's something that a lot of people don't really understand about China. Again, we tend to think of it as this authoritarian one man rules the entire country. You know, for most Americans, I think they look at China almost like a North Korea. It's one guy at the top.

### ⭐ セクション 35

It's not. It's completely different. And every province is different. You know, every all these different industries are very different. So there's a lot of uh you know right now AI I mean there's there's thousands and thousands of startups you know coming in in China.

### 📝 セクション 36

There's tech hubs all over the country. Um again there's you know fundraising you know being made as far as you know trying to go IPO and things like that. So yeah there's a lot of uh investment in this particular industry and it is definitely going to be the future as we all know. >> So I'm curious because I mean here we do talk quite a bit on the US side about the race the competition. Some people are worried about a potential war in the future as sort of historically what happens is one sort of superpower.

### 💡 セクション 37

Uh Eclipse is another. There's usually some sort of a military conflict. Um so people are worried about that. People are worried about losing the AGI race between US and China. >> How does China what's the Chinese perspective on this?

### 🔧 セクション 38

Is there the same sort of hostility and competition and win at all costs or is it a little bit more measured? You know tell us a little bit about that. >> Yeah that's a great question Wes. I mean, I think one one thing I always want people to understand is that, you know, China when we talk about like the potential conflict escalation or potential confrontation with the United States, uh, this is something the Chinese people and the Chinese government and and and China as a whole most certainly doesn't want. Um, you know, China has not been involved in a war uh since 1979 when it was involved in the Vietnam War.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Um I mean it was it was honestly um you know this is this is something that you know China is is at the at the core of it is a very peaceful nation. You know they don't want war you know and so I think what the thing is is when you're looking at you know a competition as far as you know will China be overtake the United States as the number one economy? Will China become the world number one superpower? I'm not I don't think it's necessarily China's goal. I don't think they have a goal of saying look we want to make sure that the United States fails and that China's number one.

### 💭 セクション 40

You got to remember, I mean, let's be honest, the Chinese economy is very interconnected to the US economy. This is something that I talk about a lot is is, you know, why trade is so important, you know. So, for example, I've been very vocal on my YouTube channel. You know, I'm not for Donald Trump's trade war. I don't support the trade war.

### 📌 セクション 41

I'm I'm very much for open trade with countries like China and every other country in the world because I think we live in a global economy. I would like to do more trade between countries. And so, I think with China, you know, you're tapping into your natural strengths, right? China's strengths right now are it obviously is its ability to manufacture. That's why it is the top trading partner to 120 countries around the globe.

### ✅ セクション 42

That's a huge thing to understand. And so again, it's it's kind of like, you know, in the United States, we don't manufacture anymore, right? We've we've outsourced all of that overseas. We've shipped all those jobs overseas. So we manufacture very little compared to what, let's say, China does.

### 📚 セクション 43

And so our economy is more built on you know finances and financial systems and you know tech companies like you know the magnificent seven stocks that we see that really you know hold up around 30 to 35% of the stock market but in China you know obviously a lot of that power still comes in manufacturing and trade which obviously gives them a lot of leverage around the world. You look at uh for example continents like Africa. You know 53 of 54 African nations they actually pledged their um you know allegiance to China earlier this year saying look we really want to foster a closer relationship you know with China. So yeah it's it's definitely I would say it China most definitely doesn't want a war. um they definitely want to just rise peacefully and it's it's it's kind of what I talk about is the rise of the multipolar world where you know we're going to now have two superpowers the United States and China both are going to be superpowers it's not a unipolar world anymore where only the United States is going to be number one >> okay that makes a lot of sense sorry and just let me follow up because this is I was kind of leading towards a particular thing here um and that is this so China's been publishing tons of open source stuff and it's been very impressive.

### 🔖 セクション 44

I mean Deepseek of course um there's been multiple other companies Moonshot Kim Moonshot um many many more and it's not just on the large language models it's also we're seeing with robotics unit has yeah >> some open source stuff it's it's very interesting to see so uh Balaji for example kind of floated this idea or potential theory that seems to make sense to me >> that it's it's an approach because like you said they dominate in terms of manufacturing the hardware Right. >> And us a lot of our companies especially you know in the tech space they kind of lead the world in in software. >> Right. >> So how do you take away sort of that edge? Well if you sort of devalue the software by producing cheap open-source readily available large language models and robotic software etc.

### 🎨 セクション 45

you sort of take away the big you know Microsoft Google open eyes at their ability to generate revenue. uh uh you know kind of just undermined a little bit and China is still dominating on the hardware producing robotics and widgets and whatnot devices etc. So is it possible that I this is you're the perfect person to ask this question. Is it possible that the government is subsidizing the Chinese government or pushing or doing something in the background to be like just open source like let's make sure that the US and everybody else is building on a uh a Chinese open source systems models and and maybe that's kind of a strategic push by the Chinese government. Is that possible?

### 🚀 セクション 46

>> You know that's I wouldn't say it's yeah it's definitely possible. I mean I think that's it's a very interesting question. I have to be honest I haven't actually thought about that. I mean you've you've brought up in a good point right if we if we build it all in open source it kind of devalues the software aspect right and then maybe the United States wouldn't have that strong monopoly like a Microsoft or these other software companies that say look hey this is where our leverages you know you can get the hardware from China but you need the software from the US so we still have the upper hand I mean this definitely possible I think it's also where you know China is always kind of looking to where are the advanced industries that are going to kind of push our move our own domestic economy moving forward and I mean for example let's take a look at robotics one of the things that's very interesting is is when we look at the population in China and we look at the forecast for the future this is a very interesting trend and you know what's what's actually happening you look at China right now 1.4 billion people well China also has one of the oldest populations and has a very low birth rate so what you're going to see in the next 75 years okay by the time 2100 comes up by the end of this century you know you're going to see China's population roughly go from 1.4 4 billion down to around 750 to 800 million. So I mean they're going to lose around 600 million people as terms of population, right?

### ⚡ セクション 47

It's going to be under a billion people by the end of this century. So a big thing that people are saying is look, China's not going to have the workforce to actually be building stuff anymore, right? They're not going to have the people to be able to work in those factories. But then you kind of counter that and you say, well, we're preparing for that because we're also leading in in robots, right? you know, we're we're we're leading the world in robot, you know, deployment and how we're using robots.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Uh there are certain car factories, for example, that operate 24/7 in China and they actually don't have lights on because they're just they're all robotic, right? So, you don't need lights on. They just they work 24/7 and it's just robots, you know, actually manufacturing, you know, and assembling the cars. So I think you have you know you can kind of see one of the things that China does very well and again this is an advantage to a one party state is when you're looking at you know what is our plans you know 5 10 15 20 years down the line where do we want to go um as we get towards this new year 2026 coming up in just a few months you know China is revealing its next fifth year plan so China is very famous they have a five they always have the government launches a five-year plan and so this is the 15th or I think this is the 15th consecutive five-year plan that the Chinese government will release. And what's very good is it it's actually a kind of a big event in China, you know, because actually a lot of people kind of look forward to say like, all right, what what is the government going to accomplish these next 5 years?

### 🎬 セクション 49

And there's there's kind of a checks and balances there because, you know, they, you know, after the last 5 years, we want to say, okay, well 5 years ago, we told you we're going to do this. Well, now let's kind of follow up on that. Let's see what we did. You know, did we actually accomplish those goals? You know, how have we been doing?

### 📋 セクション 50

And China's government's very strategic in that way. you know they're very they're you know there's there's an interesting saying is that you know if you look at the US and China uh China is run by engineers and you know the United States is run by lawyers and so when you have this kind of engineering background you know if if you actually look at the you know the um you know the communist party of China and you look at the poly bureau which is the top nine guys right which obviously includes the president Xi Jinping but all of these guys have extensive you know degrees they have uh you know engineering background I mean these are very well educated And many of them have spent time, you know, getting master's degrees in the United States. Like they speak an incredible level of English. These are very intelligent men that have a tremendous diplomatic uh experience, you know, and so when you actually can kind of compare them to their American counterparts, it's very different because in America, you know, you don't really need to have any experience. You know, you can in America, let's be honest, it's a popularity contest.

### ⭐ セクション 51

You could be someone like Trump that doesn't have uh the actual political experience, but obviously he has the charisma. He has the ability to sell himself. He's an excellent marketer. And at the end of the day, he won the election, right? He was able to convince American people that, hey, I want to be the next president and I'm going to do a good job.

### 📝 セクション 52

People bought into that. He was elected. So, it's a very different system. And so, I think that's that's where uh, you know, again, we're looking at these advantages and and what, you know, what China is planning for the future. So, I'm I'm very much looking forward to this next 5-year plan to see, you know, what China is going to do and what they want to do.

### 💡 セクション 53

But I think the key thing here gentlemen is it's always we have to remember that China is planning for the long term looking at the trends looking at where the industry wants to go. This is why for example you look at renewable energy. China is very very big on renewable energy which is quite an interesting thing when we talk about AI because we actually look at you know this is going to be a major issue for the United States is the power grid right our power grid in the United States is not compatible for long-term AI development when you look at how stagnant the growth of electricity is in the country and China's just been going up because they you know they actually you know have invested heavily in all of these renewable energies and they can they dominate solar dominate wind turbines dominate hydro all of these things and so their power generation is through the roof Oh yeah, because most of the time when I talk to somebody they say like why should we worry about green energy when China is just polluting but you're telling me that's not the case? >> Oh I mean honestly you know there's well it's definitely I don't want to paint China as this country that doesn't pollute. I mean there's definitely still a lot of pollution but actually if you look at a per capita basis and what what's happening actually the United States would be a bigger poller.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So if you actually look at the uh the carbon emissions you know for the country and how many people are there and you look at the fact that you know does China still b burn coal absolutely there's still coal burning factories that you know exist and and coal producing you know let's say power plants but they are absolutely uh leading in all of these renewable energies. Uh interesting side story I did a video a few months ago uh talking about a new dam that is going to be built in the Tibetan mountains. Now, this BA dam is one of the most uh difficult projects that that will ever be built because of the remote location. You know, it's up in the Himalayan mountains near Tibet. I mean, you can think about the logistics of getting equipment, building this thing is going to be impossible.

### 🎯 セクション 55

But if there's one country in the world that's going to have the tooling, the engineering, the manpower to get this done, it's going to be China. By the time this is completed, this one dam will be able to produce enough energy from this one dam that that is equivalent to the entire United Kingdom's energy output for a year. So, you know, you're basically going to be able to produce that amount of power from one location in Tibet. And so, you know, from a hydro dam. So, it's going to be um it's going to be like the three gorges dam that you might have heard of, you know, the huge hydro dam out in West China.

### 💭 セクション 56

So, it's going to be an even bigger, even better, even more ambitious project. China broke ground about 2 months ago on that project and that will be completed. And so, yeah, I mean, when you look at uh the wind turbines, electric, I mean, it's it's quite impressive how um much China has changed. You know, I first went there in 2007, gentlemen, and you know, that that time was so different. You know, the pollution was horrific.

### 📌 セクション 57

I mean, it was just I remember days being in Shanghai where the pollution was so thick you could not see the color of the traffic lights, right? You could not see if it was red or green because of the smog and the pollution. And to say to show how much that's transformed, and a lot of it is, you go on the streets and 60% of the cars are EVs, right? You know, I mean, you know, I I would say within 5 to 10 years, you might not even see the the the gas cars anymore because the because the electric cars are becoming so popular and they're so nice and it's just it's so much better as far as, you know, reducing smog, pollution, things like that. >> Yeah, that's Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 58

And for people that are I've shown the chart on this um channel before where the production in of of electricity in China is just Yeah. Like you said, like goes up and up and up. I think it's I forget it's 10x or 5x something something like that times what what US produces and US is more or less stagnant since the year 2000s since the late 90s. >> Yeah. >> Um >> so I guess any idea any thoughts about that?

### 📚 セクション 59

Like what does the US have to do to catch up or just start you know ramping up our energy production? cuz I mean right now it seems like we're we're we're already seeing a massive crunch with you know the amount of uh data centers that all these companies are now racing to put out. They're talking about >> what 10 gawatt plants etc 100 etc. So like what what's US doing? Why can't we catch up and do you see that changing etc.

### 🔖 セクション 60

>> Well I think right now I mean you know this is why it's so interesting with the with the US politics because you know we have Donald Trump who is really doubling down on fossil fuels. you know, Donald Trump is not a fan of, you know, renewable energy. I mean, for example, he just ended the tax credit for electric vehicles, you know, in the United States. So, there was a big push by from Tesla, right? You know, get, you know, get your new Tesla or order your Tesla before September 30th, you know, to get that $7,500 federal tax credit that's now been eliminated.

### 🎨 セクション 61

And, you know, I mean, he wants to double down on, you know, fossil fuels and oil and and and, you know, basically the energy sources of the past. And so I think, you know, this is kind of again, you know, you know, and I don't want to sound like I'm I'm trying to praise China's government that they're they're more superior or better than the United States. I'm just trying to point out the differences. You know, this is something where, you know, why China, for example, if they're moving forward as one party state saying, "Look, we we're investing in renewable energy. This is the future, right?

### 🚀 セクション 62

Power grids are going to be important. Data centers are going to need to be built. We need as much energy as possible, so it makes sense. Why not build that hydro dam in the Tibetan mountains? Why not?" invest in solar panels.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Why not build wind turbines all over the country to to tap into these natural renewable energy? Um there's I think if we look at nuclear energy, there's around 25 nuclear power plants under construction right now in China. So I mean there's no other country in the world that are building like the Chinese. Actually they just had their first you know model uh they of of the thorium the molten is it it's called like the thorium molten reactor. So they have now have that one as well that has launched.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So, I mean, you know, it's that this is why I really like to study China because I always say this on my podcast is that, you know, China is inventing the future technology that's going to change our world. And so, I'm very bullish on that. You know, I think it's fantastic. And when you go there and you experience it, you really realize like, wow, like China is really doing some impressive stuff. And again, I kind of goes this kind of goes full circle here to your earlier question.

### 🎬 セクション 65

You know, is China doing this because they want to dominate the world? Are they doing this trying to position themselves and their country in a better future? you know what's what's happened a lot in China and what's really what's what's when Deep Sea came out earlier this year this was a very big thing for Chinese people like it's a it's a source of pride you know when I when I first went to China in 2007 Chinese people would never buy Chinese products right they didn't want to buy let's say a Chinese car because it's like well I I don't want a Chinese car I want an American car I want a European car because it's a status symbol it's a prestige symbol right you would have you know people would go to Starbucks back in 2007 and they would buy, you know, a five or six star latte. And they would hold it out with the Starbucks logo out so everyone can be like, "Hey, I'm paying, you know, premium money for this American brand because like I want you to know I've got money. It's a status symbol." Like that was a big thing of the culture, right?

### 📋 セクション 66

You wanted to wear Nikes. You wanted to have an Apple phone. You know, you wanted everything to be American or foreign. You know, German brands always did really well. Why?

### ⭐ セクション 67

Because Germans German products are always um, you know, attributed with high quality, right? We always know the Germans do things very well. So if it's like, "Yeah, I just bought a Porsche." Well, German car, great. Engineering, awesome. Quality, fantastic.

### 📝 セクション 68

But all that shifted, right? Everything shifted. So now you have local brands, right? Like Starbucks. They at one point about, this is in 2017, there was an article that came out on CNBC.

### 💡 セクション 69

You know, Starbucks was opening a new store in China every 15 hours. Okay? A new Starbucks every 15 hours. It it was it was gang busters. They were Starbucks was a great stock to own for many years because of the China play.

### 🔧 セクション 70

You go to Starbucks now in China, you can still find some busy Starbucks, but a lot of them are struggling because the domestic market is caught up. Chinese are saying, "Why am I paying why am I paying five bucks for a latte? There's Chinese brands that actually make a better latte and it's half the price, maybe a third of the price." And so, it's actually like, "I want to buy local. I want to buy Chinese." And so that's that's where we've seen a big shift in China as well is that the domestic consumer is all about buying Chinese products now. So when you have like a deepseek moment came out that was like a huge thing for the nation.

### 🎯 セクション 71

People were like man this is awesome. Like look at our engineers being able to develop something like that. Like we're we're coming up at the same level of the US. I mean this is this is as good if not better than open AI. That's a huge testament to our engineers.

### 💭 セクション 72

That's a huge testament to our government. That's a huge testament to our nation. And that's kind of the sentiment that they they feel. H what um but by the way like we'll have to talk about the thorium thing another time but I don't know if you know Wes but it's such a cool technology it's like going to be the power of nuclear without the risk and the US pioneered so much of that technology then we let go of it and China decided to build out and I don't know it just seems like the right future I mean I'd love the idea of nuclear power but not having the risk involved so um but maybe we could switch the conversation to Tik Tok so obviously it's uh kind of big news I guess that it's sort of sold and partially like some of the servers are in the US but it's still kind of not ours a little bit of uh algorithmic changes that we can see now should be important it doesn't see from what I understand in China there is no Facebook there is no um uh X or any of the American brands what do you think about how we kind of have some of their social networks here and we have in the past but they haven't allowed ours to be there >> so that's a great question and I've got a lot of experience on this. So I'm happy to chat about this.

### 📌 セクション 73

So the interesting thing about this is that China has a very strict policy on the data information. Okay. And so what's there's actually a big misconception here. A lot of people think that China has banned these companies from being there, right? Facebook, Twitter or X um you know all of these social media platforms.

### ✅ セクション 74

In reality they haven't banned them. is the simple fact is is that for example if you have an if you have Facebook is wants to operate in China the local Chinese rule is is that the data information has to be stored on servers in China no different than what the United States is asking right now right the United States says hey if you're Tik Tok and you want to operate here all of the data from the users has to be stored on servers in the United States it's literally the same policy from both countries now of course Facebook said well we're not building servers in China and we're not storing our information in China so okay well then you can't be here so you're banned you know, so it's either like you comply with the local rules or you don't. Now, here's an interesting case study. LinkedIn for many years said, "Okay, we're in like we're going to we're going to build servers there and we're going to store our information there because we would actively like to be in China." So, for many years, LinkedIn was the one social network that actually was able to be in China. Now, LinkedIn ended up pulling out of China, I'm going to say about three years ago.

### 📚 セクション 75

And the simple thing was is that it just didn't it couldn't make money there. It just could not it just never became popular. there wasn't a really a good growth market for them. And the thing is is that we have to remember with China is that and I use Chinese social media apps. So, you know, when you are a native Chinese speaker and you have Chinese social media apps, they're built in a much different way.

### 🔖 セクション 76

And and the easiest way I can say that is is that if you if the three of us are using Instagram, it's built for the American consumer, right? It's in English. It's it's fun. Like the interface is just built for us. China, you know, they have a different way.

### 🎨 セクション 77

So again, like it's hard to just say like, "Hey, we have Facebook. Just translate everything from English to Chinese and just launch it in China." It doesn't work that way, right? So China has their own apps that they develop and they have unique Chinese features. Um, you know, and and so for example, they have like different emojis. They have different um, you know, different features that, you know, how you can share things and how you can interact with your friends in like in a much different Chinese way.

### 🚀 セクション 78

So, it's it's kind of it's it's like how how can Facebook like how are we, you know, let's just say the three of us, you know, you know, even me, like I speak Chinese, but I don't know how to build an app that's going to really cater to Chinese people, right? Like a Chinese guy's got to do that, right? Or a Chinese woman engineer, like some somebody with that deep intimate connection that knows what the Chinese user really wants. They're going to have to build that. So, as far as those, you know, Western companies, I think there's an interesting one as well because, um, Mcronone, the French president, he said a very interesting quote this week.

### ⚡ セクション 79

And I don't know if you guys caught this. I'm going to say he said, "We actually had a really, we made a very poor decision that we actually allowed these social media companies from both the United States and China into France because, you know, we we've given all our control to them." So he kind of called out China and Tik Tok but he also called out obviously the United States which is very big in the United in France you know because people are using Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp and so you know this is actually you know when we talk about national security and you want to talk about the risk I mean I always like to look at it on the other way too you know because like all of Europe for example is basically you know all of their information is stored on US servers right and so you kind of look at you know the amount of leverage that the US has over Europe and it's kind of shocking And it was kind of amazing to hear France's president say that like I really regret that we have all these social media platforms in France and they're all controlled by the US government and then you know the Tik Tok thing. So as far as the Tik Tok deal, I'll answer that question. You know I think it's an interesting one because you know there's you know there's a whole debate on the algorithm right like who's controlling the algorithm, what's happening. Um you know the the interesting thing is is I I definitely don't support a Tik Tok ban.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Um, I think that, you know, I think for the majority of Tik Tok users, I don't think they really care if it's um, you know, okay, you know, this is from China, you know, like what is it? It's like, you know what, the interesting thing is is that China actually did manufacture something that was able to compete. I mean, actually, if you go to um, is the is the CEO of Bite Dance that owns Tik Tok, you know, the story about this is quite fascinating. You know, back, you know, when this would have been 10 years ago, more maybe longer. I mean, he he actually sat down with his with his team of friends in in in like a two-bedroom apartment in Beijing, and he said, "I want to build a social media platform, but I want it to be big." Like, I want to actually take on Facebook.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Like, I actually want to it to be a global brand. Because you can develop a domestic social media company in China and you have a and it's a very lucrative market because you got 1.4 billion people. So, you can totally tap that market and make, you know, millions of dollars, no problem. Billions of dollars. But you know to say I want to have Tik Tok really become a global brand that was a great vision from you know Dangin you know to really go out and and you know accomplish that and that and that was why they actually structured into two different versions.

### 📋 セクション 82

So I'm sure you know there's two versions of Tik Tok. There's one that's called Tik Tok which is around the world. There's a domestic Chinese version called Dowine and Dowin is the one that operates exclusively in China and they do that because of the different internet laws right there's certain content that you can't put in China. there's certain internet laws, you know, to in order to operate in China. So, that's that's the difference between the two.

### ⭐ セクション 83

>> Yeah. I thought it was amazing that they shut down all the large language models for there's some sort of a national sort of uh exam day where students, college students, university. >> Yeah. And they so shut down the equivalent I mean every Chad GPT and Deepseek and whatever. Uh so it would not be used during that time that I was like wow that's crazy.

### 📝 セクション 84

And I think Tik Tok, their version of Tik Tok does not allow something about targeting kids so that they keep studying. Just don't don't show them stupid content, I guess. >> So, well, what's really good? So, I actually went on Piers Morgan about a year a year and a half ago. I was on his show and we and I was I was debating about Tik Tok and I said there I said, "Pice, this is a really interesting thing.

### 💡 セクション 85

You might actually like this." So, in China, everybody has to register, you know, your ID card, you know, to your social media platform. So it's it's direct it be equivalent to like typing in your driver's license in order to sign up for Facebook or Instagram. Okay? So you have a record and so they know you know who's behind the brand and who's behind this etc. So if you're under the age of 18 you know you have your ID card you have to get if you want to have your own phone and your own thing.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Well if you're under the age of 18 you're limited. They actually limit it to 60 minutes a day. And so their big debate is is that you know the guy that I was debating he was a member of parliament and he said this is terrible. you know, this is the government cracking down on freedom, you know, and and and and I said, well, I said, you're not wrong, you know, you're not wrong that it is certainly cracking down on freedom, but at the end of the day, as a parent, you know, you're probably not upset that you're, you know, if you have an 11 12y old kid, I mean, should they be doing more than 60 minutes a day? I mean, you could make the argument that that should be the parents responsibility, but let's be honest, in today's age, a lot of parents aren't around.

### 🎯 セクション 87

And so, all of a sudden, you you and so that's actually appears it's like, you know, Cyrus, you might be on to something here. like that's not a that's not a bad idea. It's something to explore. It's something to have a a chat about. And so again, you know, the the other gentleman that was debating, he was like, "No, no, no.

### 💭 セクション 88

That's authoritarian. That's terrible. There's no freedom." And it was just more like, "Huh, that's kind of an interesting thing." And I've actually talked to a lot of parents here in Las Vegas. I've got three kids myself. We're all at school.

### 📌 セクション 89

And so I tell this to all the parents and they're like, "That's a brilliant idea." Like I I nine nine out of 10 parents I talk to, they're like, "Oh, I love that idea." Right? like, you know, to talk about teenage kids and how often they're on these social media platforms. If you got locked out, you got 60 minutes a day. I mean, that's that's not a bad thing. Uh, you know, so again, it's we can have a debate on is it authoritarian?

### ✅ セクション 90

Is it overstepping your freedoms? It's just an interesting perspective. But yes, that is how it works in China. And and it's exactly so the GACO, just so people don't know, the GACO is equivalent to it's your college entrance test. It is like the biggest test you ever take in China.

### 📚 セクション 91

It literally determines if you get in or out of college and it's like a two or three day examination depending on where you are in the country. Uh but yeah, people study their whole lives, you know, to take that test. And so, you know, if you pass the GCA and you're going to get into a big school, like ma, massive deal. >> Yeah, that's so wild because I mean the the idea I think about it in food sometimes like it's like in the US sometimes there's just like really crappy food, right? Like we allow certain things in our food production line that China would have never allowed.

### 🔖 セクション 92

But then again, it's also like I guess the freedom to eat garbage like that you want to debate and I'm like I don't know. I don't know where to draw the line on that. >> Yeah. No, you know, I mean, we're getting a little off topic, but I think it's I think it's relevant. I mean, so I lived in Canada for 5 years and so what's interesting is in Canada, the amount of things banned from the United States is shocking.

### 🎨 セクション 93

I mean, you just can't believe it. A simple example would be Froot Loops. So, you look at Froot Loops and and all of those are artificial coloring in the American version. Well, Froot Loops in Canada, they have a completely different version. It's all made with natural organic uh you know, for example, red that comes from uh beetroot, right?

### 🚀 セクション 94

So, they they take the beetroot extract and they dye it. So, so you know, the Froot Loops in Canada, they're a much more duller color. They're not that bright shiny red. It's more of a it's a beetroot color. So, it's a kind of like a washed out purple, if you will.

### ⚡ セクション 95

But, it's obviously healthy. It's organic. It's it's definitely not a toxic chemical. And so, you know, that's I I'm totally there, especially with a father of three children. You know, we're we're looking at labels for our kids and it's like when we're in Canada, we always love that because it's like, oh yeah, you could grab some Froot Loops because those aren't bad for you, but then it's like, oh yeah, look at the American version.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Yellow five, red 40, blue one. You know, you don't want to be putting that garbage in your body. >> Yeah, the cost, it's just the cost of freedom requires so much education and so much effort. You know what I mean? And like I think we sometimes forget that as Americans.

### 🎬 セクション 97

like yeah we do have more freedom but we have to now choose to eat the healthier thing and not be convinced by the marketing that red five is worth buying and boycott against it and >> yeah totally you know 100% 100% with you there >> um maybe we could talk about the uh uh world artificial intelligence conference that you recently attended so I guess this would be the equivalent of something like CES in China or maybe even bigger than that but it's really where you get a sense to walk the floor see the companies and get a beat for where the most advanced AI in the country is what did you learn from that event? How can you compare it to like kind of what we know in the US? >> Yeah, I mean so I would say that uh Dylan that's a great question. Uh so it it is actually held uh every year in Shanghai. Uh it was it was a great time to go.

### 📋 セクション 98

Um so it's the world AI conference and a couple takeaways that I had is that number one, you know, one of the things that we often hear in in Western media is is that China's collapsing. The the economy is struggling right now. You know, you go to that World AI conference and I'm not kidding, there must have been three or 400,000 people there. I mean, it was jam-packed in that area. I mean, it was wall-to-wall people.

### ⭐ セクション 99

There was a huge There's kind of a there's amazing time to be in China because at at exhibitions like this, there's a there's a tremendous energy in the room because you're just surrounded by so many people, right? And so, for example, the the big thing was really the robotics, right? So, you had the Unitary uh robotics and they had robot they had robots all over the the store. So, it is kind of or the the the show floor, I should say. So, it was kind of interesting cuz like everywhere you're going, you know, you're seeing these robots walking down the aisle, you know, they're, you know, people are taking pictures with them.

### 📝 セクション 100

They, you know, you go for a coffee. Um, you know, it's a it's a robotic barista making you a latte. You know, it's it's like uh there's, you know, to scan the QR code to get into this place. It's you're interacting with a robot. It's just like, wow.

### 💡 セクション 101

It's like, gez, it's kind of like a little thing of the future here. Like, there's just robots everywhere. And then of course the cool thing was is they really wanted to show you how advanced these robots are getting. So they had two of these uh unitry robots, you know, do a boxing match. And so that was a, you know, they had a full boxing ring set up.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Uh, and that was really the big draw. I mean, there was just tons of people around this. Everybody wanted to take a look at that. And and you're just kind of people are asking, you know, like, well, what's the point of, you know, you know, two robots boxing, but it's talking about, you know, how they're able to move. You're watching the footwork.

### 🎯 セクション 103

You're watching it like if somebody gets hit, how they fall down, how they get back up. And it's like, wow, you know, that range of motion for this robot is pretty incredible. You know, I mean, I do think that there will come a time where, you know, for example, there's going to be a robot in your home and doing laundry, folding laundry, and doing things like this. I mean, you know, is it within the next year, two years? I don't know.

### 💭 セクション 104

But I do see that in our future. And so again, you're you're kind of seeing uh they had production lines, you know, where where it's like, okay, in our factories here here are robots where they're sorting out, you know, for example, piles of trash, you know, where it's like, okay, this is paper, this is plastic, this is um, you know, cardboard, and, you know, and you're just watching these robots move and able to determine what the materials are and then be able to sort them into their respective piles on the fly. I was like, wow, that's that's pretty amazing, you know. So, you're starting to see that. Um, I spent some time at the 10-cent booths, which is again, you know, one of China's big tech companies.

### 📌 セクション 105

And so they had built, you know, all of these AI different models that were that were really cool. So the biggest one that I thought was really amazing is they had partnered with China Southern Airlines and they had built this entire flight simulator all built with AI and now China Southern pilots, they have to go through a thousand hours of training on those simulators, you know, before they're able to actually fly a real plane, you know. So again, it's, you know, I think this is very common. I mean, we're going to see AI obviously deployed in almost every industry, but again, it's just you you start seeing all of these, you know, different things that are built, you know, and all of these companies and people from around the world all going there. I think again, we go back to that that comment I made earlier as far as the elderly in China.

### ✅ セクション 106

there's going to be, you know, ro robots working in the elderly home, you know, helping people get out of bed, helping people to get to the restroom, you know, and and so there was there was like it's like, man, this is this is a pretty cool, you know, piece of technology. There was a another one was these robotic legs that you could actually basically strap up to your legs and you could actually, you know, move, you know. Yeah, you actually move. And and some they actually, well, interesting enough, they actually like deploy these at tourist sites. So, for example, if you've ever been to the Great Wall of China, those steps are extremely steep.

### 📚 セクション 107

It's actually a very I mean, even if you're, you know, you're you're in great shape, you're super fit, like you're climbing that Great Wall of China, like that's a workout. Like, you're going to be exhausted. So, they they're like, they sell you these robotic legs that you can just strap up and just help you move a little bit faster, you know, just to make that more efficient. So, it's it's pretty cool. I mean, I I I I always I you can see that I'm very excited about China.

### 🔖 セクション 108

I'm very bullish about China. I always encourage people like even if you hate China or you don't know anything about it like I would just encourage you to go there and experience in it just to kind of get a little bit of perspective just to kind of see you know what's going on over there because it's it's much more modern much safer much more futuristic than you probably would ever believe and I've never met a foreigner that's been to China and not come back and just been like wow that that really kind of exceeded my expectations. That really blew me away. It was nothing like I thought it would be. That's really the the most common thing I've heard, especially in the last couple of years.

### 🎨 セクション 109

You know, um you know, if you if you went to China once in 1995, then you know, it's basically a entirely different country now. Uh you know, I mean, it's you've got to go within, you know, if you haven't been within the last couple years, it's it's totally different. >> It's amazing when they post certain videos online. Like just today, this morning, I think somebody posted like here's a Chinese uh train station. I forget the name, but I was like, what?

### 🚀 セクション 110

This isn't some futuristic movie I'm watching. Sorry. Did you say the name? >> Um, it's actually the So, that's that's that video has been going viral on Twitter. I know exactly the one you're talking about.

### ⚡ セクション 111

It's It's the world's largest train station. Just opened in Chongqing. Um, yeah, it's been it's been trending. And there's And they also just opened up the world's largest bridge as well, which is um been trending on Twitter as well. So, and and I think there's a tough one because I saw, for example, I saw the you remember the Baltimore Bridge that collapsed, what was it 18 months ago?

### 🌟 セクション 112

So they they're they showed the status of that being rebuilt. They're driving the first pylon into the water right now to help the rebuild. And it's like, okay, well, China just built the world's largest bridge. They did it for a budget of $300 million and they completed it from scratch in 48 months. And it's like what what's going on in Baltimore?

### 🎬 セクション 113

Like what are we doing? So again, like again, I'm not trying to say like US is bad, China's good. It's just more I think what the the sentiment on Twitter is is like why can't we get our stuff together? Like we should be doing this here, right? Like we you know we were able to we built the Golden Gate Bridge in like 3 years I think like right like we we got the engineering I mean that and when was Golden Gate Bridge built you know 70 years ago 80 years ago you know so >> why is that I mean you you brought the question up just kind of chatting but like why like why is it do you think it's that we have four-year terms and nobody thinks long term or do you think the education system was built for the wrong era and it needs an overhaul or is it the competition between the provinces that we're missing?

### 📋 セクション 114

I a great question, Dylan. I mean, I think it's a little bit of all three of those. You know, I think when you look at um you know, the bureaucracy in the United States to get something done like, hey, we want to build a new bridge. You know, all of that, you know, I mean, you know that you can't get started on that project for how long? You know, 6 months to a year because you got to get the permitting.

### ⭐ セクション 115

You've got to get the plans. You've got to put it up to, you know, to the community. Let's have a vote about it. Let's do this. Let's do that.

### 📝 セクション 116

I mean, there's a lot of red tape in order to do that. Whereas, again, like in China, it's like we're building a bridge. Okay. like when are we starting? We're starting next month.

### 💡 セクション 117

Okay, great. Like that's let's get the plans together and get it done. You talk about the this the skill set there there's a viral interview that I love um because for example it's it's from Tim Cook, CEO of Apple and he said he said in an interview he said a lot of people misunderstand China. They think that we go to China to manufacture because it's cheap. Actually it's not cheap.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Like China is much more expensive than people think it is to manufacture, especially when you're doing products like an iPhone. He said, 'We actually go to China because of the tooling engineers. He said, 'If I go in the United States right now and try to find the most advanced tooling engineers, I would find I would be lucky to fill a classroom of them. I can go to China, I could fill multiple football fields filled with these tooling engineers. He's like, that's why we're in China because of that ability and the and these people that could do that work.

### 🎯 セクション 119

And so there's there's it's an amazing you know it's an amazing thing when you actually look at um you know how the ch again the China system and how they're able to you know again how are they able to close that gap you know when I when I started my geopolitics YouTube channel a few years ago I mean the g again the gap between China and the United States and chips was miles I mean it was years you know it's like we could we we literally have a 5year head start on China and in I mean you guys know this I mean in order to close that gap I mean how do you close that gap five years is an eternity. And that's exact that was the quote from Eric Schmidt. 5 years is an eternity in my mind, right? And that was his famous thing like US has the lead. 5 years is an eternity.

### 💭 セクション 120

That was his exact quote. And then now it's just like um yeah, China's like now you have Jensen Hong saying, "Yeah, China is nanconds behind." Like they've they're closing that gap and they're they're, you know, getting faster and better at at doing this. So I think, you know, when it when it comes down to it, I think it's a little bit of everything. It's a little bit of red tape in the government, little bureaucracy issues. You've got I don't think you have the engineering and the the people to do that.

### 📌 セクション 121

I mean this is why this this H1N visa is a very big deal because you don't have you know you know you know look at look at Silicon Valley. Look at how many of these engineers come from foreign countries. I mean we don't have them here. You know it's not like we're it's not like Americans are being forced out of jobs. You know it's not like we're firing you know able American engineers and then we're bringing in cheaper labor.

### ✅ セクション 122

Like we don't have the people to do that. you know, Silicon Valley was built on, you know, immigration and these H1N visas. >> Yeah. Uh yeah. So, that's definitely one thing that's that's interesting to note, like you just said, how many just sheer number of of STEM people coming out of certain countries.

### 📚 セクション 123

Um and China's probably, I'm sure, like the leading by far. So, the other thing you sometimes talk about is kind of where the different countries are besides China, besides US. Like for example recently um you know we saw Jason Hang, Elon Musk, Sam Alman, Donald Trump and all the the cabinets all all the people helping him. They all went to the United Arab Emirates talking to um the leaders there and seemingly saying that that's going to be much bigger alliance so to speak. they're going to be much closer US and uh the kingdom as they as they refer to it and they want to build the infrastructure on US tech the world infrastructure for AI uh and instead of letting China build that out so I'm curious like just for people that maybe don't follow the geopolitics maybe don't really understand it like what's the top level thing of like where does India fall into that where where's US India United Arab Emirates China like how's everybody sort of positioned in this case.

### 🔖 セクション 124

Yeah, that's a great question, Wes. So, I think what's interesting here is I I mentioned this a little bit is that we have this now multipolar world where the United States is not the sole superpower. So, the US was the sole superpower after World War II. And I would argue that really up until like kind of the mid1 1990s, I would say the United States had a very nice almost half ccentury time where, you know, we're number one, you know, and and no one was close. You could make an argument that maybe the Soviet Union was a potential, you know, threat to that, but Soviet Union was never an economic threat.

### 🎨 セクション 125

It was maybe a military threat, but it never, you know, could compete with the United States in that regard. But the rise of China is certainly something that has challenged that US hijgemony because now countries have an option. And so now they can actually, you know, figure out who they want to work with. And I think what we've seen with Donald Trump and his trade war and his presidency so far, at least during Trump 2.0, but also in Trump 1.0, know is, you know, with these trade wars, these are actually often times very disruptive to the United States economy. Great example of this is if you look at the farming industry right now, soybean farmers, corn farmers, if you go talk to them right now, I mean, they're hurting big time here because what's happened is is that they had a very lucrative opportunity in the United States.

### 🚀 セクション 126

You know, 40% of the soybeans grown in this country has to be exported abroad, right? We we we produce way more than we can possibly consume. We don't need soy products in the United States. It's not a big thing for us, right? We eat beef, we eat chicken, you know, we we eat certainly more meat products.

### ⚡ セクション 127

So, we obviously, but we have one of the most fertile lands in the world in order to grow these products, right? So, we had a great relationship, right? China bought all of the soybeans. All of these soybean farmers made tons of money. But because of the trade war, you know, and and the way that, you know, Trump was, you know, positioning against China, China said, "Look, you don't forget we're the number one trading partner with many countries around the world.

### 🌟 セクション 128

We have options, right?" So, for example, we're going to call up Argentina, Brazil, they have tons of soybeans, fantastic quality. We can we can we can bring those in as well. You know, when when China when Donald Trump started putting a tariff on Brazilian coffee um exporters, right? The Brazilian beans now subject to, you know, a nearly 45% tariff. Well, no one's going to buy Brazilian beans at 45% tariff, right?

### 🎬 セクション 129

Don't forget, it's us that is buying the products, right? US importers, we are paying the tariffs. So, all of a sudden, you know, Brazilian imports to the United States plummeted. Well, China said, "Don't worry, all you guys come to here because China is one of the fastest growing coffee drinkers." So, there's a great opportunity, you know, for them. So, I I think, you know, and and back to your question as far as the United Arab Emirates, you know, where are all these people going?

### 📋 セクション 130

I always like to say that I I like to say that again, I'm a big I'm a big I've been a longtime shareholder in Nvidia. Uh no, no. Uh uh this is not investment advice, but you know, just just disclosure, but I mean, like I think it's a great company, right? They I think that they produce great products. I think China's producing great things.

### ⭐ セクション 131

I think what we need to look at is we need to look at areas that we can all compete. Um you know actually if you go to the United Arab Emirates their entire 5G network is built by Huawei. So I mean you know that they have some of the most advanced 5G there and Huawei absolutely dominates in the Middle East. So you know you have a very interesting thing where you know actually when you look at Huawei as a company they have absolutely dominated across the world. you know they out of I think out of um the top 50 telecom companies in the world uh 40 of them are working directly with Huawei in some capacity.

### 📝 セクション 132

So you know they have a a massive global reach actually if you look at the continent of Africa the most of the 5G and uh espec certainly the 3G and 4G you know they're basically their network was all built by China you know so again this is where China is looking at you know what we call is the global south so the global south is Latin America Africa the Middle East Southeast Asia the you know 85% of the world lives in the global south right when you look at these North American countries like obviously North America Europe you we we include Australia in this global north. Um you know that's only 15% of the population. So there's actually a huge opportunity in that global south. And so again, you know, you're looking at I think I think both countries can develop great tech. I think both countries can develop great hardware and you're just going to see, you know, both of them are going to have a lot of leverage, you know, moving forward in the future.

### 💡 セクション 133

>> Absolutely. >> Gotcha. Uh Wes, is there any like final kind of questions you wanted to throw out there or anything? >> This was incredibly good. I the few questions that I was very curious and it getting answered I think we definitely nailed it.

### 🔧 セクション 134

Is there anything that maybe we've missed especially at that intersection of development of chips AI robotics like what maybe anything that any myths you want to dispel or anything that we haven't covered or anything that's just of interest to you that maybe we've missed >> you know I I I just want people to understand I'm just going to leave you with this final thought guys. So first of all I really appreciate the the invite to your channel. Yeah, it's it's my pleasure. And you know, I have a YouTube channel that I talk about China and I talk about geopolitics. And this channel started 5 years ago during COVID because I was very frustrated with the way that China was presented uh in the media.

### 🎯 セクション 135

I think that there's a lot of positive stories from coming out of China. There's a lot of incredible tech. I'll tell you an interesting story. China's Chinese scientists actually invented a new bone glue. I don't know if you heard about this story.

### 💭 セクション 136

Okay. So they actually took the they took the the the same technology that actually from oysters. You know how oysters actually attach themselves to something. They have this actual secretion of a glue. They actually made a glue that can actually heal fractures.

### 📌 セクション 137

They can actually go in there, use this glue, and they can heal a fracture completely within like 2 days. And so it's it's like this amazing thing. Chinese scientists, they actually developed a cure uh in clinical trials right now for curing type 1 diabetes. Um you know, they're they're moving the needle on. so many of these things and and this is something that you know I want people to understand is that even in our medical industry in the United States this is a really crucial point I want people to understand when you look at the best American pharmaceutical companies the best American doctors and what they're doing in and pharmacists and and and and doctors in these industries they actually do a lot of those clinical trials in China and the reason for that is because of the sample size right China has four times the population so when you're looking at like say how do we treat this advanced disease Well, actually, let's go to China because four times the population, you're going to have four times as many patients with that disease.

### ✅ セクション 138

And so, actually, there's a tremendous amount of collaboration between the US and China when you really get to the details. So, I just want my I just want my final message is, you know, don't sleep on China. Do more research about it and really become curious because this is a multipolar world. China's not going anywhere. It will be a superpower and it will be a big force in the future of our world.

### 📚 セクション 139

So, I would advise everybody to educate yourself about it. educate yourself more about China and what they're doing. And if you haven't already, book a trip to China. I mean, just go there as a tourist. Uh there's now 45 countries around the world that are visa-free depending on your uh your passport.

### 🔖 セクション 140

Even for US passport holders, uh you can get a 10-day transit visa. So that means you can fly into one city. Let's say you fly into Beijing, you can stay on the ground in China for 10 days and then fly out of a different city. So let's say you fly go to Beijing, fly out of Shanghai, you don't even need a visa. You can you can literally just go and take by book a flight there.

### 🎨 セクション 141

But I would say just I would encourage people to really le learn more about China. Go experience it and it it will change how you see the world. >> Yeah. And that's that's great. Very well said.

### 🚀 セクション 142

And certainly now that as the AGI race is heating up, I think more of us wherever you are in the world, I think it's important to understand that uh where everybody is, how everything is progressing because I think this is going to be a very crucial sort of a technological race. And uh I'm certainly one person that does not want to see conflict. We we've seen these robots. We've seen how quickly they're progressing. We don't want to get into anything where there's military conflict.

### ⚡ セクション 143

Uh keep everything peaceful, get to know every everybody and the neighbors, etc. So, >> thank you so much for being here. This was an absolutely incredible interview. We'll leave all the links down below. Um I didn't know you started your channel in in in 2020.

### 🌟 セクション 144

I mean, that was quite an incredible growth. So, congratulations. you must have you you must be really um people are really finding value with it and I'm certainly going to try to learn more about China and uh kind of where things are going. So awesome Dylan. Thank you guys so much.

### 🎬 セクション 145

I appreciate you both.
