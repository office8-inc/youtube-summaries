## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

In July of 2013, a bizarre video game appeared online. It was called Kanye Quest 3030. And on the surface, it seemed like nothing more than a weird indie project made by a fan of hiphop. The premise was absurd. So, if you watch my videos for a while, you know I have last few years always trying to make this AI video production workflow work.

### 📋 背景・概要

And it's been with some success, but I think now we are really close to something perfect. Uh, I've been working on this over the weekend and it's just insane to be honest how good it's gotten since uh the last time I tried. So, I don't know if I'm going to go through all the steps here, but basically I can take this quick. So, this is the pool workflow. So, we have uh some source material and we're going to check the archive if we have done the story before just to check.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Extract extract uh MP3s files from the MP4 files and transcribe them into text using whisper. generate the video script, the voiceover script, send it to 11 Labs and we're going to ret transanscribe the voice over to get timestamps that we can compare with uh the clips and for that we need to generate the timeline generate AI images to fill in gaps in our video that is missing clips for so that we using nanob pro for that and we're going to process the clips we're going to compose the video again with ffmpeg generate some thumbnails and some data if we need that And yeah, we're going to archive the story so we know that we have already done this story. That's the final clip. And then we have the video fully able. We also have some background music and stuff.

### 📝 詳細説明

So I just want to show you how this works. Oops. I just want to show you how this works now and how good it has become with the opus cloud code and all of the other bunch of tools that is new. So yeah, let me just walk you through like a full workflow of this and we're going to see what kind of video we can generate. So the way I have been using this is trying to create clips from my own videos.

### 💡 実例・デモ

That has been my testing. But I wanted to show you a bit more interesting use case uh for the video. Yeah, because my videos are a bit boring for this. Uh I'm a big fan of the YouTube channel Chilling Scares. And he often has different stories inside his videos.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So I just got a copy of his video here, Disturbing Internet Mysteries that has been solved. I really recommend checking that out. So, uh, I put that into my video folder here on cursor. And that is basically all I want to do. Usually, I just put my own videos here, but I just want to show you kind of how this work with a bit more of interesting story.

### 🎯 応用例

Okay. So, what I can do now is I can go to claude and I can just do Yeah. Claude code. When I head into that, I am in my Yeah, cloud code here. I think you should see this.

### 💭 考察

Maybe do this. Okay, perfect. So we have something called custom commands. So I have created a custom command for my workflow. So I can quickly show you how this looks.

### 📌 まとめ

Now if we go to my custom command, you can see here we have all the steps. So your expert script writer writing exciting stories interesting to watch. Great hooks and pasting. And we have the step remember the image we had step 1 0 to 10. All of this is described in my slash command here in cloud code.

### ✅ 結論

So basically hopefully I can just press enter now and the full video workflow will be done autonomously. That's my goal. So let's see if we actually can do this now. So kind of what's going to happen now is uh this command is just going to follow everything we put into our instructions, right? So step zero to 10.

### 📚 追加情報

So you can see now it's kind of looking for what videos do we have. You can see we found the disturbing mysteries video that we put in. Okay, let's do this. So we're going to probe it to see the length. We're also going to check out what stories we have done in our archive.

### 🔖 補足

Okay, we probe the video. We found the length of it and the source video is about 27 minutes long. Check the storage. Uh we haven't archived yet. Okay, that's good.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So now we can just wait for that. So what we are doing now is we're taking the MP4 file and extracting only the audio because we only want the MP3 file to run with Whisper here to get the full transcription with the timestamps. Uh I'm going to show you how that looks when this is complete. Okay. So you can see that was completed.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Now we got 300 segments of transcription and we're going to check it out. So if we go in here, you can see the transcription here. Now this is I can zoom in a bit. So the first uh from second three till 9 we have this text on January 25th of January 2010 ready user ready user disco God godfather 692 made a post. So now we kind of get uh uh the start, the end and the text right.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So this is important when we are going to select here what kind of stories we want to do or when we can find clips because these clips also relate to the audio and what kind of clips are in the video we can do a yeah a clip from. Okay. So you can see now uh we are looking at kind of what stories we're going to pick. This is going to pick the Kanye West Kanye quest 330 story. Okay, this is what we're going to do.

### 🌟 セクション 16

The source run from uh Okay, so we're going to look at the original video. So, we just want to get the one uh ARG cult mystery story in this video game. Okay, perfect. So let's see what's going to do next is actually we're going to generate a voice over script uh that we are going to send to 11 labs to actually get our full story here. So yeah yes I want to do that.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Okay and here we have the full script. So it's nine uh how many seconds? 500 seconds that's about yeah you can see the full script here. So this is what we are sending to 11 labs. Perfect.

### 📋 セクション 18

generate voice over and we have like a set voice some generic voice I found and now we are running this script here Python code to actually generate the voiceover script we're going to do now when this script is over is that we need to retranscribed it if you remember this step here retranscribe voice over because we also need the timestamps uh for the new story right so it's 7 minutes and 20 seconds and now we're going to transcribe this again to get the time stamp amps for our voice over. Okay, so that was done. So now you can see the next up uh we're going to actually create the visual timeline we talked about. So this is the timeline where we want to look at um how we should put the story together based on the clips and the timestamps. And we also going to generate some I see we can do three AI images here to fit in the gaps we maybe are missing in our story.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Right? So we're going to do three images. Uh maybe that's at least three images. Okay. And these are going to be incorporated into the video.

### 📝 セクション 20

So yeah, let's just uh do this uh images and then we can move on. Okay. So our timeline is done. Uh we can look at how this looks now. So if we go in here, uh I think it's actually in uh so if you look at timeline now, you can see this is how we're going to do this.

### 💡 セクション 21

Um okay. So let me just check. Yeah, timeline. Okay. So you can see now we have our plan here.

### 🔧 セクション 22

We have a clip and where it starts, what kind of clip it is and it's a hook, right? 35 seconds and perfect. So that is kind of our timeline. 13 clips and four images. So now we're going to generate those images.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Okay. So I think our images is done. Now if we go in here and check the image folder. Yeah, we have four different images that we are going to use in our video here. They all kind of look the same.

### 💭 セクション 24

Perfect. Kanye Quest 3030. Perfect. So now it's basically starting to processing the clips. Uh this is quite boring.

### 📌 セクション 25

So I'm going to This is just an FFmpeg operation in two parts. So I'm just going to skip this for you and take you back when Yeah, that should be basically our video done now. So I just wanted to bring you back uh because we are now uh coming into the final part. We have actually uh clipped everything together. Uh the video editing is done by the AI.

### ✅ セクション 26

So that should be finished. And you can see we are at 17 minutes. So fully autonomously we are at 17 minutes. This took from start to finish. That is pretty incredible.

### 📚 セクション 27

And when you see the results now, you will kind of see what I mean. And this has completely changed how I do clips from my videos, right? It just saves me so much time. It does the video editing. It does the planning.

### 🔖 セクション 28

It comes up with a story. Uh so I can create different stories from my videos. Uh I create images to fill in the gaps we are missing. I can do background music as you will hear that I created soon. Uh I can get title suggestions.

### 🎨 セクション 29

The video game that was actually a cult recruitment tool. Okay, that's pretty interesting. We can get thumbnails. What thumbnails did they come up with for this uh video type? We get a description.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh, of course, this is an example, but for my video, this could be something else. So, these are the thumbnails it came up with. Uh, we have some Yeah, I don't like that. Do I like this thumbnail? I don't think so.

### ⚡ セクション 31

What about uh this? Nah, not the best. Uh, okay, that wasn't too bad. Uh, yeah. Okay, so the thumbnails could have some work here, but basically you get the idea.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And basically now I think all we have to do so we archive the story so we don't repeat this if uh I'm going to do some future videos uh on Yeah, of course not on this but on on my channel. So I think all we have to do now is just watch uh a minute or something of the completed video. Uh so you yeah know what Okay, perfect. So that was done. So, let's just watch a minute of it.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And yeah, I think you're going to like it. So, if we go here now, you can find the final video here. Uh, okay. So, uh, I'm going to open this in like a separate, uh, player, and I'm going to play you like 1 minute or something. Uh, I'm going to turn off my camera here.

### 📋 セクション 34

In July of 2013, a bizarre video game appeared online. It was called Kanye Quest 30030. And on the surface, it seemed like nothing more than a weird indie project made by a fan of hip hop. The premise was absurd. You played as Kanye West, who falls through a mysterious portal and wakes up in the year 3030.

### ⭐ セクション 35

In this dystopian future, America is ruled by a clone of rapper Lil B, who believes himself to be a god. The world is filled with clones of other famous rappers. Tupac, Jay-Z, Eminem. Your mission as the player is to assemble a team of these legendary artists, defeat Lil B, and save the country. It was strange.

### 📝 セクション 36

It was kind of funny and for a while people played it, laughed about it and moved on. The game even caught the attention of Video Game Dunkey, one of the most respected reviewers on YouTube. But like most indie games from that era, it eventually faded into obscurity. No one gave it a second thought until January 2015 when someone discovered what the game was really hiding. An anonymous user made a post on 8chan detailing a shocking discovery.

### 💡 セクション 37

At one point in the game, an NPC asked the player a simple question. What do you want to do? There's a sixletter blank space where you can type your response. Most players typed random words and moved on, but this user decided to type something different. Ascend.

### 🔧 セクション 38

The moment they hit enter, everything changed. The player >> Okay, so that was pretty good, right? Uh, I've been just so impressed over this weekend trying to figure out this pipeline. And I haven't really kind of comp comprehended what this really means for kind of my workflow yet. Uh, but I'm definitely going to keep exploring.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Also, I just wanted to mention you can see uh for the thumbnails uh it we extracted some frames from the video that we tried to use in the thumbnails, right? And with Nano Banana Pro, we can kind of take this. Yeah, you can see we could have used this uh to a new level. But what this means for my workflow and how I do video automation, I haven't kind of comprehended yet. But basically this is going to be a huge change because Opus 4.5 especially in claw code is so good at actually creating the stories, putting everything together, not making mistakes and the videos I've been doing has been just so good.

### 💭 セクション 40

They've been like very good production and the story and the clipping has been very interesting because the because Claude here it doesn't only do the clipping, it also do the planning. So, it kind of has the context of what the video is about and from that it writes a script based on that and it selects clips it wants to put into this to create tell the story. So, what I'm going to try out the next few days is bring in like a bunch of different videos and try to create an interesting story uh based on a lot of different sources. That is going to be my next project. So, if a lot of people like this video, I'm going to do a follow-up how that went.

### 📌 セクション 41

So yeah, hopefully this gave you some inspiration uh what you can do with the new Opus or with other tools. Yeah, just go out there and do crazy stuff because this is really getting really interesting. And I have a bunch of other video ideas I want to share too with things I've been doing lately. Uh one of them has made me a good chunk of money actually. I might share that too.

### ✅ セクション 42

Uh but yeah, thank you for tuning in. Like I said, hope this gave you some inspiration and I see you again uh soon.
