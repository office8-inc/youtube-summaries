## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I've been working at my computer for 12 hours a day for like years now. You code all day and all night and then your eyes started to hurt. So, I decided to fix [music] my lighting. I've been using the BenQ Halo light bar for years now. It clips on top of your monitor and lights your desk without hitting the screen.

### 📋 背景・概要

Staring at a bright screen in a dark room is basically torture for your eyes. And overhead lights create this glare that makes everything worse. But this fixes both. As my office has expanded over the years, things get switched in, switched out, you name it. But the Halo Light Bar is something I keep constantly [music] just because it's so good for my eyes, especially when I'm doing late night coding or video editing.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And my favorite upgrades of the Halo Light Bar 2 is the auto detection. When you leave or enter, it will either turn on or off automatically and a much wider lighting radius. I mean, let's be real, I couldn't stop working [music] late nights even if I tried. So, I worked with my brain rather than against it.
