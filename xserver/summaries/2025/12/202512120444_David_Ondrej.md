## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

In this video, I'm going to show you how to build an AI SAS from scratch and what's the cheapest and most reliable way to deploy it. And before we begin, what we need is a empty folder, which is what I have right here. So, I'm going to open that folder inside of cursor. And there we go. Now, we have a lot of options, right?

### 📋 背景・概要

We have codeex, cursor, cloth code, droid, many different coding agents, but right now I think one of the best is cloth code and especially after the release of Opus 4.5, which is the latest model from Enthropic. So if you don't have cloud code installed, just type it into Google, click on the first link. This will bring you to the official landing page from Enthropic where you have multiple different ways to install and use cloud code. But personally, I think it's best to use it in the terminal. So to do that, just copy this command, open the terminal on your computer, doesn't matter if you're using Windows or Mac, and just paste it in and hit enter.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Once you install clot code, you should be able to open any terminal and type in clot. And this will start clot code inside of that project. So, as you can see, this project has no files, no folders, which means we have to work with cloud code to design it from scratch. So, I'm going to do shift tab, which is one of the main keyboard shortcuts you need to know to use cloth code. And I'm going to switch into auto accept mode, which means I don't have to click accept after every single change.

### 📝 詳細説明

Now, when it comes to the model, you can type in /model, and make sure to select opus 4.5. This is currently the most powerful model from Entropic, and hit enter. Now, if you don't want to use cloud code, another great option is Gemini 3 Pro from Google. You can use it inside of cursor. You can use it inside of Droid or inside of the Gemini CLI.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And by the way, I've partnered with Gemini to do an in-person hackathon in Warso, Poland. The hackathon will take place in January of 2026, and there's going to be limited slots. So, if you want to participate, make sure to follow me on Instagram and DM me the word hackathon. So, what I'm going to do first is I'm going to create a folder named prompts. And in here, I'm going to create a new file named prompt_01.md.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, this is the first prompt. So, I'm going to do is go back into cloud code and say read prompt01. And don't worry, I'm going to break it down for you in a second. I'm say and execute what's inside. Nothing more, nothing less.

### 🎯 応用例

The fewer lines of code, the better. If you're wondering how I'm doing this enter to the new line, because if you do shift enter, it will just send the message, right? You need to do control J, not command J, control J on my quest. So, boom. So, as Cloud is building this, let me break down the strategy behind this prompt.

### 💭 考察

So, the first part, as you can see, is a broad overview of what we're trying to do. This tells clot code the what before the how, which prevents the AI agent from wandering and getting distracted. Then we scope out the boundaries, aka the features, what should be part of it, right? Yes or no questions, buying shares of outcomes, and seeing live odds. This explicitly states which features we want.

### 📌 まとめ

That way, we prevent feature bloat. The coding agents are so powerful that the issue isn't that they add too little features, but that they add too many and they get overly excited and they keep bloating your codebase with unnecessary stuff. The third part of this prompt is the text stack. This is an important constraint for the AI agent. And this is actually one of the few decisions that you yourself as the human should do, right?

### ✅ 結論

And if you're new to coding or software architecture, just do a few, you know, researches with perplexity with JBT with CLA to learn about okay, what is the best framework for front end? What are the different databases, right? These things you can learn in a matter of a few prompts. But the text stack is essential because changing the text stack later on is a very very painful thing. So what you should do instead is do a deep research such as with perplexity what tech stack is best and then you describe your app idea in here and boom just a single deep research like this will give you so much things and will prevent you from making a horrible mistake that will be very hard and painful to correct later on.

### 📚 追加情報

So that's the third part of this original prompt. The fourth part is this one telling about the deployment right and a lot of people don't think about this and this video is not just about building. There is countless videos about how to use cloud code and how to build with AI. The second half of this video is all about how to deploy, right? Because what use is building an MVP if you don't know where to host it, if you don't know how to deploy it.

### 🔖 補足

So that's going to be later in the video. But it's important to stay that in the original prompt so that as you're building, you're not shooting yourself in the foot by installing dependencies that are not supported by doing things in a way that will make it very difficult to deploy on certain platforms. That's why I specified in the first prompt. This will be deployed on a VPS using Docky. So ensure the project works with Nixpacks.

### 🎨 セクション 13

The fifth part of the original prompt is this start by creating the project structure and detailed read me. So this is uh what it should do in the first prompt right very clearly we tell what we want what we want to start with and nothing else actually this is the fifth part the sixth part is this last sentence which says don't implement yet right so we tell it not to code yet just to create the architecture the documentation and to prepare it which the code that is going to come in the next prompt which is prompt number two so let's see what cloud code did you can see that used many different tools and it ran for like a minute and it's it's finished right so coding agents are more powerful than ever before building your own software is easier than ever before. So even if you're not a programmer, you can absolutely do this. As you can see, this prompt is written in plain English. And all I did is a bit of research ahead of time again using AI tools, typing in them in plain English.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Okay, so let's see. First, it created these folders with the make directory command. Then it created a package JSON file, created the readme file. So a readme file for those who are new to software development, it's the main documentation file. It describes the project.

### ⚡ セクション 15

It describes the text stack, what the database schema is, and basically it's the fastest ways for anybody to get up to speed. So, if somebody from outside who didn't watch this video and who didn't build a project came in, what they should start with is the readme file. They should look at this and it should be clearly structured to describe what we're building, what the dependencies are, and how to actually start using it. So, that is the purpose of the readme file. Luckily, Cloud Code created that for us.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, we don't have to spend time on that. So, here's the summary of what it did, these files, and the schema. Okay. So, I think we're ready to move to the second prompt. So, new file prompt_2.

### 🎬 セクション 17

The reason I use underscore not space is because that is a very bad practice. The reason for that is a lot of different compilers or terminal commands stuff like that don't like it when there's a space, right? They think it's two separate things. So, just use a dash, use underscore. Do not use spaces in file and folder names.

### 📋 セクション 18

Okay, so here's the second prompt. Set up Nex.js with app router. Tailwind and create the basic pages. Home list markets market detail page create market page. Just UI shell with the mock data.

### ⭐ セクション 19

No API yet. So what I'm trying to do by splitting this into multiple problems is nail each part at a time. Right? So this is the Nex.js front end. We're not doing the API just yet.

### 📝 セクション 20

We're trying to make sure that the front end is good and then we will add the API rather than trying to oneshot everything which a lot of the times the models can do. So we're trying to be more strategic and this allows us to check at every point that things are going well because again making these large refactors is more difficult later on. All right. So again, let's switch to cloth code and I'm going to rem rename this terminal to cloth code just for clarity. Boom.

### 💡 セクション 21

Let me zoom out a bit. Say good work. Now execute prompt number two. Enter. Enter.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And we might need to hit a few approvals here. And if it gets stuck any commands, we can always run them ourselves. And we can ask it what to do. All right. So here's the layout tsx file.

### 🎯 セクション 23

16 editions, one removal, simple layout. And I think at the end us will tell us how to start the front end and how we can check it. All right. So now it's asking for approval to create a new directory. So we're going to approve that and we can see this is a safe command.

### 💭 セクション 24

If you're not sure just ask perplexity is this a safe command should be allow listed. And by the way I'm going to show you a pro tip. If you do like let's do normal search. How can I whitelist certain cloth code commands so that I don't have to manually approve them every time? You can actually create a cloth folder with settings JSON to do this.

### 📌 セクション 25

But if you don't do this again, just ask any AI with web searching capabilities, which all of them have, and it will tell you, right? So now I'm using Gemini 3 inside of perplexity to research this. In the meantime, let's switch back. You can see, okay, the UI has been created, and I will ask a simple and dumb question. Can I test this yet?

### ✅ セクション 26

If so, tell me how. Okay, in the meantime, let's switch back to perplexity. And here's the answer. So we can create a configuration file inside of the doc clo settings folder and we're going to tell it to do that. So boom, let's do that.

### 📚 セクション 27

I'm going to say create this. I will say and include an allow list of safe terminal commands like mkater. And actually we can probably delegate this to perplexity. Give me a list of safe terminal commands that coding AI agents like cloth code should be allowed to run autonomously without human supervision. Answer in short.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Boom. A deep research because we want a comprehensive list so that we don't have to, you know, approve this every time. And actually there's even simpler way. If you look at the types of responses here, if you select number two, it should create the cloth folder itself, right? Yes.

### 🎨 セクション 29

and always allow access to doc for this project. So I'm going to enter. So I'm going to say create a cloud folder settings JSON with an allow list of safe terminal commands in the root of this project. Boom. Then our deep research should give us a list of safe commands for autonomous agents.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So I'm going to copy this. I'm going to go back. So we're going to allow this. Yes. Boom.

### ⚡ セクション 31

We see the cloth folder. Now it should create a new file settings JSON in this file. And I'm doing this to speed up our workflow, right? We don't have to approve these commands every time if we have this settings JSON. And I'm going to say now add these commands into the JSON.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Boom. I'm going to do save. Paste in the proxy research and do save. This is basic context engineering using XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt. And I'm going to say show me what a cloud/ settings.json should be structured like answer in short.

### 🎬 セクション 33

and make sure that it follows the recommended schema. I don't know why it's asking for these edits even though I'm auto accept mode. This is a bug from cloud code. It shouldn't be asking when I'm in auto accept. There we go.

### 📋 セクション 34

It extended our list. Removed some and added a bunch of other safe commands. And you know, rem rseudo move. These are very risky. So, it's in the deny list as well.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Okay, that's good. Let's get back on track here. So, if I scroll back up, we can see that we can run the project. So, let's just do npm install and npm rundeaf. We open a terminal again.

### 📝 セクション 36

Boom. With command J and make sure we are in this project. We are. Okay. And then I'm going to npm install.

### 💡 セクション 37

This will install all the dependencies necessary for our front end to run. Also create the node modules folder with all of the things we need. All right. And then we do npm rundef. This will start the development server on local 3000.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Let's open that in cursor browser. This is a new feature of cursor 2.0. And there it is. We have a simple front end. Nothing crazy, but it works.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And since we're running this inside of the cursor browser, we can debug it more easily. And we can even select like specific UI components, right? Specific divs and fine-tune them, describe how we want them to change. This is a nice feature inside of cursor. All right, so we have the MVP of the front end.

### 💭 セクション 40

Obviously, nothing crazy. We're going to improve this a lot, but let's switch back to cloud code. Let me do command I to close the sidebar. And then we're going to do the first prompt. So let me go boom new file prompt03 paste it in start code execute prompt three boom while it's running let me explain it so add postgress connection using Prisma posgress is what we're going to use for our database and I would highly encourage you to stick with popular text stack right do not go into nosql databases unless you're an expert do not use programming languages that are trending or like frameworks that were just released.

### 📌 セクション 41

And the reason is very simple. They're not in the training data. If you use SQL, if you use Python, if you use JavaScript, there is so many tens of millions, hundreds of millions of lines of code of these languages, frameworks on the internet, which means when a new model such as Opus 4.5 is being trained, it masters those languages. It masters those frameworks, which means it can help you a lot using the mainstream text stack. But if you choose a esoteric text tag that nobody really uses, yeah, good luck.

### ✅ セクション 42

Good luck because the AI models will not be able to help you nearly as much. All right. So then uh create the schema from the readme, generate migrations, ensure database URL is read from the environment variable for do deployment, which means we need to create a env file. So I'm going to right click in the root level of our folder and create an env. This needs to be on the same level as actually I could have just copied this.

### 📚 セクション 43

So we have a env.ample. example. Uh, what do you want to do? I'm going to show you the proper way. What you want to do is simply copy this and then rename and you just remove everything and only leave it.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Environment file where you put your API keys, your secrets and you should never ever share this to anybody and you should never ever commit this to GitHub. Okay, so let me see what close code did. Prisma schema is already created for prompt one. Okay, that's good. Everything's already set up.

### 🎨 セクション 45

All right, so I guess uh this is what I mean when the AI models can get overly excited and they can do stuff ahead of time even though prompt one very clearly said just architecture docs. But okay, let's move on to prompt number four. Boom, there's prompt number four. So again, execute prompt number four. Enter.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Enter. And you can easily tag files by doing the add symbol inside of cloud code inside of most coding agents. So here's the prompt four. Build the API routes. So that's going to be our back end.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Create market, get markets, place bets, market odds, wire up Prisma to each endpoint, test with curl examples. To be honest, I don't even know what Prisma is. And the way to do proper AI development is using the AI tools to upscale yourself, right? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say read prompt04 and read all the files in our project and explain to me what Prisma is in this context and why we need it. Think harder answer in short.

### 🌟 セクション 48

This is the biggest difference between people who are just vibe coders and they don't really get anywhere. You know they might be able to build an MVP. Anybody can build an MVP, right? Anybody can build a V1. But the real difference is are you able to deploy it?

### 🎬 セクション 49

Are you able to host it somewhere? Are you able to maintain the code? Are you able to get your first paying customer? Are you able to add authentication payments? Are you able to scale your software?

### 📋 セクション 50

These are the real questions. And the difference is people who get stuck, they don't use AI to upskill themselves. I don't care if you're a professional developer. I don't care if you've never coded before. I don't care if you're 70 years old.

### ⭐ セクション 51

You can learn. Brain has neuroplasticity until you die. You can absolutely learn. And that's how you should be using AI to upskill yourself. First and foremost, I'm going to stop because uh it should not do any changes.

### 📝 セクション 52

Do not do any changes. Just explain what I asked you to explain. Make your answer simpler and shorter. This is a particular issue with Gemini 3. It is very overeager and it doesn't follow instructions, right?

### 💡 セクション 53

Um yeah, even when you tell it just to answer your question, you just start making code changes which is very annoying. But hey, Prisma is a bridge between your code and the database. Why we need a translation? Automatically turns your TypeScript code into database commands. Oh, okay.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So, it's similar to SQL Alchemy. So, I'm going to say, oh, is it similar to SQL Alchemy? So, now I'm actually learning, you know, I realized that it's uh like a Oh, yeah. OM. Let's see.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Yes, exactly. Prisma to TypeScript is what SQL Alchemy is to Python. Both are OMS that lets you define your database structure in code models. So this kind of simplifies you know you don't have to master SQL if you use something like Prisma or SQL alchemy you can define your database in your code which is good because again your you can get even more help from the AI models. All right so let's see we need approval.

### 💭 セクション 56

Okay we need to give cloud code approval. Okay it's a safe command. I don't know why it's this is annoying that it's asking for approval even though we created this uh settings JSON which clearly gives it approval. Maybe we just need to restart cloud code. It's very possible.

### 📌 セクション 57

All right, done. API routes created. And since we asked for curl commands, it gave me all the curl commands to do. So I'm going to ask u did you also wire it up in our app? So I can skip the curl command testing.

### ✅ セクション 58

By the way, I do recommend you learning curl at least, you know, two, three hours put into it, understand what it is, how to use it, you know, the different headers and stuff like that. Oh, that's that's prompt five. I'm going to stop it right there. So, you can interrupt cloth code anytime by pressing escape. Right?

### 📚 セクション 59

So, it was rushing ahead of time, but this is prompt five. So, I'm just going to create it. And this will connect the front end to the API. Right? So say now execute prompt five like a 10x engineer would.

### 🔖 セクション 60

The fewer lines of code the better. This is another one of my favorite prompts. The fewer lines of code the better. And again it's to keep the codebase simple keep it clean to prevent the AI models for going too crazy adding too many lines of code and then nobody can orientate themselves in the codebase. So yeah, this problem basically tells you to make it functional end to end so that the user can use all these API routes and basic styling polish.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Actually, we could probably use Gemini 3 for that because uh I think Gemini 3 Pro is right now the best at front end. So I'm going to say your task is to read every single front end file in our project and greatly improve the design and UI of our front end. Do not change any logic or functionality of our app. Just make it look better. Get to work.

### 🚀 セクション 62

All right. So, Cloore is finished and we're going to launch Gemini 3 to revamp our front end. We still have it launched here. Uh, let me refresh this. Are we getting an error?

### ⚡ セクション 63

Okay. Boom. Screenshot. We could debug this inside of cursor, but we're using cloud code, so it's going to be um screenshot. Uh, fix this.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Oh, actually we didn't we didn't run this. Oops. You probably need to kill the terminal. I'm going to kill it. npm install again.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Should probably follow what Cl is telling us, right? Boom. And then we need to run npm rundef again. We need postgress running quickest fix docker run postgress npx prisma db push. We need to also change this in our env.

### 📋 セクション 66

Okay. So gemini has revamped our front end. That's good to know. I'm going to say I have Docker Desktop. Can I use that?

### ⭐ セクション 67

For simplicity, I want to show you Docker Desktop because it's you can just go to Google and type in Docker Desktop and install this in like 2 minutes. So, let me see if it works with that. Yes. Run this in your terminal. Boom.

### 📝 セクション 68

Okay. So, let's run it. We need to copy this. Open our env. Close this prompt file.

### 💡 セクション 69

Open our env. Change this like so. none of these uh new line gaps. Okay. And then uh this is the issue with that command.

### 🔧 セクション 70

It's it's getting split into two lines. Okay. Now it should be good. Need to make sure there is the no new line character. Okay.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Wait, let me make sure my docker is running. It wasn't running. Okay. That's a beginner mistake. So let's try that again.

### 💭 セクション 72

Clear. Boom. All right. Uh let me see. I'm going to paste this in.

### 📌 セクション 73

Is this good? And then in the meantime, we can clear this and do npm rundef. Let's see if this works. Open it cursor browser again. We're getting a different error.

### ✅ セクション 74

Oh, we didn't run the Prisma command. Okay, I'm going to do control C to kill it. So when you're in uh terminal, control C again, not command C. I'm on Mac OS. So when I say command on Windows, that's control, butt control C on Mac OS kills the processes, right?

### 📚 セクション 75

So that's what I did. And then let's see, we need to run this npx prisma db push. All right, that's good. And then we I'm going do app arrow. So when you're in terminal, you can do up arrow to cycle through commands you recently run.

### 🔖 セクション 76

And I'm going npm rundev again. And we're going to go browser reload this. And there we go. Our app is loading. No markets are created.

### 🎨 セクション 77

So let's create one. Uh will Bitcoin hit 100K in 2024? That's boring. Will BTC hit 200K in 2026? That's a better question.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Okay, we created the market but it's not here. Okay, we also need to change the name of this from poly market to David market. Change all naming from poly market to David market, you know, just so we don't get sued. And uh I'm going to again screenshot is underrated. I think this is actually recording.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Yeah, I mean look this is um this is definitely not optimal because we're using Gemini 3 for front end design and we're using cloth code for the logic but u hey sometimes you got to do unscalable things and what you need to do is describe the error right when I create a market it does not appear anywhere and then I'm going to do here are the terminal logs boom logs again XML tags open the terminal with command J copy the whole thing boom paste it into clo And I'm going to close the XML tags locks. Investigate what is wrong. Ultraink and answer in short. So ultra thinking is a keyword that will use the maximum reasoning effort for cloth code and that's why it was this rainbow color. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 80

So that was fast. Anyways, next auto cache just cache page quick fix get refresh. So it caused a refresh after we created market. That's good. And uh Gemini renamed everything to David market.

### 🎬 セクション 81

That's also good. Let's uh go back here and reload. And we have our market here. Okay, let's open it up. Will Bitcoin hit 200k 26.

### 📋 セクション 82

50% chance. I'm going to trade $5 on buying. Yes. And it's change the odds, right? So, it's a automated market maker.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Let me do $17 on no. Boom. Now, it's more of a chance. Now, I'm going to $99 on the yes. And we're skewing the odds.

### 📝 セクション 84

Now, if I drop $217 on no, you can see that the math is working. Homepage is kind of So, I'm going to say the main landing page is kind of weak. We need to see the markets, the odds, and some visual graphs. Get to work and make this happen. Also, avoid these cringe vibe coding gradients.

### 💡 セクション 85

Instead, use a clean white, gray, black, metallic color palette. Again, do not change any logic or functionality of our app. And even though I'm typing with several typos, it doesn't matter. These are language models. They can easily understand that.

### 🔧 セクション 86

And what I'm trying to stress is I'm using the best model for the work. I'm using Gemini 3 for the front end design, which right now it's best at front end design. And I'm using cloud code with Opus 4.5 for their core logic which again it's best at that. Okay. So the MVP of our app works.

### 🎯 セクション 87

So while Gemini upgrade their front end we're going to do what most content creators don't show you. How to actually deploy it how to actually host it. Because look it's almost 2026 like anybody can build an app in a matter of a few prompts. Right here we did it in five prompts, but if you have a simple idea, maybe it's a one prompt thing, a two prompt things. That is not an impressive thing anymore.

### 💭 セクション 88

It was a year ago. It certainly was two years ago. It's not anymore. So, I'm going to show you what all the other YouTubers don't show you. And I'm going to take it a step further and do the deployment.

### 📌 セクション 89

But first we need to set up a GitHub for this because in order to deploy a project anywhere you almost always need to have it on GitHub or you know alternatives to GitHub but GitHub is the most popular way to store code and um again you don't have to master it in the new society. I have a few modules on the essentials of GitHub for coding with AI but basically you just need a GitHub account. It takes a few minutes to create one. And then go to top right, click on repositories, click on new. I'm going to name it David market because that's what we're building here.

### ✅ セクション 90

I'm going to make it public so all of you can use it. And actually before we do that, we need to change we need to tell cloud one more important thing. create a comprehensive git ignore file in the root of our project to properly exclude all sensitive files because right now we don't have it. So right now if we initialize the git repository everything would be tracked by git. We don't want that.

### 📚 セクション 91

We want a git ignore so that node modules which is useless just a folder with a very large f folder with lots of megabytes. We don't want to upload that to GitHub or ENV files. Basically, whatever cloud code put into git ignore, right? Again, the models have gotten so good, you don't have to specify what should be in the git ignore. They have tens of millions of different git ignores in their training data.

### 🔖 セクション 92

So, they know what should be in there. Now, obviously, if your project is very esoteric, you probably should extend it yourself. Okay. Read me, we don't need it. Get ignore, we don't need it.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Also, GitHub offers it, right? So like if you can do like Python or Nex.js or whatever, if you don't trust CL code, just use one of the GitHub presets. They're really solid. Anyways, I'm going to create this repo. I'm going to uh switch back.

### 🚀 セクション 94

And actually, we can look at our new front end. I forgot that Gemini 3 improved our front end. Boom. Much better. Look at this.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Clean black and white. We have a We have a what's it called? A slider. Will Bitcoin hit? Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 96

And yeah, we have the landing page. Let's create a new market. Will agent zero go public before 2030? Create market. Okay, so it's 50/50 as any new market should be.

### 🎬 セクション 97

I'm going to do uh 1337 for yes. That should skew the odds massively. Okay, it didn't. 20 for no, right? 1337 for yes.

### 📋 セクション 98

Okay, why is this not working? Okay, maybe four digits too much. Oh, it was more than the volume. Okay, so we're not handling that properly. That's a edge case.

### ⭐ セクション 99

We're going to look into that in a bit. But now let's lock in on the GitHub setup, right? So I'm going to say tell me how step by step how I can connect our project to GitHub. Think harder answer in short. So think harder is not as powerful as ultra think, but it's one level one level lower.

### 📝 セクション 100

What we need to do is we need to in initialize a new git repository. So I'm going to open a terminal. I'm going to do get in it. Boom. This will initialize an empty G repository.

### 💡 セクション 101

You can see if you're using an ID and this is why you should be using cursor or VS code is if you go into the top right you have the source control and you can see which files are about to be staged and which files are not. And you can see that um all of this is ready to be committed ready to be staged. So again, I already ran the first, but if you don't know what you're doing, just ask AI, right? Don't get stuck. Don't run into this uh like don't take errors personally.

### 🔧 セクション 102

That's the main thing. You have to be willing to solve problems. You need to become you need to think like an entrepreneur. Even if you're not an entrepreneur, you need to think like an entrepreneur and develop your problem solving skills. Any problem can be solved.

### 🎯 セクション 103

And if you run into an error, don't take it personally. just describe how the error happened and use the cutting edge AI models like Opus 4.5, like Gemini 3 Pro to help you out. So even though I've set up many G repositories in the past and I'm familiar with GitHub, if I'm going fast, too fast through any of this, just pause, take a screenshot, put it into CL, put it into ChatGpt, Perplexity, Gemini, doesn't matter. And just ask them to explain it. Right?

### 💭 セクション 104

So here I asked Claude just as I was complete beginner to list out the commands and it's telling me what to do. So first we need to stage all files. Get add dot that stages everything. You can also do git add/ a by the way that's a pro tip. Then we need to do the initial commit.

### 📌 セクション 105

So get commit-m and this and then the commit message. I would highly recommend you actually learn the main five git commands, right? Git add, git commit, git push, maybe git log, git reflog. I mean there's a bunch, but yeah, if you learn the main five, seven, 10 g commands, I mean git, there's hundreds of commands in git, but like again, learn the main seven, eight commands. It's very good to know how to type them yourself without AI.

### ✅ セクション 106

But again, feel free to start with AI. All of us did. So I'm going to first commit. Boom. That's a commit message.

### 📚 セクション 107

Close the quotation mark. I'm going to do clear to make the terminal clear. Then we need to set what is the main branch also known as m master branch doesn't matter you can name this main you can name this master those are the two most popular names g branch but you only do this at at the start right once when you're setting up your project so get branch- m capital m main vag set now we need to connect the remote git repository luckily github makes this super simple they literally give you the URL so let's copy that then we do get remote at origin and we just paste it Hit enter. Super simple. Clear again.

### 🔖 セクション 108

And then this is the main part. We push everything, right? So when you initialize git, it is local on your machine. But we need to push it to GitHub. That's how you get it stored.

### 🎨 セクション 109

That's how you can uh deploy it on apps and stuff like that. So I'm going to do get push and again the you need to do this only once. The dash u this this is a you set upstream tracking. Don't worry, you don't have to understand all the technical details. in origin main and it is will push it to GitHub.

### 🚀 セクション 110

If we refresh here, we should see our folders, our files have been successfully pushed to GitHub. Here is our readme file explaining everything. And yeah, we have successfully moved everything to GitHub. So now it's not just on my machine, it's uh stored here, which means if we connect GitHub anywhere, we can easily deploy it, which is exactly what we're going to do right now. We're going to take what we built and I'm going to show you the most affordable way to deploy this and to self-host it.

### ⚡ セクション 111

So, you're not relying on Versell. You're not going to get a surprise $300,000 Versel bill. And trust me, there's plenty of examples where people got charged like $60,000 overnight because uh Versell is serverless. Uh you're you don't have to rely on Superbase, on Netlifi, on Render, Railway, none of that. I'm going to show you how to self-host it, which is by the way the most affordable way.

### 🌟 セクション 112

But most people are scared of it, which is why they don't do it. And they become overly reliant on, you know, cloud hosted solutions such as Versell. But hey, since you're watching this video, you have nothing to worry about. I'm going to show you everything step by step. And I'm going to show you how to use AI to help you out with the parts that might seem difficult.

### 🎬 セクション 113

So, if you watch until the end, you will know how to take any app you build and how to actually deploy it to the internet. So, you can get paying customers, you can share with your friends, and that alone will put you in the top 1% of AI coders. Most people can build an MVP, but they don't know how to deploy it or how to host it. So, we're going to do that right now. Now, before I show you how to actually self-host your app, let me explain the benefits of self-hosting because not many people understand this.

### 📋 セクション 114

First off, you have cheap, predictable costs versus any surprise versus cell bills. you know, nobody wants to be charged 700k or whatever, even if it's like $3,000. I mean, this happened to one people on my team literally. He he was like surprised charged a couple hundred for a simple MVP side project through Versel, right? So, if you have your own self-hosted server, you're probably paying like couple bucks a month and that's a constant predictable cost that is much more affordable than using all these cloud hosted solutions.

### ⭐ セクション 115

Also, with your own VPS, you can have functions running 24/7. Whereas, if you use built-in versile functions, there's only 60-cond limit on those. Another benefit is that you can have a direct database connection from your front end or from your back end, you don't have to worry about RL RLS policies, setting that up on superbase, stuff like that. You can install the database directly on your VPS and you can use only open-source frameworks, solutions, front ends, backends, databases, whatever. Everything you use can be open source if you have your own VPS.

### 📝 セクション 116

You can choose where all of the code comes comes from. That's not the case if you're using a third party hosting solutions, right? Often times they don't have most of their code open source. So you don't see any vulnerabilities or you just don't own everything, right? So there are several benefits, several more benefits of self-hosting.

### 💡 セクション 117

These are the main ones. Now let me show you how to actually self-host any app that you build through using Dock Play. So as I hinted earlier for the self-hosting part we're going to use dog play and it is by the way open source you can go to their GitHub and check it out. Um as they say it's a open source alternative to the cell netify and Heroku right so this allows you to selfhost end to end full stack your whole application and uh you feel free to read through it I'm going to link it below the video but also what it does is it give you a simple clear UI to manage your VPS. So without doc ploy we would have to be a little bit of devops expert right we would have to master Linux we would have to know the basic terminal commands to run and stuff like that but with dock ploy we get this nice UI to manage our services front end backend database whatever we need we get the logs I'll show you all of that but what do ploy does it it makes self-hosting much much more approachable and much easier than otherwise and that's why we're going to use dock ploy to host this app but first we need somewhere where to host it, right?

### 🔧 セクション 118

We need our own server. We need a VPS, a virtual private server. And for that, we're going to use Hostinger. So, if you go to Hostinger, they offer many different VPS servers. Personally, I use the KVN2 one for everything I need.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Uh I have actually multiple of these VPS. One for my AI agents. So, I you can use Hostinger with NAN as well, by the way, to host every NA10 automation that you build, which otherwise you would have to use NA10 cloud for that, which is a lot more expensive than Hostinger. But I also have a hostinger VPS for experimenting with deployments, right? Deploying apps to my own server and I have full root access to that server.

### 💭 セクション 120

So I can do anything I want with it. Plus it's a lot more affordable than alternatives like Versell, Netify, Heroku, Superbase, stuff like that. Trust me, I know that because for my startup, I'm paying hundreds of dollars per month for these third-party hosted solutions because when I started, I wasn't familiar with VPS and I certainly wasn't familiar with tools like Docky or Hostinger, which make managing your own VPS so much easier. So, let me show you how to set up the KVM2 plan. So, click on choose plan, and this will redirect you to the checkout here.

### 📌 セクション 121

Select the period. I recommend going 24 months because when you build your agents, you want them to be running forever. Plus, you get a really, really solid deal when you go with the 24-month plan. You even get a free domain for a year as a bonus. And since Hostinger was kind enough to sponsor this video, if you click on have coupon code and type in David, you will get another 10% off of your plan.

### ✅ セクション 122

Next, we need to select the location of our server. So, just select whatever is the closest to you. And then what remains is finishing the checkout. So, click on continue. Next, we need to create an account.

### 📚 セクション 123

And this takes 20 seconds. Super simple. Now, after you sign up, you get redirected to the billing page where you fill out your name and your billing details. And complete the purchase of your VPS. Make sure to check out Hostinger.

### 🔖 セクション 124

Use the link below the video. Now, once you complete the checkout, go to the Hostinger panel on the left, click on VPS, and here you'll see your VPS servers. So, here's the new fresh VPS that requires setup. And I'm going to walk you through that right now. And you can see this is my other one, which is hosting all my NA10 agents and automations.

### 🎨 セクション 125

So, I'm going to click on setup. Next, we need to select the server location. So, obviously, choose something that's close to you or close to your customers. So, if you're selling to the USA, choose Boston or Phoenix. Pretty self-explanatory.

### 🚀 セクション 126

This is important though. We need to choose the operating system. So, we're going to do OS with panel and we're going to use dock ploy. There it is. Boom.

### ⚡ セクション 127

Select. Next up, we need to set the root password for our VPS. And this is to login and access the VPS. So, just make sure to generate a secure one. And actually, there's only certain symbols allowed.

### 🌟 セクション 128

I'm going to generate a few with my password manager to see. Okay, there it is. Something like this where it's a secure string of random characters and it matches these conditions because we're going to be using that to deploy stuff to our VPS. So, just do not share this with anybody. I'm going to change this password before uploading this video, obviously.

### 🎬 セクション 129

Okay, click on next. All right, we can keep the malware scan enabled if you want. Again, can change that later on. And now it's setting up the VPS. And as it says, this process usually takes a few minutes because it's installing Abuntu, which is a Linux distro.

### 📋 セクション 130

And it again, hosting is making the VPS setup a lot simpler, right? If you had to take a server from scratch and install Linux, set up everything, then you're basically a DevOps expert, right? And that's a whole job. That's a whole profession. But since most of us are not DevOps professionals, we want to make it as simple as possible.

### ⭐ セクション 131

That's why using things like Hostinger, like do ploy and by using AI agents like cloth code, we can remove a lot of that complexity while still maintaining full control over the VPS, right? We will still have root access. We can still do whatever we want with it. Install any type of text stack, use it in any way we want, but we just simplify it for ourselves, which that's the definition of high leverage. All right.

### 📝 セクション 132

So, it took less than six minutes. Was like two or three. But now the VPS is ready. So, let's click on manage VPS. This will get us to the dashboard for the server.

### 💡 セクション 133

We already have dog play right here. Nice. So, let's click on manage panel and this will open up docloy. As you can see, we have the UI. So, we don't have to mess with the shell directly.

### 🔧 セクション 134

We don't have to, you know, open the raw terminal and know all the Linux commands. This is what dock ploy makes a lot lot easier. All right. Here. So, we need to set up the server.

### 🎯 セクション 135

So these are credentials that will let us access the server. So I'm going to do David Andre David David Andre. You know my email. Then here you should probably do a different password than on the root server, right? So here we set a root password to our VPS, but this is to the docy login.

### 💭 セクション 136

So choose a different password. Boom. Just paste that in. Register. User registered successfully.

### 📌 セクション 137

And there we go. We're inside of docloy. Now again we can leverage the UI to deploy anything any service any you know front end any back end any database. Uh do has a lot and we're not going to go through everything in this video. I'm just going to show you the simplest way to deploy a Nex.js project which by the way that's what we built.

### ✅ セクション 138

We use Nex.js which is one of the most popular front ends uh frameworks for front end. And we're I'm going to show you how to deploy this on your VPS so it can be publicly accessible and you can build it into actual AI SAS and start getting customers. So let's go back into the deploy and we're going to click on create project. We're going to name it David market create. This creates a new project with that name.

### 📚 セクション 139

Next we're going to go to top right again and click on create service and application. So this is going to be the service for the whole app because remember we deployed everything. Oh, that's not our GitHub. This is our GitHub. We deployed everything um including the back end API routes.

### 🔖 セクション 140

So just naming that front end would not be the best. I'm going to name it just app and create. Then I'm going to click on that. And here we have the provider aka the source of the code. And obviously we selected GitHub.

### 🎨 セクション 141

And again feel free to use GitLab, Bitbucket or any other alternative to deploy your code but we're going to use GitHub. And as it says here to deploy using GitHub you need to configure your account first. Please go to settings to do so. Let's click on settings. Let's click on GitHub.

### 🚀 セクション 142

This is not an organization GitHub. This is simply my own. So, click on create GitHub app. We need to authenticate with GitHub mobile. It's asking to create a GitHub app.

### ⚡ セクション 143

So, here's the generated name. And we can change this later. So, let's just create. And there we go. We need an action required.

### 🌟 セクション 144

Okay. So, what's the required action? Probably some approval. Okay. So, this is very confusing.

### 🎬 セクション 145

This button is not clickable. You have to click on this button which uh will give permission to certain repositories. Right? So I'm going to do only select repositories and we're going to do the David market. There we go.

### 📋 セクション 146

Install and authorize. And now we can go back to our projects to David market to the app itself. And there we go. We can select the GitHub account. There's the app.

### ⭐ セクション 147

Select the repository. David Market branch. So remember we have the main branch. That's actually the only branch we have. So that's simple.

### 📝 セクション 148

But you know, if you had a development branch, you would select that or staging branch, whatever you want, right? You can have a separate deployment for a staging environment, separate deployment for production. It's up to you. As the project grows, you're going to have more deployments. Then build path, we leave it as is.

### 💡 セクション 149

Trigger type, we can leave it on push. That's good. We can skip these and we can click save. Now, if you scroll down, you'll see the build type. Next packs, that's good.

### 🔧 セクション 150

So that's what we want uh for next.js that's optimal. And then scroll back up and click on deploy. Confirm. Application deployed successfully. So what basically what's happening is that docloy is connecting to GitHub.

### 🎯 セクション 151

It's going to take our GitHub repo. It's going to deploy it on the VPS that we're hosting on Hostinger and we should be able to access our app in less than a minute. We can actually click on view to see the logs in real time. and to see how our app is being built and deployed. So from the very beginning initializing deployment, it clones the repo from our GitHub into our VPS installing all the dependencies and we should be able to see this go green any moment now.

### 💭 セクション 152

All right, so no build errors for Nex.js. That's good. Let's reload this. Okay, it's still yellow. We need to wait until it's green.

### 📌 セクション 153

And there it is. So it has been deployed. Done. Next, we go to domains. And we can use a free domain from Docloy.

### ✅ セクション 154

So, domains, add domain, and then if you don't have your own custom domain, just click on this. We'll get a free one. And the rest, you can just leave it as is. Just click on create. And now we have our own domain.

### 📚 セクション 155

So, if you click that, we should see our app. And of course, we have an error. That's funny. So, I'm going to screenshot. Uh, boom.

### 🔖 セクション 156

We're going to debug this with cloud code and paste this in. I just deployed my app on dock ploy. However, when I visit the URL, the app is crashing. See image. And also, we need to give it the logs.

### 🎨 セクション 157

This is very important. Oh, maybe we haven't validated DNS. So, let's click on validate DNS. Checking DNS. DNS valid.

### 🚀 セクション 158

Okay. So, let's reload our app. Reload this. Boom. Click on the URL again.

### ⚡ セクション 159

And actually, that's my bad. This is not a random error. This is because our app is trying to connect to the database. Remember locally we ran docker we run postgress through docker but here we haven't set it up yet because our app is only the app itself right which is only the front and the back end we haven't created the service for the database yet which is what we're going to do right now so create service database we're going to use progress we're just going to name it DB which is a shortcut for database the rest we can leave as defaults click on create click on the database we need to copy the internal connection URL there it is copy Boom. Then we need to go back to the projects into our app into environment and we need to save it in the same format as we have right here.

### 🌟 セクション 160

So actually we can probably use this to set it up. Boom. So database URL equals we're going to do the full thing, right? So copy that. Boom.

### 🎬 セクション 161

Need to paste it in here. So let's go general and let's do deploy again. We need to redeploy because we changed the environment variables. And now our app should successfully connect to our database. And you can see how easy do makes it, right?

### 📋 セクション 162

Like the amount of things that Hostinger and Docky hides away all the abstractions, all the complexity. It's kind of amazing. Um hosting your own managing your own VPS has never been easier. Self-hosting has never been easier. Just like building your own custom software thanks to coding agents like Cloud Code, Cursor, Codex has never been easier.

### ⭐ セクション 163

We literally live in the best time to build software. If you're not building your own software, what are you doing? Like again, you not everybody needs to build a startup. You could just build a script for yourself to save yourself time. Build some internal software, internal tools for your own company, for your team.

### 📝 セクション 164

Up to you. There's so many different things you can do, but it has never been easier. And yeah, there's tools like hostinger, like docloy, like cloud code that really make this easy. Okay, so we have u new deployment. So let's go back validate DNS and let's open our app.

### 💡 セクション 165

We still getting this error. We need to check the logs though. I don't know if it's uh still deployed deployments. Is this is this done? Done.

### 🔧 セクション 166

So let's go back here and let's visit domain again. We're still getting this error. But what we should do is we should scroll to logs and we should see what's happening in the logs. We actually click on copy. So let's jump into plot code and just paste in the logs and let's see what it suggests.

### 🎯 セクション 167

Right? So we need to give it context. We need to give it the screenshot of the white crash screen and then the full logs of our VPS to see what's happening and so that it can help us fix it up. and I told it to do ultra think. All right.

### 💭 セクション 168

So, so it gave us a long answer. I'm going to say make your answer simpler and shorter. It's another one of my all-time favorite prompts when the LLMs uh give you long answer. Start command. Okay.

### 📌 セクション 169

So, we need to change the start command. Database. Make sure the database service is running. It should be in the same project. Let's let's go back.

### ✅ セクション 170

Are they in the same project? Projects. Yes, they are. Start command. Oh, it's not deployed.

### 📚 セクション 171

Oops. That's my bad. Okay. Well, I'm going to deploy it. Yeah, that's that's a bigger mistake, you know, not deploying the database.

### 🔖 セクション 172

Uh, but luckily that's fast. Deployment completed successfully. And close that. Boom. And maybe it works now.

### 🎨 セクション 173

Still not. Let's check the logs for this. I'm going to paste it in. Boom. Logs.

### 🚀 セクション 174

Logs. Above are the logs for the Postgress deployment. Yes, I forgot it. Started, but now it runs. What's the next step?

### ⚡ セクション 175

Ultra thinking and surf in short. Boom. We're going to use cloud code to help us out. There's no shame in that. And actually, maybe it's good that it didn't go well on the first try.

### 🌟 セクション 176

You know, like I could easily cut this out, but I'm going to show you how I use AI to debug this. Oh, we need to run these migrations. Okay, so this should be correct from your local machine. Prisma DB push. Uh, okay.

### 🎬 セクション 177

So, we need to run this in the doc app terminal. So, projects, let's go into our app. We need to Where is the terminal access here? General. Oh, there open terminal.

### 📋 セクション 178

Yeah. So, we need to run this npx prisma db push. Enter. This will use Prisma to create the database tables. Again, Prisma is an RM.

### ⭐ セクション 179

This allows us to work with the database through code. Uh we have an error. So again, screenshot Prisma is not installed. Maybe we need to run npm install first. Again, deploy this on.

### 📝 セクション 180

We might just need to do npm uh install. Stand build doesn't include a Prisma schema. run it from your local machine instead. Okay, so this is a bit confusing, but we deployed everything on GitHub and then cloned that into dock ploy. How come it doesn't have the Prisma?

### 💡 セクション 181

Okay, so this is supposedly the easiest solution. So I'm going to trust cloud code and do that. We need the VPS IP. So we get that here. Uh uh uh.

### 🔧 セクション 182

Is this the IP you need? paste that in. We also need to expose the port 5432 publicly. Make sure port is exposed on docloy database service. So we go dock ploy we go uh yes we need to close the terminal confirm we need to go to again projects and on our database let's see if the port internal port external port external credentials in order to make the database reachable for internet you must set a port being okay external port internet 5432 5432 save okay external port updated that's good so we should run this locally this command.

### 🎯 セクション 183

So let's do that. Enter. Okay, that looks like success. So I'm going to do logs. Paste that in.

### 💭 セクション 184

Logs. Above are the terminal logs from my local terminal. Did it go well? Just a confirmation. Can see if this loads.

### 📌 セクション 185

Oh, it loaded. Yes, table successfully. Your app should work now. And it does work now. And it's deployed on a public URL.

### ✅ セクション 186

All of you can access this. So let's create a new market. Uh uh uh what about will Elon Musk become the first trillionaire? Okay. Create market.

### 📚 セクション 187

And let's start betting on this. Right. So I'm going to do $50. Yes. Chances are shifted.

### 🔖 セクション 188

Somebody does $99. No. Again. Okay. We have error.

### 🎨 セクション 189

So we get some errors. Obviously we can debug this. I'm not going to pretend we build a perfect app right away. But the fact that our app works and we have everything deployed on a VPS, it's pretty pretty insane. And again, I already showed you how to debug.

### 🚀 セクション 190

I showed you the most essential skill. Uh you can paste in the screenshots, paste in the context into cloud code, and it can help solve anything just like we did right now. Now you know how to build and deploy any AI SAS yourself and how to self-host it, which is something that most people never do. It's the most affordable option, but most people are scared of it because they don't know about Docy and they don't know about Hostinger. So again, shout out to Hostinger for sponsoring this video.

### ⚡ セクション 191

Go below. It's going to be the first link below the video. Get your VPM. The KVM2 plan is more than enough. You can deploy any ASAs on this and get it started and get your first few paying customers.

### 🌟 セクション 192

And this is the most affordable way to build your own startup to build your own ASAs and to host it. And you have full access, full root access to RO server. So again, go in the video description, click the first link, and set up your hosting or VPS today. With that being said, thank you guys for watching and have a wonderful rest of the week. See you.
