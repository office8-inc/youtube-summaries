## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, for the longest time, uh, I wanted to kind of recreate kind of when I was like into FPS gaming and stuff, and that was like Modern Warfare 2. And I just love kind of the sniper gameplay, the 360 no scope, the kill cams, and all the banter around that. So, uh, what you see on the screen here is what I wanted to try to do by using the new Claude Opus 4.5 model. So, I just started out this weekend. I wanted to just do a big grind and trying to recreate the game here.

### 📋 背景・概要

So you can see probably the screen I have some kill cam replays. We have some cool sniper action. So today I just want to walk you kind of through what I have done, how I'm using Opus 4.5 to actually do the coding for me and what plans I have for this game. This is going to be more of like a game dev blog. Uh not vlog but log.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So I'm just going to keep updating and my ultimate goal is to do like a multiplayer version of this. I have a plan for this, but now I've been just playing around with the learning how the bot should be optimized to get a cool gameplay. So yeah, today I just want to show you what I've done so far and we're going to implement a feature when you can see how I'm using claw code with Opus 4.5 to implement some features. I thought we're going to do some achievements, maybe some golden knives or something. So yeah, let's just get over there and see what we have so far.

### 📝 詳細説明

Okay, so let me just walk you through the game now. So, I call this like 360 no scope, right? And I created this animated video in the background and yeah, I have an account I can log into now, right? I have my username, my email, so I can log out and I have some stats here. I'm probably going to go into that later.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Uh, we have most sensitivity. We have Yeah, I only have one weapon at the moment, but the game is pretty simple, right? We are playing against AI CPU uh I created. So basically I base this on the counter strike bot system a star I think it's called. So let's if we start the game now you can see I also had some ads here youtube.com/my channel and it's going to be per round and the bot should be yeah it's hiding behind there now.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Okay so it's firing and I have these smoke trails and you can see we can scope. >> You suck. Get better. Okay, so we have this uh now it's one nil to the bot. Let me do some I'm not so good at the Okay, so we got the kill cam there.

### 🎯 応用例

That's pretty cool. So then we get the instant replay as I remember it from Modern Warfare 2 of the game play. It's a bit laggy and stuff. It's not perfect, but it's pretty cool. >> Uh we have the knife, so we can switch to knife gameplay if we run out of bullets because we only have six bullets.

### 💭 考察

So, let's try to attack the bot now and dodge the bullets and then try to kill it with a knife. It also has a knife, so we could also die. >> Just go back to being >> You can see we got stabbed there. Uh, so let's try to get him with a sniper instead. >> Noob learn to play.

### 📌 まとめ

>> Yeah, I got this track there. >> Uh, I have music I created on Suno and everything. So this is basically the game loop. You can play around best of five, right? And you can just start the game wherever you want.

### ✅ 結論

So the idea is kind of to get cool uh kill cams and stuff like that. You can jump and shoot. Uh I'm not the best at it. So you can see there's a small bugs there like that. >> What the [ __ ] Are you drunk?

### 📚 追加情報

>> I was there. Are you drunk? So let's try to get him with the knife again. I think that's fun. So I got to dodge the bullets.

### 🔖 補足

It's not always that easy. >> Learn to play. >> Okay, so let's go back to the sniper again. So, you kind of get the point. This >> your mom is disappointed.

### 🎨 セクション 13

>> Okay, so that is basically the game, right? So, now uh I kind of want to show you how I'm actually adding new features just a workflow uh around using like uh cloud code here and of course cursor for the management of the files. So, yeah. So, what I thought we can do is uh I want to do some features. So, let's say uh maybe we want to add some knife sound, knife kill, gun kill tracking because now we only have kills.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Uh and I want to create an achievements page. Uh when we get 10 knife kills, we unlock a gold knife. So, that is what I'm going to take you through today. How I'm going to do all of these implementations by using Opus 4.5 include code. Uh I will admit, as you probably see here, uh I have I guess you can't see it here.

### ⚡ セクション 15

I guess if you go all the way to the top now, uh I have let's do a compact and I can show you I have updated to the max $200 now dollar version because it's just so good. I just need to use it uh I think over this u period at least for a month. I want to try it out. See how much I can do with this. And yeah, like I said, you can see I am on the max now 200.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So yeah, pretty expensive, but uh so far I just think it's been worth it. Never have I ever run into any like issues and I uh have used opus for point time uh opus for point the whole time. So let let me show you how I'm going to do this now. So let's say we wanted to start with um the knife kill gun kill tracking. So what I do is I'm basically now I have some kind of control over my code here, right?

### 🎬 セクション 17

Uh but uh Opus 4.5 is really good at figuring out what it needs to do. So let's say uh I wanted to do the the knife and kill tracking now. So basically I just do um I just do an instruction here and then I go into plan mode. I'm going to show you. To be honest, I think we can do this as simple as this.

### 📋 セクション 18

This is how strong Opus 4.5 is. So I can do we want to separate kills tracking by knife and gun. Please investigate code and create a plan for this new system. Then I'm just going to switch to plan mode. And that's about it.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So now you can see uh at least in many cases Opus 4.5 will now go into a small exploring agents where it kind of looks at the code. Yeah, you can see it here. It's just going to start up this small agents that kind of yeah looks at all the code and then it's going to come up with a plan how to do this because now we need to update our database and we need to track uh what kind of type of kill um we get when we use the knife or the sniper, right? This is because if we're going to do an achievement on knife kills, uh we need to keep track of uh what kills are done with the knife and what is done with the gun. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 20

So now I'm just going to uh let the cloud code work here with open 4.5 and when we have something I'm going to show you how I kind of do it when we're going to implement the plan. Okay. So you can see now uh kind of the exploring agent is done. So now uh kind of cloud code has an um comprehensive understanding of the code. So now we get some questions.

### 💡 セクション 21

So should the knife uh be persistent to the database superbase or track locally? No, it's going to be on the database of course. Uh, where should the knife versus gun kill counts as displayed? Uh, we're only going to do the stats panel for now. We don't need anything else.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And should the bot kills on the player also be tracked uh by weapon type? Uh, no, we don't need that. Player kills only. We don't need to track uh that kind of type. Okay.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, then we're just going to submit those answers. And now we're going to flesh out the plan and then we can execute the plan. But I want to show you a trick I use actually before we start executing the plan here. So if you look in the database now you can see we are only kind of tracking yeah I can show you we are tracking wins losses kills deaths uh and that's it and the username. Okay so hopefully now u clo and open 4.5 will uh create a new table that is going to be knife and gun kills so we can keep a state on that too.

### 💭 セクション 24

uh that is connected to the user right okay so now we can see we have our plan okay perfect you can see okay so we're going to do some database writing perfect and everything so instead of just accepting now uh I kind of uh have this habit now that I found out was very good that is just uh do no planning and I'm just going to do like a compact before I actually execute the plan because sometimes it could be a bit annoying if you get this autoco compact in like a big uh feature change in your app. So, I'm I've been just making a habit of doing this. It takes a bit longer, but it kind of saves you on some annoying stuff sometimes. So, I'm just going to do compact and then I'm going to switch back to execute mode and let's do execute plan. Okay, so that was done.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, now I'm just going to go back to accept edits and then I'm just going to say execute plan. And that is basically the workflow I have been using and so far it's been superb. Uh basically the whole game is kind of described uh in natural language. I haven't really touched the code. Uh I've been doing some few adjustments just in parameters uh myself but basically other than that Opus 4 has done the full game so far and that is pretty impressive and that's why it's so addicting using that's why I had to upgrade to the max because I want to keep it going all the time.

### ✅ セクション 26

I didn't really want to stop and wait 5 hours, right? So, I just had to do the max plan because it was so much fun. So, let's just uh flesh out this plan and then we're going to check on the database and give it a shot to see if we actually track our uh gun and knife kills now. Okay. So, the agent has worked through this.

### 📚 セクション 27

So, uh the first thing we want to do is go to our database and do a refresh here to see if we get some new table entries. Uh let's see now. Uh we have wins, losses, kills. Uh, okay. So, we have gun kills and knife kills.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Perfect. Yeah, that is exactly what we wanted to see. That's a great start. So, now we just need to test it out. And for that, I always run this in local before, of course, I push to GitHub and the deployed version.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, let's just refresh this and let's try it out now. So, if we go to my account, uh, yeah, you can see I have uh, gun kills and knife kills 0. I reset this. So, let's just try it out now. Let's try to first do a gun kill.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh let's see if I can do that. Oh god, I got access. Okay, so I got it. Okay, so now next we need a knife kill. But first, let's check if this counted.

### ⚡ セクション 31

That was a perfect head shot. >> Look at you. >> So let's do a count. Okay, so we got a gun kill. Perfect.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Let's switch to the knife now and let's go for it. So then I need to bounce around a lot. Switch up the ramp. Okay, that was a bit lucky. Uh, okay.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, you can see there's a visual bug with the bot here. I I kind of need to fix that. But look at that. >> Nice shot. But make sure to touch.

### 📋 セクション 34

>> So, let's go to the account now. And yeah, we got a knife kill. So, that is up. Perfect. So now we actually can move on to my next implementation.

### ⭐ セクション 35

That's going to be the achievement page where we're going to count the knife kills to 10 and then you unlock a gold gun or something like that. So basically the gist is that uh we're going to create a new uh button in the menu that has this achievements and here we're going to have a list of achievements and I'm describing here uh the achievements to get 10 knife kills. And this is marked as complete, right? You can read all this if you want to have some tracking. I also want a popup if the achievement is completed in game.

### 📝 セクション 36

That's just going to be a one time and investigate and create a plan for this. So again, I'm going to go back to plan mode and let's just start work on this plan here. So uh I'm just going to take you back when um we have the plan and I'm going to execute the the agent here. Okay. So that was the first part of the achievements uh system done.

### 💡 セクション 37

So, let's just check it out before we move on to re the reward part. And uh yeah, uh we're just going to open this in local. Okay. And you can see we have the achievements. Perfect.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And knife master uh get 10 kills with a knife. One out of 10. So, let's see if that is correct. If we go to our account, yeah, we have one knife kill. Perfect.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So now we're just going to remove uh not remove move on to the the reward part. Okay. So if we go here, I have another prompt. So I'm not going to again I'm not going to read out this. Let me just compact this and I'm going to kind of tell you uh quickly what I want the prompt to be.

### 💭 セクション 40

Uh, so basically this prompt is just going to be adding a reward if the player completes the achievement. It's going to unlock a gold knife. Remember, now we only have kind of the standard metal default knife, but uh if the player has completed this achievement of 10 knife kills, uh, now it's going to unlock the gold knife. Okay, so we can select that. So let's see if we can also oneshot this.

### 📌 セクション 41

And I'm just going to paste in the prompt. I'm going to do exactly the same. create a plan, compact, execute the agent, and then I'm gonna come back and then we're gonna try it out. So, we're gonna I'm gonna try to play to get up to the 10 knife kills and see what happens. Okay, so that should be it.

### ✅ セクション 42

We are now pushing to GitHub to actually test this out in production or the deployed version of the game. So, I'm just going to wait for this to uh deploy now and then we're going to try it out and see if our achievement work if we actually unlock the gold knife and we can actually play with it. So, yeah, that was it. So, let's try to refresh the deployed version of the game. Now, I'm just going to exit the local one and yeah, let me check.

### 📚 セクション 43

Yeah, that is deployed. Let's refresh. Okay, so we log in autonomously. Yeah, we have the achievements. And if you look, uh, we have now six knife kills.

### 🔖 セクション 44

I did some testing. So, now I'm going to try to get the last four and then we're going to see if we unlock the the achievements and get the gold knife. Okay. So, uh, yeah, I guess you have to just watch me play and I'm going to put on the sound so you can just watch me play and then we're going to see if I actually can unlock the knife here. >> [music] >> Okay, so now I just think we need one more.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So if I get this now, uh let's see if we get the achievements popping up here. Yeah, we did it. That was the achievement unlocked. So, now we're going to see if we can >> if we can actually unlock this. So, I'm just going to stop this game.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Let's refresh this and let's go to achievements. Yeah, that was done. So, you can see we have the gold knife. So, I'm going to click equipped. Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 47

And let's try a new game now. Okay. And let's see if we have it. Oh, yes. Here's the gold gun.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Not again. Knife. Uh uh. Okay. So, it's working.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Let's see if it works on the kill cams. Yeah, it's working on the kill cams, too. Perfect. Okayoo, that was pretty cool. So yeah, that is basically it.

### 📋 セクション 50

This is how far I've come so far. And I also I have created a YouTube page. I'm going to create in shorts to kind of advertise the game. So if you want to try out this game now, uh you can you don't have to sign up. You can also play as a guest.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Uh it's 360ns.fun. That's the URL. So go test it out and leave a comments if you find any bugs or stuff uh like that. And I'm going to keep working on it. And hopefully on the next game them uh gave their blog uh I'm going to do a multiplayer.

### 📝 セクション 52

Hopefully we have that going and I'm just going to keep building on this game using Opus 4.5 because it's just a fun way to do this. So yeah, hope you enjoyed this uh game day log update. Kind of my first one and hopefully this could get something cool at the end. And I'm going to make like a bunch of achievements. I'm going to make a global leaderboard and stuff like that.

### 💡 セクション 53

and basically working on my first game. So, this would have never been possible with Opus 4.5, Cloud Code, and stuff like that. So, I've been having so much fun this weekend. So, definitely go check it out, try it out, build your own game, and maybe we can share it, find some place, and yeah, but go test out the game if you want to. Uh, you should not, the mobile is not going to work.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It has to be on like a computer. But yeah, thank you for tuning in to the first game blog and I'll see you again hopefully in the next
