## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so I think it's time we talk about this because I've been finding this very effective and if you are kind of into aentic coding, this could be claude code, uh, Gemini CLI, Codeex CLI. I think it's about to take a more indepth look at this. We're not going to do any in-depth look, but basically I'm just going to show you how this works today because I think this could be more effective than MCP servers and I just want to show a bit of how I use it or how you can use it too. So very simple this is you just going to write like a skill.m MD file and here you have a description and you have an instruction right and cloud code has this in context and what I really like about this is that it's very effective since the model knows what this skill is doing. It's very fast at executing that skill.

### 📋 背景・概要

It doesn't need to ask the user a bunch of questions. Do you want to do that? Do you want to do this? Everything is in the instructions and in the descriptions. The description is of course so the model know when to call it and the instruction is what it should do.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

You will see this soon. So let's just uh show you how this works in practice now. Okay. So if you look in my cursor right you can see I have the claw and under here I have something called skills. I have the audio transcriber skill and I have the image generator skill.

### 📝 詳細説明

So if you look at the image generator you can see I have a skill.md file. And here you can see I have the name of it image generator and the description generate images from text prompts using AI. you use when the user asks to create, generate or make an image, picture or illustration. So this is what the you uh model is using to look at the context we have if it's going to trigger the skill. Right?

### 💡 実例・デモ

And then we have the instructions. Just create a temporary script that's going to create the image, run it to generate the image, save the output, delete the script file. So I like this because uh we don't really save any code we generate. We just do a temporary code or a script. uh we run it, we get the image from foul or nanobanana pro and we delete it and then it's gone from our codebase, right?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And we can do the same here on the audio transcriber skill. This is a bit different. Describe uh audio videos, MP3, MP4, right? Uh use when the user asks you to transcribe audio, video or convert speech to text or get transcripts for media files. So let me show you how this works now.

### 🎯 応用例

So, if I go in here to Claude, I'm in my skills directory. And yeah, all I have to do now is say something like, I should be able to at least do this. Uh, I need an image of a big fat seal stranded in Central Park. People are staring at it. Uh, 69 format.

### 💭 考察

And that should be enough. Now, this should be able to trigger our skill since we already have predetermined this. Let me see. Yeah, image generator. See, we selected the skill.

### 📌 まとめ

Perfect. And this just saves us a bunch of time, right? Because we don't have to explain everything. Yeah, we have to do this. Generate a short h temporary script.

### ✅ 結論

You can see we have the prompt here. It did change up the prompt a bit, but okay, we are running the script. We should get the image. We should remove the script again. And we were back to we started, but now we should have uh only the image we asked for.

### 📚 追加情報

The rest of the code, the script we generated, everything is gone. It's removed. and we only are left with the image and that was a skill we wanted to use. So yeah, let's see how this turns out now. Okay, we just do a curl command to get it, download it, and we should have it in our Yeah, CVD here.

### 🔖 補足

And you can see we remove this. Okay, so let's just do open image. And that should be it, right? Okay, here it is. That was pretty funny.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And yeah, we got the image. A big fat seal stranded in Central Park. people are not being very helpful. They're just staring at it. But you can see how effective that was, right?

### 🚀 セクション 14

And that was the that is the the whole idea of skills, right? So, let me do one more example of this. So, I just left out again. I'm going to go in without doing anything. You can see we have a file here called Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 15

in my video. Okay. Video folder. So, I'm just going to say transcribe the file because in the instructions I already told it if there's a video or an MP3 file in this specific folder. You know what to do.

### 🌟 セクション 16

This is your skill, right? Audio transcriber. It knows what to do. If there is a file in that, yeah, it's looking in the directory. It found an MP4 file.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Okay, I'm just going to do what I'm supposed to do here, and that's going to be to transcribe it. So, you can see now. Okay, so we're going to create a Python code to do this. And again, I'm just going to have it remove the code after the transcription is done. Okay, so it's very straightforward.

### 📋 セクション 18

So now it's just going to run this. Everything's going to be autonomous. I don't have to go into more any detail because it knows already what to do. It has the skills to do it from the instructions and yeah, just super effective. Okay, so you can see it was done.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Now it's going to remove the Python code and that should be it. If I go here now, I have the text file. You can see the full video is transcribed with the timestamps I like. Perfect. So again, very effective, very easy to use.

### 📝 セクション 20

When you have set it up, it will always be there. It knows the context. So yeah. So just to wrap this up, let me show you like how easy it is to create a skill. So I'm just going to go into my skills folder.

### 💡 セクション 21

I'm going to call it smiley. Right. Okay. And I need a skills.md. skills uh doskill.md.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Okay. So, you can see skill.md and we have this format here that's going to be Yeah, I'm going to call it smiley. Generate a smiley face uh in ASKI. Right. And yeah, I'm just going to do that.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Generate a smiley face. That is the instruction. Okay. So, we have saved this skill in smiley. Perfect.

### 💭 セクション 24

And I'm just going to exit. Go in again. Clear this claw. And now we should be able to just give me a smiley. And this should Okay, that was spelled wrong, but hopefully it works.

### 📌 セクション 25

And this should give us like a Oski smiley because we created this skill, right? I don't know how it's going to do it, but let's see. And here we got it. So, I didn't say how it should do it. I said just do it.

### ✅ セクション 26

Okay, so that was the skill it learned. The skill it knows now is to generate smiley faces. And as you can see from Simon Wilson's web blog, now you can see he writes, "OpenAI are quietly adopting skills now available in chat GPD and codec cla." So again, I think this is going to be something to look out for in um 2026 because I found this more intuitive and easier to set up basically than using MCP servers. It's much more intuitive. You just have a description, a name, and an instruction.

### 📚 セクション 27

Very easy, simple, and very easy to use. So yeah, go check it out. Super cool thing. I have been using it with cloud code. As I said, you can use it on the CLI now with codeex.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So yeah, try it out. Thank you for tuning in and I'll see you
