## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Now I'm down [music] at the gym. Everything comes [singing] out. >> Today we have a pretty cool workflow. I haven't shared before so I thought I could do it today. So basically what we want to do is go from nothing to a cool music video that we generate with suno.

### 📋 背景・概要

Okay. So basically it's a pretty straightforward setup but let's just go through it. So in step zero we need some kind of image input for this. So we can just use this Nana Banana Pro and create whatever kind of 916 video we want. This could be girl male playing guitar, piano or something like that.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Could be anything. And the next step we want to use Suno. We want to generate maybe some lyrics with Gemini 3. This could be anything too. Pick the style you want.

### 📝 詳細説明

We need to set up something for that. And we end up with the MP3 song, right? So we have the image, the MP3 song from step zero and one. And in step two, we're going to use those to generate the music video. So, I think we're going to use a bite dance model, maybe omni.

### 💡 実例・デモ

We'll see. Put the image in, put the song in, add a prompt, and this should generate a music video. And it's a pretty cool workflow if you like to do this kind of stuff. And it's a pretty simple setup, but I want to create a UI for this so we can make it a bit easier to work in. And we end up with a video we can download and use for whatever you want.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Send it to your friends, put it on online, whatever. So, yeah, let's just do it. Okay, so here are the models we're going to use today. We're going to use nanob pro. Like I said, we're going to use suno API here from uh key AI and we're going to use the biteance omnihuman model.

### 🎯 応用例

So I went ahead I collected some documentation here. So you can see we have Gemini 3, nano banana, omni and suno API. Okay. And I got my keys in ENV here. So uh for the image generation, we're going to use the prompts here.

### 💭 考察

I'm just going to hardcode this now, but uh you can do whatever prompt you want because I want to do we can do artist. So the user can input an artist sitting behind the piano. Uh medium closeup hand remains. Yeah, you get the point. You will see that wet hair rain at stage.

### 📌 まとめ

No people in the background. Or we can do artist holding a instrument at a concert or something like that. And for the video prompt, 4K person singing with emotions, no light change, faces, lens, dead eye contact, handheld, ultra sharp. I just want to do some testing here. So this is what we need.

### ✅ 結論

So next step now, head over to cursor and start start planning out this. So let's just head to cursor and go in here. So the first thing I want to do as always just read the documentation so we are up to date and then I'm going to do my instruction. I don't think I want this application to be too complex. Uh, but I'm going to try to read in my app here now.

### 📚 追加情報

And I'm probably just going to skip it and leave it on the screen so you can see it because it just takes so long. So, I'm just going to use text to speech now to kind of read in uh the app I want here. Okay. So, now you can see the prompt I put in here, right? And yeah, you can see we have 12 steps.

### 🔖 補足

It was a bit all over the place, but basically now we are into plan mode and we're going to try to create a plan for this. Yes, we now have our music video generator plan. You can see I kind of went over this. User input, generate image, generate lyrics, generate music, poll until it complete, download MP3, whisper, transcribe, find chorus, clip 10 seconds, generate video, poll, and display and download. All right, that sounds kind of what we wanted.

### 🎨 セクション 13

We have all the faces. We have all the code we need. And yeah, I'm pretty happy. I'm just going to try it out. We're going to iterate and hopefully this works.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So that was it. So that was the first iteration. So I think we want to try this now. So we're just going to do uh I think we're just going to do it here. Okay.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So let's just do mpn uh rundev and let's go to 3000. Okay. So let's just do localhost 301 was it? All right. AI video generator.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So we're going to name the artist name. Uh we can select a instrument. Uh, I think I'm just going to go piano. Uh, let's just do Taylor Swift. That's my go-to because of all the images we can generate.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, I need a song description. So, I'm just going to keep it simple. Let's do uh let's just do a piano but about to search for meaning in life and nihilism. And for the voice style or vocal style, I don't think this is vocal style. Uh, but at least do a female voice.

### 📋 セクション 18

And I'm just going to grab a style from my suno here. Yeah, I'm just going to grab that. Okay. Paste it in. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So, this is just piano ballad open soulfully. Okay. Okay. So, let's just hit generate music video. And let's see what happens.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, we're going to generate image. We're going to write some lyrics. Create some music. Process audio and create the video. I have no idea how long this is going to take, but I'm just going to keep monitoring to see if we run into any issues.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, yeah, I'm probably just going to speed this up. Uh, and I I guess I'm just going to take you back when this is complete and if it's working. This is looking pretty good. Uh, I just checked all the outputs and we have the image, we have the audio and now we're just going to do the video and hopefully everything will come together to create our music video. So, I think I'm going to add a new feature and that is to kind of bring your own clip or audio clip.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, I think we're going to update that. Uh, but let's just wait for this and see if it works. And if so, we're going to update to you can bring your own image and your own uh audio clip. So, that was complete. You can see this was the Taylor Swift concert image we generated.

### 🎯 セクション 23

And we have the video. So, I think we're just going to listen to it. I'm going to blow it up and let's listen to the clip. We also have the option to download it. We can listen to the full song.

### 💭 セクション 24

We might try to click on that, too. But let's just do the clip here first. I'm going to turn off my mic here now for 10 sec. [music] Chasing shadows, building dreams on shifting sand it always seems. Tell me.

### 📌 セクション 25

Chasing [singing] shadows, building [music] dreams on shifting s. >> Yeah, I think that worked pretty good. Uh, I did a double check. I checked if that was the chorus and it was perfect. That worked first time.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh, we used just the ffmpeg. We transcribed it. We cut out the chorus and we use those 10 seconds in a clip. So that was pretty good. Let's see what happens if we click on full song here.

### 📚 セクション 27

[music] [singing] >> Okay. So then we get the full song. That's also pretty cool feature. We didn't ask for it actually. But yeah, I think we're very close now.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Uh like I said, we are going to add a new feature. So I just generated a plan for bring your own uh image and bring your own uh audio clip. So that's going to be the final thing we're going to try. So I'm just going to implement a plan. Let's upload our clips and see how that's going to work.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Okay. So we have implemented the plan now. Uh we're just going to restart the server. Mpm run uh dev and let's open up the port again. So we're still going to use 3000.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So let's refresh and let's see now. Okay. Okay. So now we can do our create your own video with our custom things. That's perfect.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So I'm just going to find an audio file and I'm going to find an image and we're going to try to kind of skip the generation parts. So this is almost like bring your own image, bring your own audio type of situation. Okay. So uh now I'm just generated like an image myself. It's basically the same image, but I just wanted to see if we can upload this.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Let's grab this. Okay. So we have the image. And I also have a short clip from another suno. I think it's this one.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Okay, so that's about 10 seconds. And let's see what happens now if this works. Create video. And hopefully, yeah, we kind of skipped the whole part there. That was pretty neat.

### 📋 セクション 34

I like that thing. So now we went straight to video. So I'm just going to let this run and let's see how this turned out. Yes, it worked. So that's pretty cool.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So now we can bring our own, right? So yeah, I guess I can just play this too. Uh, if you want to see how it turned out, I wouldn't say it was perfect, but it is working. Okay, [music] >> everything comes out. [singing] [music] >> I think we could work a bit on the prompt, make it more engaging in the singing part.

### 📝 セクション 36

I'm not quite sure. I might check that out. Okay, so I just wanted to see uh I tested out a new model and I actually think this is better. So this is the Creative File Aurora avatar model. So I think this might be better.

### 💡 セクション 37

Uh I guess I could show you the results here. So maybe we should have used this model instead. Uh but I'm not going to go through the whole app again, but let me just show you the results from this model here. [music] Everything comes out teenage [singing] if I can't now I'm down crying at the gym. [music] Everything comes out [singing] teenage.

### 🔧 セクション 38

>> To be honest, I think that's better. Yeah, I think so. So, I might explore a bit more on this Creatify Aurora model instead. So, yeah, pretty interesting uh what we looked at in the beginning, right? So this was kind of our setup.

### 🎯 セクション 39

We have the nana banana pro suno lyrics song and put it together in the music video. You see I left out a few technical steps here like the ffmpeg to find the chorus and stuff like that. But this is something if you want to build a version of this you can kind of adjust yourself right what you want it to be. Uh but I think this is a fun workflow and there's a lot of other stuff you can build around this. It doesn't have to be music.

### 💭 セクション 40

Can be other things too. But uh definitely recommend checking this out how you can do this and just play around with it. I have other ideas for we can push into the pipeline. But uh this is what I wanted to do today and I'm happy with the results. So hope this gave you some inspiration and I'll see you again tomorrow.
