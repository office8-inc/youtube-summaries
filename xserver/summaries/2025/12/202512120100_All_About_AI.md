## 💡 概要

この動画では、Claude CodeとOpus 4.5を使用して、わずか10分で個人用の動画編集ツールを構築するプロセスを実演しています。動画の無音部分を自動的に検出・削除するWebアプリを、ffmpegを活用して作成します。音声レベル（dB）や無音の長さなどのパラメータを調整可能にし、編集後の動画をダウンロードできる機能を実装。AIツールを使えば、特殊なニーズに応じたカスタムツールを短時間で開発できることを示しています。動画編集ソフトを使わずとも、自分専用のツールを簡単に作れる時代になったことを実感できる内容です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **10分で専用ツールを構築**: Claude Codeを使えば、複雑なコーディング知識がなくても、わずか10分で実用的な動画編集ツールを作成できる
- **実用的な無音削除機能**: 10分47秒の動画から6分の無音部分を検出し、56%を削除して4分44秒に短縮。パラメータ調整で音量閾値（-30dB）や無音の長さ（0.8秒）をカスタマイズ可能
- **Vercelスタック＋ffmpeg**: シンプルなWebアプリとしてVercelスタックを採用し、動画処理にはffmpegをローカルで実行。UIとして音量スライダーを実装し、直感的な操作を実現
- **友人にも共有可能**: UIを備えたWebアプリとして作成するため、同じニーズを持つ友人にも簡単に共有できる。コマンドラインツールだけでなく、使いやすいインターフェースも提供

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Today uh I want to build a tool uh in like web app format that I want to use myself. So basically this should be pretty simple. Uh the user should be able to upload a video file or ampp4. And what the feature is going to be is that we're going to use ffmpeg here to detect any silence parts because when I do some recordings a lot of the video is silent. So I want to remove those chunks and for that we need some parameters like we can set the dB how silent it should be or maybe how many seconds of silence before we remove that right and at the end of the app it should be pretty straightforward we can just download the edited video without the silence and that is pretty straightforward tool I want to use so I just want to take you kind of through the full workflow how we do this very easy using uh cloud code and opus 4.5 so in my cursor here you can See, I have a source directory with a test clip.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, basically, this video is uh kind of the videos I use when I record these YouTube videos. And a lot of them has these long silent parts, right? Because I record, I wait for code and stuff like that. So, this video is 10 minutes and 47 seconds. So, this is a perfect video to try to cut out some of the silent part.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, let's just head over to Yeah. So CD video tool and let's do claude and let's just go into here and I want to use text to speech now to try to describe what the tool is going to do. Okay, so we want to create a simple web app. Uh I think we can just use the versel stack and what we want this uh simple web app to do is that the user can upload a video file MP4 for example and this video file often has the silent parts in it. So we want to use ffmpeg to remove those silent parts uh with some parameters.

### 📝 詳細説明

Maybe we can set the db level of the silence uh add a default and also we can do like a parameter where we can select the total amount of seconds of silence before we remove that chunk. So maybe if there's two seconds of silent remove the chunk right on both ends. And yeah that is basically the feature. And after the video has processed, the user can download the edited video. This is only going to run local now.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So we're going to run ffmpeg locally. So don't think about that or any hosting. So yeah, uh create a plan for this tool. So you can hear it wasn't perfect, but if we go into plan mode now, we should be able to generate a plan from this. And we might might get some questions and stuff.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So let's see how this turns out. So now you can see um Claude code has done some exploration with like a sub agent. It used haiku 4.5. So now you can see we kind of get these questions here from claude code. Uh something I'm a really big fan of because this we can have some more input here into the plant.

### 🎯 応用例

And this should mean that we have our plan ready in like a few seconds I think. Yeah. So, I could of course go over here, but this should be pretty straightforward with the test inputs. And the default is going to be minus 30 dB and two seconds of silence. And we have a range here we can adjust.

### 💭 考察

That looks pretty good. And yeah. Yeah, I like this. So, let's just go ahead and let Cloud Cold uh make this plan for us. and I will take you back when uh this is ready for testing.

### 📌 まとめ

So let's do the local host local host 3000 and okay let's find our clip. So let's check here. Yeah, clip is here. Let's upload that and let's see now if we have some Yeah, we can do some slidings here. Noise threshold 30 uh we can do 30 dB five we can do.8 eight, I think, or something like that.

### ✅ 結論

And now we're going to first detect the silence just to check the audio clip if there is any silent in the clip. And if we find any silence, uh, I guess we're going to record that. And then we can just use ffmpeg to remove it. Yeah, we found six minutes of silence. That's pretty good.

### 📚 追加情報

And output is going to be about 444. You can see 56% will be removed. And we have all the segments. So, let's just click. This should be pretty quick now when we know all the segments.

### 🔖 補足

This Wow, that was very fast. So, now we can download. Okay, we have the video. Let's open it up. Does it work >> in two?

### 🎨 セクション 13

>> Yeah. >> Pro the video with 25. >> Yeah. So, now there's no silent in the video. So maybe this was not the most interesting tool to build, but for me this is a useful tool I can use in my editing.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I saved me some time. Of course, there are probably stuff in Premiere Pro you can use for this, but uh this saved me some time if uh and the the most important thing is that this is like a specialized tool that I can cook up in like 10 minutes just using cloud code and Opus 4.5 or any other AI uh tools, I guess. But uh you don't even need a UI. You can just use ffmpeg to get the command. I know that.

### ⚡ セクション 15

But uh if you wanted to do this for a friend maybe or something like that, it's pretty simple as long as you know what kind of tools you need to use. So yeah, I thought it was pretty cool. Maybe this gave you some inspiration tool you can use in your workflows. So yeah, bit busy today. So that was all I had time for.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Thank you for tuning in. I'll see you
