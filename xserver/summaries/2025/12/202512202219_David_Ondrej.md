### 🎬 導入

For a human, doing something like this might be super easy. A robot couldn't even imagine doing something like that. That would be impossibly hard for a robotic arm to do, but any 10-year-old kid can do that. No problem. And that is because humans have so many input tokens coming in.

### 📋 背景・概要

People don't realize how much training they've done. They think that a child is not being productive in the first few years of their life. Actually, a child is being extremely productive. A kid is like looking around their hands. They're testing things.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They're moving object. It falls trying to like move their body. They're learning physics. They're getting bunch of input tokens through their eyes, bunch of audio tokens through their ears, and they're improving massively, right? The neuroplasticity of a child is insane.

### 📝 詳細説明

And the average human can become much smarter than an LLM by the time they're 18 with way less tokens. Like tens of thousands of times less, maybe millions times less tokens than these foundational models. If you look at any of the top models right now, there's like tens of trillions of tokens going into these models. and they still aren't as useful as a college student intern that you can hire at your company and you can do like all kinds of tasks, right? So humans are much better at the generalization than these AI models, which means there's still a lot of efficiency gains to
