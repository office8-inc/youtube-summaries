## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, this was Conway's game of life, but on a 3D spherical planet. So, notice as generations, it has [music] asteroid impacts. I did ask for asteroid impacts. It did decide to >> [music] >> uh add it in there. Tons of options including various bloom strength, bloom radius, threshold, exposure, tons of stuff.

### 📋 背景・概要

We have the speed at which it's running. We can change kind of the resolution. Wow, that's kind of nuts. [music] And there's tons of more 3D options to kind of rotate the Earth in various ways. We have meteor intervals, meteor seeds, etc., etc.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Tons of controls. We're able to pause and unpause the simulation to look closer to it. You can go a step at a time. And here's if I start shooting. This is kind of what that looks like.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, as you can see here, it's actually like a bounce bouncing off the building. the the whatever this is, a machine gun, minigun. Things are actually bouncing off the building when I'm I'm shooting it and it's blowing up. It It's looking good. >> Thanks to Framer for powering this video.

### 💡 実例・デモ

More on them later. >> OpenAI just released a GPT 5.2. Now, it really sounded like a lot of people thought it would be just a small incremental step forward, but that's not what GPT 5.2 is. You feel it right off the bat. Let me show you what I mean.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, here's one of the first prompts I gave it. Notice that right now it's actually still running. I did an iteration. So, it's running doing that right now in the background. It's been running for about 10 minutes.

### 🎯 応用例

So, notice it's 5.2 Pro. And notice how long it thought about this prompt. 55 minutes and 13 seconds. I asked it to create a 3D city destruction game. You float around, there's buildings, you shoot, they blow up, you get a high score, whatever.

### 💭 考察

It goes off for an hour to put everything together. By the way, for other similar tests that I've been running, it doesn't just return code in that code box. It returns a a zip file, right? You download the zip file, you unzip it, and it has, you know, the project folder, and it has all the project files you need to execute. It's got a little template for how to to run it.

### 📌 まとめ

This no longer feels like a prompt and answer. This feels like handing off a project. That's not the weird part. Are you ready for the weird part? Look at this.

### ✅ 結論

So, this is pro enabled, right? But if you if you click here, look at that. This isn't even its final form. There's an extended thinking time available. Now, if you're wondering if I built that game, yes, it one-shot that game with destructible environments, multiple weapon sets, the ability to fly around a city, blow stuff up, high score, has sound, lighting.

### 📚 追加情報

It took an hour to produce the entire game on the standard setting, not the extended setting. I haven't even I just realized that's even in there. I'm kind of scared to touch it. Maybe when I go to sleep, I'll run an extended thing, go to sleep, and see what it comes up with in the morning. And this new heaft, it comes through in one benchmark in particular.

### 🔖 補足

And as you'll see, a lot of very respected people in the AI space are are are pointing this out. We'll come back to the thing that it took an hour to do, but this is related. This is a different way of looking at the same thing that I'm telling you. So, here's Ethan Malik. He's saying, "Wo, this new GDP values Brown.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So he's a researcher at OpenAI X Meta did tons of amazing work in the space. He's saying in my opinion GDP val is the most important result from this GPT 5.2 launch. Now we covered GDP val on a previous video back in September 25th when it came out. If you missed the one, you might be wondering what is this GDP val? Why is everybody saying that it's the most important thing ever?

### 🚀 セクション 14

The reason why it's so important is because it's a benchmark that is measuring the performance of our models on realworld tasks. And by the way, as you'll notice, it's not just their models. And I got to give a lot of credit to OpenAI for this, as you'll see in just a second. Quick note to all the founders and builders. Watch me ship a real production ready site in minutes with Framer.

### ⚡ セクション 15

No developer needed. Framer is a noode builder made for businesses. Think Figma style canvas, but it publishes a real website. Exactly what you design is what goes live. It's trusted by fast growing teams and it's built for speed.

### 🌟 セクション 16

You get the essentials. CMS aka content management system to run blogs and pages. AB testing comparing two versions to see which one wins. Localization that translates everything for new markets. Plus live collaboration so the entire team edits together.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Let me show you how. idea to live. Let's open up a blank project and use wire framer to help us whip up something fast. I have this billion dollar startup idea. We combine two things that the internet just can't get enough of.

### 📋 セクション 18

AI news and pictures of cats. So, we prompt wireframer create a landing page for a newsletter signup by getting daily AI news plus a daily cutest cat picture. Notice this kills dev handoff, meaning that marketing can ship the sites themselves. It's enterprise ready too. Staging environments, role-based access control.

### ⭐ セクション 19

You choose who can edit or publish. Automatic SSL encryption, DOS protection, and strong SEO and analytics out of the box. The result? Launch full sites or campaign pages in minutes instead of weeks. Your engineers focus on product.

### 📝 セクション 20

Your growth team owns the website. Or if you're a oneperson team, this allows you to do it all at ludicrous speed. Boom. I'm done with my super slick landing page. I expect us to have a 100% opt-in rate.

### 💡 セクション 21

Now you're up. Ready to build a site that looks handcoded without hiring a developer? Try Framer free using the link below and use the code Wes Roth for a free month of Framer Pro. And now let's get back to the content. So, I have to warn you, the paper we're going to look at is white background.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, it's definitely going to be a flashbang effect as we switch to that from this dark mode. But what it looks like is various occupations, various projects that those people might do across different sectors, backgrounds, occupations, from software developers and lawyers to registered nurses and mechanical engineers. Switching to light mode, flashbang. And here are some examples of these tasks. So basically when we're trying to understand how well these models are able to do realworld economically valuable tasks obviously benchmarks they kind of give us an idea but they don't really translate into being able to do work.

### 🎯 セクション 23

I'm sure there are kids out there that can ace all sorts of tests but then put in a real environmental to actually get something done will be completely useless and vice versa. And we can think of jobs as basically kind of this hierarchy where at the bottom is kind of individual skills like being able to use Excel to make a chart or being able to use Photoshop to combine several images and text on some specific format. And all those skills should hopefully sort of combine so that the person can finish projects. And then at the top is kind of like the job which is you know being able to do finish all those projects plus a whole bunch of other miscellaneous stuff. So, we've seen these AI models kind of do those individual skills.

### 💭 セクション 24

Yes, they can design an image. Yes, they can craft an email. Yes, they can write this or do that. This is moving one level higher and saying, can they actually complete entire projects? And not completely brain dead projects either.

### 📌 セクション 25

For example, here it's a manufacturing engineer. So, in that sort of sector or profession, you're supposed to design a 3D model of a cable reel stand for assembly line. So, I'm assuming some sort of a AutoCAD thing. It's a little bit hard to tell, but they do have the descriptions down below. But the the final sort of deliverable is this.

### ✅ セクション 26

It's the actual model, the overall design with exploded view of components, right? So, and you can't just hallucinate everything. It has to be real. And part of this benchmark is verifying that it's real. We'll get to that in just a second.

### 📚 セクション 27

Another example is a financial investment analyst, for example, might be asked to create a competitor landscape for last mile delivery. or a registered nurse might be asked to assess skin lesion images and create consultation report. You've probably had some experience like this where you went to the doctor or wherever they took a look at whatever was troubling you. They kind of thought about it. They connected dots and they gave you like I think it's this kind of similar.

### 🔖 セクション 28

They're going based on images and an experienced human would deliver this. Again, we'll get to how they're great in just a second, but there's tons of projects like like this and as you can see, they're not brain dead simple. They're not necessarily rocket science, but they're also not entrylevel projects. These need an experienced professional in that field to complete. Create an intro reel of video and audio.

### 🎨 セクション 29

You know, dealing with a dissatisfied customer. Create a week-long luxury Bahamas itinerary for a family of four. Optimize table layout for spring vendor fair. Design a sales brochure for new property. I mean, all these you can imagine people doing this right now.

### 🚀 セクション 30

There's people right now creating sales brochures for all all sorts of stuff. It has to contain images and text and it has to be right. It has to have certain specifications. It can't to be wrong. Another example is audit something with Excel.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So being able to audited data, make sure it's correct, there's no discrepancies, etc. And how the benchmark works is that both humans and LMS try to complete those projects. And then this benchmark they they hire experts, right, in that field. They're industry professionals, right? They have to have a minimum of four years of professional experience in their occupation with a strong resume and with a demonstrated history of professional recognition, promotion and management responsibilities.

### 🌟 セクション 32

That's just the minimum. The average expert that they had, you know, checking these projects had 14 years of experience. They have to pass a video interview, background check, training quiz, blah blah blah. The point is, you know, they had the judges, the human judges that they had here, they were real legit people that knew how to grade these projects, how to rate them. These are people that worked at, you know, Bank of America, BBC News, Boeing, Budget, Rendicar, Capital One, Centers for Disease and Prevention, City Group, Conte Nast, CVS Pharmacy, US Department of Defense, E Trade, FTC, Google, Goldman Sachs, HBO, IBM, Johnson and Johnson, I'm done.

### 🎬 セクション 33

You get it. These are legit, respectable companies, right? And Wells Fargo is also on the list. And so these industry experts with all their experience working for these companies, 14 years on average of working experience, they grade both the projects that were completed by AI by large language models as well as projects that were completed by industry experts. They graded them blind, so they didn't know if they were looking at AI outputs or industry expert outputs, human outputs.

### 📋 セクション 34

And here were the results. So basically the top of this chart is wins and ties. The darker blue is wins only, right? So basically this top model either won or tied with human industry experts 47.6% of the time. The reason that I want to give props to opening eyes it wasn't their model it was cla obus 4.1 their model their best model at the time GPT5 high came in at 38.8.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So the headline is that these models did not achieve parody with industry experts with humans. They're approaching it but they're not there. Keep in mind this is September 25th. But as we see over time from June 2024 till now, right, that that curve is is heading up. It's getting closer and closer and closer.

### 📝 セクション 36

And in the previous video, I said pay attention to this, right? Because at some point it's going to cross. It's going to get better and it's going to get much better fast. Once it starts crossing line and getting better, things will start changing. I think that's fairly self-evident.

### 💡 セクション 37

Imagine you have two remote employees. You give them projects, right? And over time you find that employee A consistently just outperforms employee B. Whatever project you give them, they come back with better answers, better graphics, better whatever it is that you're trying to do. Assuming you're paying them the same rate, you're probably going to give more projects to that employee because they just produce better results.

### 🔧 セクション 38

You might even consider, you know, letting go of the underperforming employee. What if you later find out that that employee that kept doing a better job is actually a large language model and can do that job for a fraction of what the other person did it for? the incentive is even more skewed. Now imagine if this happens across most jobs in most industries. Okay, so a few months ago the best OpenAI model did let's call it 39%.

### 🎯 セクション 39

They either won or tied with humans only 39% of the time. The best model available called Opus 4.1. Call it 48% right? It won or tied 48% of the time. So close but no cigar but you know instead of cigar catastrophic job loss.

### 💭 セクション 40

Okay so remember those numbers. Here's the new and updated GDP valp 5.2 Pro clocks in at 74%. So it was at 39% a few months ago and now it's at 74%. So it's not as good as humans to just way better most of the time or more precisely I should probably say. So it's one over humans experts in the field right 60% of the time.

### 📌 セクション 41

But 60% of the time the results were better. Those industry professionals with 14 years experience, they they looked at and 60% of the time they're like, "This work is better." That worked happened to be AI. And then 74% of the time it either won or or tied. There was no difference. So that's a GPT 5.2 Pro.

### ✅ セクション 42

Again, that's that model that hammered away at, you know, my little silly prompt for it to create a little shoot them up game. You know, it reasoned for 55 minutes for almost an hour. And again, standard not extended thinking mode. So I hope it makes sense why a lot of these people are saying that this is a very important metric to pay attention to. Right?

### 📚 セクション 43

So Nome Brown of OpenAI saying this is the most important result. And I'm sure some people be like, "Yeah, but he works for OpenAI." Right? Ethan Malik doesn't work for OpenAI independent third party saying it's a very big deal. So let's quickly look through the actual benchmarks. What do we achieve?

### 🔖 セクション 44

So at the top the most important one is GDP value. GDP of course is a metric to track the entire gross domestic productivity of a nation. Total economic activity total output consumptions investments government spending and net exports is not necessarily the best metric to track productivity across the board but it's a pretty good one for for a lot of use cases. I mean if you think about it if a lot of diseases are solved for example GDP would actually take a hit right there would be less money spent on treating disease. So there are certain situations where maybe that's not the best metric.

### 🎨 セクション 45

But in terms of just output, producing stuff, GDP is a good metric. And when AI is worst at humans at producing economically valuable work, it's likely that, you know, there's a small fraction of a nation's GDP that is sort of produced by AI. And I just mean the actual like the output, the projects, the work completed by AI. But once it gets better than the average human expert, well, we're kind of into this unknown territory. I mean, if you think about the fact that, you know, within the first hour of GPT 5.2 going live, I barged it with a tons of prompts like this.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Here's almost an hour. Here's about half an hour of reasoning. 20 minutes, 20 minutes, about half an hour. Here's 20 minutes. 20 minutes.

### ⚡ セクション 47

You get it. Those were, by the way, just the first prompt. Some of those had iterations. But if I wanted to get that much sort of work done without Chad GBT that would probably translate to hours of work by a software engineer. So with this reduced demand for engineers probably not in that field.

### 🌟 セクション 48

I think the need for good high quality code is pretty elastic right we might produce a lot more code if we can produce highquality code cheaply. But there are probably a lot of industries where demand for human labor will take a hit. That demand will be destroyed. And if this metric GB val is to be believed and hopefully I I I showed you why it's it seems like a pretty good metric. It seems like they were able to establish how to track those results.

### 🎬 セクション 49

I I feel like fairly intelligently. It's kind of hard to dismiss it as nonsense. They're paying people with a lot of experience with managerial experience to decide which one is better. Those are the people that will be deciding which which projects and which workers will be working on those projects at real jobs at those companies. And in the last few months, we went from where humans were in general better than large language models to now humans are in general worse.

### 📋 セクション 50

There was also an improvement in SWE Pro, an improvement in SWEBench verified, a pretty good leap here in GPTQ, a diamond. And I feel like as these metrics get saturated, it's kind of hard to tell, right? Because you're just like inching up, you know, a few percentage points as you're getting to 100%. But these are, you know, pretty good leaps across the board. AM 2025 no tools went from 94% to 100.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So interesting results with Frontier Math. The other big thing that stands out is ARGI 1 and ARC AGI 2. So they are verified. So they're verified by the ARC AGI people to say, "Yep, this is this is correct." But again, a lot of these benchmarks, I mean, tons of respect for ARGI Frontier Math is interesting. aime I mean they're they're good benchmarks but I feel like more and more people are just not as excited about these models creeping up those benchmarks.

### 📝 セクション 52

We are a lot more interested in how it translates into real life effectiveness. By the way, shout out to AI safety memes and uh Rob Wiblin. We see a lot of this commentary from I don't know who it is, economists also probably some lay people. They're somehow completely convinced that all of this AI stuff is going to disappear any second now. Just around a corner, poof, and it's gone.

### 💡 セクション 53

Right? The AI bubble pops and all these models cease to exist, progress not just stops, but as they say here, right? Somewhere after this like exponential curve of models ability like as it starts to really get going, you know what the next obvious thing that's going to happen is? You know, if we just projected a few years forward, well, immediate inexplicable permanent decline to all the, you know, AI capabilities, this curve, maybe it continues on its exponential. Maybe it starts flattening out of more of an S-curve.

### 🔧 セクション 54

We're not quite sure yet. The future will tell, but we can pretty safely bet on the fact that this is not happening. As OpenI was testing these models on the GDP eval, one judge commented, "It is an exciting and noticeable leap in output quality. It appears to have been done by a professional company with staff and has a surprisingly well-designed layout and advice for both deliverables. Though with one, we still have some minor errors to correct.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Here's the example from GPT 5.1 to GPT 5.2. Notice the leap. Here's a cap table 5.1 to 5.2. So, a lot of highlights in red that were incorrect. Here, everything is correct.

### 💭 セクション 56

5.2 completed all calculations correctly and in an auditable way. So, it's doing it in a way that can be audited later and it can also probably be really good at doing the audit. And here's a jump from GPT5 to GPT 5.2 in terms of project management. The other I think important thing to understand here is kind of these intelligence curves as they're called. So, we're beginning to see more and more companies kind of like draw these curves out.

### 📌 セクション 57

So, on the yaxis, so up and down we have the thing that we're trying to measure, like how good is it at the thing? And then on the x- axis, as we go further to the right, we're letting it burn through more and more tokens. We're we're spending more money to let it think at length about the prompt. So a good way of thinking about it is like intelligence kind of per dollar. The more you're willing to pay for the model, for for its work, for how many tokens it uses, the the better it is, the more intelligent it is at doing that job.

### ✅ セクション 58

And each company, whether that's Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, XAI, they all have kind of a few models along here across that intelligence curve. So you'll be able to kind of like pick one depending on what you need. And each time they release a new family of models. You can think of that as kind of like moving that intelligent curve that way. Right?

### 📚 セクション 59

So here, this might be Pro and this might be thinking, this might be Mini or whatever. This one is like the standard one. Sometimes the names get changed around. I guess this is instant. Google Gemini, they have their their flash models, they have their pro models, etc.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Winthropic, of course, it's Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku. So, I'm kind of combining the thinking budget and the size of the models kind of into one chart. I hope that that makes sense, but it's just a way to think about it. So, this it general represents the smart it is, the more money you expect to pay. Each model can draw kind of this line, this curved line, and then put out a few models along that curve.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, I mainly look at like the best of the best. So like the pro model, thinking mode, whatever that that's that's the one that had that big leap on GDP of Val. But of course, there's tons of use cases where you don't need the best of the best. You need something cheaper, right? Use cases where you just need lots of volume.

### 🚀 セクション 62

The important thing about this is it also reduces the cost quite a bit. There's a lot of algorithmic and non-algorithmic improvements that drop the cost of doing certain things. Here's Sam Alman. as this model gets released, he's saying 390x cost reduction in one year, right? So, we're talking about almost 400x cheaper, right?

### ⚡ セクション 63

That's kind of insane. Where else? What other industry do you see prices for doing something dropping that much? Is it 400 times cheaper to build houses yeartoear or to get healthcare or anything? No, we don't really see that.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Even with digital stuff, with software, seeing a reduction of 400x in one year is still in insane. You don't really see that. It's uncommon. By the way, help me settle a bet. When somebody says not uncommon, when somebody says something is not uncommon, does that mean it's common?

### 🎬 セクション 65

Does not uncommon equal common? Does that mean the same thing? Is it like math where like these things cancel out and then common equals common? or is there some other logic that completely eludes me? But Sam Alman is referring to this chart.

### 📋 セクション 66

So, as you can see, GPT 5.2 Pro X high, so extra high is like what is that 90 91%. So, I'm guessing this is that mythical mode that I showed you where where this GBT 5.2 Pro high that's where it thinks for now. We can also kick it up a notch into extended. Maybe that's XI. I'm wondering, but it it gets over 90% as far as you can tell on the ARC AGI.

### ⭐ セクション 67

So that's also kind of an important thing to understand as it's zooming past us in the ability to complete certain economically valuable tasks. We are also seeing at the same time a pretty big reduction in cost over time. So one year ago, OpenAI 03 high, right? So it scored 88% on this evaluation, but it cost quite a lot of money. $45,000 per task.

### 📝 セクション 68

Few days ago, there was this take Katherine Everett. She's saying, "People don't know how Chad GBT works. It doesn't know things. It autocompletes sentences. It makes things up." And she was quote tweeting this person, Charles C man.

### 💡 セクション 69

Just visit the nearby university library and was fascinated to learn the students are bombarding it with requests for references that do not exist. The product of Chad GPT and its ilk. It's a goddamn nuisance. the librarian said they don't believe it's all made up. So, if you've been watching this channel for a while, you probably know that I've been for a while now talking about like kind of, you know, getting ready for the things that are coming.

### 🔧 セクション 70

I always said that while I'm very optimistic about where things are going in the long term, in the kind of the the short to medium-term, things might get ugly, things might get bumpy. We did an interview with Immod Mustak not that long ago. He is a a great person to listen to about these things and kind of like a prediction for what's coming. He's one of those very like multiaceted people that seems to know a lot of things across disciplines. I think he was ex hedge fund.

### 🎯 セクション 71

He also started stability AI and now he's working on kind of like this next thing which is kind of the economic impact of AI. So when we ask them what do all the people that are like the billionaires that that he knows that he hangs out with that are kind of following the stuff what are they thinking what are they preparing for for like what do they expect from the future they are also preparing and talking about it and and thinking about it they're worried about kind of like how the transition is going to happen and he also walks us through a calculation of how incredibly cheap it's going to be to replace human labor and he he actually walks you through kind of like the economic step-by-step breakdown of exactly what's going to happen. You kind of realize that things are going to change in a big way and we don't really have some solution to it quite yet. A lot of people are thinking about it, working on it. There's not like one plan that's like, oh, here's what we do, you know, when all human labor goes to zero.

### 💭 セクション 72

Some Alman has a plan. We've covered that on this channel. I stack is talking about it. Tons of other people are talking about it. But the point about this post is it does feel like on one side we have a lot of people that are following AI that are like man big things are coming.

### 📌 セクション 73

And there's also kind of this this other side that's skeptical and are saying nothing will change these large language models. They just they don't know anything. They make things up. By the way, I think it's fair to say that every single thing that she says here is it technically accurate. People don't know how Chad works.

### ✅ セクション 74

Very true, right? It doesn't know things. It it completes sentences. Very true. It it makes things up.

### 📚 セクション 75

Also, you can kind of say is true again depending on how we define these terms. What I think people fail to realize is just how similar our neural networks up here in our brains are to these digital neural networks. So, people keep saying that it's just an fancy autocomplete. It's a stoastic parrot. I don't think that means what you think it means respectfully.

### 🔖 セクション 76

It's not whether it knows or doesn't know. It's not if it's making it up or not making it up. It's the accuracy that counts. We don't know what's going to happen in the future, but if you can accurately make up scenarios about what might happen and invest accordingly, if you're accurate, you can make billions investing. And some people do.

### 🎨 セクション 77

But if you separate people into those that think that big changes are coming versus those that think that AIs just are incapable of doing anything of value, either one side or the other side will have a very rude awakening and very soon. But in terms of the tests that I've ran on this new open eye model again using pro you know normal thinking normal meaning you know 20 to 30 to 55 minutes of thinking here are some of the outputs that it did again keep in mind a lot of times like I said it would return zipped files you'd have to unzip it then it would have all the project files in it so this was uh Conway's game of life kind of showing a cellular automata but it was supposed to be on a 3D spherical planet so notice as generations it has asteroid impacts. I did ask for asteroid impacts. It did decide to uh add it in there. Tons of options including various bloom strength, bloom radius, threshold, exposure, tons of stuff.

### 🚀 セクション 78

We have the speed at which it's running. We can change kind of the resolution. Wow, that's kind of nuts. And there's tons of more 3D options to kind of rotate the Earth in various ways. Or I guess this is not Earth, but whatever planet this is.

### ⚡ セクション 79

We have meteor intervals, meteor seeds, etc., etc. Tons of controls. We're able to pause and unpause the simulation to look closer to it. You can go a step at a time. Clear, hide, HUD, paint, add life, erase, toggle camera wheel, zoom, etc., etc., etc.

### 🌟 セクション 80

One shot at this. Here's the prompt. It reasoned for 24 minutes and 1 second. And so, notice it gave me the download file. So, this wasn't a zip.

### 🎬 セクション 81

It was just the single HTML file. Some of the other ones had a whole project that you had to download and even proposed some more stuff you can add like commissions, scoring, etc. There's a few issues I did run into and I think it just really has to do with 3JS. So, I do want to do a full video where we dive into the stuff. I ran into some issues that are very easily fixed if if I knew that they were issues, if that makes sense.

### 📋 セクション 82

One of those issues was if you asked for changes, I'd be like, "Oh, here's like 50 different, you know, lines of code to change instead of returning the entire file." That's easily fixed just by making sure you say just return the entire file. So, for example, if that city destructing game, right? So, I wanted more light from buildings and from the sky. I wanted the ship to move a little bit faster, weapon one was good, but the rest of them, they were a little bit too bright and too close to the screen. They kind of cluttered everything.

### ⭐ セクション 83

And as you can see, each prompt takes a while to complete. So, if I knew this, I would have also added just put everything into one file. Otherwise, it it goes and does a peace meal. But this is the game that I created. Again, one shot.

### 📝 セクション 84

This is before those second editions that I did, right? You have a after burner. You're able to strafe. You can go up and down, look around, fire. There's four rockets.

### 💡 セクション 85

There's points and combos and various powerups. It even has a tip here. Rockets plus barrels equals chain reactions. So, here's kind of what that's looking like. So, as you can see here, we're in a city.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Moving left and right. Really has this cool effect of it's like shifting the camera. It's got some floaty stuff. So, as you can see here, you know, this is what the next thing that I would be working on is adding textures to the building is adding some sort of lights. It just needs more lights.

### 🎯 セクション 87

But the controls feel good. Shift is the after burner. Space and control moves you up and down or C, I guess, moves you down. This does have sound. It's hard to capture the way I'm recording it, but I I'll have a clip with the sound in it.

### 💭 セクション 88

And here's if I start shooting. This is kind of what that looks like. So, as you can see here, it's actually like a bounce bouncing off the building. The the whatever this is, a machine gun, minigun, things are actually bouncing off the building when I'm I'm shooting it and it's blowing up. It It's looking good.

### 📌 セクション 89

The entire buildings get demolished. This is what weapon two looks like. It shoots this fireball or whatever. This is a nuclear explosion of some sort. Very, very bright.

### ✅ セクション 90

And this is what I mean. This is what I wanted to change is is is there's not not enough light in the game world. And those shots are super bright. So, it makes it very, very hard to see. So, but those are little things.

### 📚 セクション 91

I mean, everything is great about this. It's just little tweaks that need to happen. Here's weapon number three. Again, same thing. It kind of like blocks your vision.

### 🔖 セクション 92

But again, this is the next iteration. This will be fixed. And when you're done, you know, it gives you your final score. Here's another one that I asked for that had a visualization space of some of the biggest kind of like cosmic structures you could have or anything from sci-fi or games like the biggest mega structures that were inspired by the largest constructs in science fiction and fantasy. Notice I can change the bloom, the glow.

### 🎨 セクション 93

I can change the field of view which is pretty cool. And let's do the autopilot demo. So this was the first generation that it did. This is kind of like the oneshot result. It does have some issues again with the lighting with kind of like the bloom effects, but you can see these massive structures.

### 🚀 セクション 94

I mean, they're there. They're rendered. It's kind of insane that you're able to kind of see them in real time. They're moving in space. A lot of this is very impressive.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Again, I think the big issue here is again since it's not actually looking at the output, it can't know what it looks like, right? So, it's just writing code and then hopes that it looks good. So, for a lot of this stuff, you need to go back and tweak how it's supposed to look, the lighting, etc. This is where I kind of ran out of time again because I needed to make sure that I saved include all one file. And then each sort of addition takes a while.

### 🌟 セクション 96

And we can warp to the Dyson segment. So, some portion of the Dyson sphere. And here it is. So, that's an actual sun. And this is a a portion of the Dyson sphere that's catching this electricity.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Again, it's hard to see because of the lighting, but with a few iterations. This is what I want to do a separate video to really showcase this because a lot of this would be easily fixed here. It built a orbital elevator. So, as you can see here, there's a planet down there down below. And this is kind of that elevator that's going all the way to the top to that thing.

### 📋 セクション 98

Pretty pretty impressive, I got to say. Again, just one shot creates the entire 3D world. That is the tree of life or rather the world tree I guess as as it's called. We also have a neon spire city. Pretty impressive.

### ⭐ セクション 99

We have a fortress mountain and a void gate. And we're able to travel between these locations using warp, etc. So, I don't know how awesome this looks to you. To me, this is very impressive. It just the lighting is bad.

### 📝 セクション 100

So, I do have to tweak it. But the sheer amount of stuff that it's able to build that you're able to fly around and experiment with like the reflections off the sun and stuff like that. There's a lot here that's very very impressive. Keep in mind this thing has only been out for a few hours. Some of these prompts take, you know, almost an hour to complete and a few back and forths can be, you know, 20, 30 minutes, etc.

### 💡 セクション 101

So, the initial results, I mean, I would say are kind of good. They're kind of mind-blowing. Anyways, I think I'll leave it here. In my next video, I'll try to have everything sort of more presentable because there's a lot to see here. But based on these kind of early results, I mean, what do you think?

### 🔧 セクション 102

Is this impressive? It building out these massive structures in a space that you're able to fly around doing it in one shot, creating something like this fairly easily with tons of options. And again, as we iterate on it, it seems like there's a lot more functionality that we could add. And the fact that we can even give it more juice to think about it more to create more stuff. I mean, what's your take?

### 🎯 セクション 103

Do you think this is a significant step forward? It's hard to compare to Gemini 3 Pro because I feel like it really progressed kind of in a different direction than Gemini 3 Pro. It's hard to compare the two because this goes deep and spends a lot of time and creates. Gemini 3 Pro is still a little bit more back and forth. It's a little bit faster.

### 💭 セクション 104

It's a little bit more like normal AI chat bots with amazing results, but still a little bit more what we're used to. This feels completely different. And this feels like an AI system. You give it a task and you just go away and you let it finish it. And what do you think about the GPT val, right?

### 📌 セクション 105

So, do you agree with Ethan Malik and No Brown and I guess myself as well that this is a massive and meaningful jump from under 40% win rate to 70 plus? Anyways, let me know in the comments more coming very very soon. If you made it this far, thank you so much for staying and watching.
