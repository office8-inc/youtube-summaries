## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

My name is David Andre and here are the best AI business models for 2026. So, the world is changing. AI is improving faster than ever. New tools and new models are being released literally every week. In 2025 alone, there have been hundreds of different models and tools released, and it's only getting crazier.

### 📋 背景・概要

This is the greatest industry to be in, period. We're in the middle of the largest technological revolution in history. The first industrial revolution began in 1760 with the advent of the steam engine. The second one began in the 1870s with the Bessemer steel converter. The third one began with the transistor in the 1950s and now we're in the fourth industrial revolution which started in the 2010s with deep learning.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And it's no secret that AI is simply incredible. First, you can build software by typing in plain English. You can generate hyperrealistic images from a single prompt. You can achieve perfect texttospech understanding. You can execute complex agentic tasks just like humans would.

### 📝 詳細説明

And that's only the beginning. None of this was possible just 24 months ago. As Ilia Saskcover, the OpenAI co-founder said, "The thing which I found most surprising is that it actually works." So, you can see that the AI revolution is truly a once- ina-lifetime opportunity. And all the smart money realizes this. All of the top players have decided to go allin on AI.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Elon Musk stopped working at Doge and started focusing on XAI. Jeff Bezos is betting big with his project Prometheus and over 100 billion invested through Amazon. Meta was hiring people for nine and 10 figures, poaching people from other companies for insane salaries. And Google got their co-founder Sergey Brin to be at the company every single day working on Gemini. Now, in business, there's this concept of capex, which stands for capital expenditure.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It's the money a company spends on big long-term stuff, buildings, equipment, infrastructure. In this context, in AI, it's mostly data centers, servers, GPUs, AI chips. And here is how much money big tech is spending on capex. Microsoft 80 billion, Amazon 125 billion, Google 85 billion, Meta 72 billion. So the message is clear.

### 🎯 応用例

Big tech understands that AI is the future. There's more money going into AI than anywhere else. And we can see that just by looking at the market cap on Nvidia, which is bigger than all of big pharma combined. The time it takes to generate wealth is rapidly accelerating. In the oil industry, it took 57 years for the first billionaire to be created, which was John D.

### 💭 考察

Rockefeller. In the tech industry, with the advent of personal computing, it took 12 years for the first billionaire to appear, Bill Gates. But in the AI industry, just in the last 2 years alone, there have been 29 new billionaires. That's right, 29 billionaires in just 24 months. That's more than one new billionaire every single month.

### 📌 まとめ

As MIT researcher Andrew McAfee noted, going back over 100 years of data, we have never seen wealth created at this size and speed. It's unprecedented. And my own experience matches this. I've built one of the biggest YouTube channels in AI. I've met tons of incredible people over the last few years.

### ✅ 結論

I went from making $600 a month to over $100,000 a month in less than two years. I've interviewed dozens of top AI experts, entrepreneurs, and developers. I've built one of the largest AI communities in the world. I built my own startup with zero web development experience, which has been used by over 67,000 people up to this day. all while traveling the world and working on my own schedule.

### 📚 追加情報

But you're not here for my story. You're here to find out how AI can change your life. So here is what I'll tell you today. How do different AI business models compare against each other? And which is the best AI business models to start in 2026.

### 🔖 補足

See, choosing the right business model is like choosing the right fishing spot. You could be the greatest fisherman in the world, but if there's no fish in that spot, you will leave empty-handed. Or you could be a terrible fisherman like me. But if you choose the right spot, you will still catch plenty of fish. And that's a real story.

### 🎨 セクション 13

By the way, business is the same. Choosing the right industry and the right business model is everything. See, many of you do everything right except work on the right thing. Choosing the right business model in the right industry improved my life significantly. So, I know this works from experience, not theory.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, in this video, I'm going to help two types of people. Number one, the newcomers who want to get into AI. you need to take the leap and get involved in AI in some way. I promise I'll give you clarity on how to get started today for free. So, you're going to want to stay until the end because I'm going to deliver on that big time.

### ⚡ セクション 15

You have my word. The second type of person I'm going to help in this video is the builders, the entrepreneurs, the go-getters who want to scale their business. I'm going to show you what the best AI business model is and why. I'll give you practical, actionable ways to implement AI into your company. And later on, I'll share the key lessons I learned from my last three years in AI.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, buckle up. And yes, this video will work no matter if you're old, total beginner, non-technical student, retired, super busy, or a slow learner. All you need is the ability to speak English, access to internet, and a computer. That's it. So, we've established that AI is by far the best industry to be in, and that succeeding in AI doesn't have to take decades.

### 🎬 セクション 17

In fact, all of the people who built a successful AI business have one thing in common. They follow the same set of principles, a proven system that anyone can follow. And it took me over 3 years to realize what this system is and over $150,000 in experiments. And I'll give it to you today in this video completely for free. However, most people will not reap the benefits from the AI revolution.

### 📋 セクション 18

By 2030, 14% of workers will be forced to change their careers because of AI. Actually, it's quite simple. If you don't adapt, you will get replaced. So, most people will completely miss out on the AI revolution. And some of you already know what that feels like.

### ⭐ セクション 19

You saw the internet revolution, or you saw the social media revolution and the insanely fast growth of those companies, or you saw the Bitcoin wave and how it went from less than a dollar to over $100,000 in just one decade. And now you wish you took part in these technological revolutions. We all know what it feels like to miss a massive opportunity that in hindsight we should have jumped upon. And guess what? AI is that opportunity.

### 📝 セクション 20

In fact, missing the AI revolution will be even more painful because this technology is far bigger than anything that came before it. So, I would highly recommend you block out the next 40 minutes and pay close attention because in this video, I'll show you exactly what I'm doing to not only survive the AI revolution, but to thrive in it. First, let's start with some clarity because the AI field can be overwhelming. You're probably wondering which tools or models should I use? Am I building the right thing?

### 💡 セクション 21

Is my job or industry safe? Am I too late to this? How do I actually adopt AI into my life? Am I technical enough for this? Which business model is the best?

### 🔧 セクション 22

How do I even get customers? How do I keep up with all the change? Where do I even start? It's totally normal to ask yourself these questions. Every single person in the AI space has felt this way at some point.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Many of us still feel that way, myself included. This is simply the reality of living in a rapidly changing world. So don't beat yourself up for feeling this way. In fact, it's good you have these thoughts because as Ray Dalio said, the famous billionaire and hedge fund manager, if you're not worried, you need to worry. And if you're worried, you don't need to worry because if you are already worried, you would do the work to prepare yourself to stay ahead.

### 💭 セクション 24

So what separates the winners in AI from everyone else? And what is the number one reason why so many people fail in the AI field? The answer is simple. It's the business model they choose. See, over the past two years, I've seen literally thousands of different individuals try hundreds of different things because I run one of the largest AI communities, which gives me a unique perspective on the entire playing field and what works and what doesn't.

### 📌 セクション 25

And there's a very clear pattern that emerged. The people who struggle to succeed, the people who get stuck and cannot scale all had a suboptimal business model. Now before I talk about which business models are suboptimal and what actually is the best AI model for 2026, let's define what makes a certain business model suboptimal. And there are four main failure factors. Number one, time freedom.

### ✅ セクション 26

How much free time will you have in a typical week? Number two, recurring revenue. Whether you need to constantly hunt for new clients or whether your current clients pay every month. Number three, long-term exit. Can this company be sold or not?

### 📚 セクション 27

And number four, future proof. Will this business model even exist in the future or will it get replaced by better and better AI? So, let's analyze the most popular AI business models against these four factors. First off, AI automation agency, also known as AAA. When it comes to time freedom, this is a 2 out of 10 because you have to do custom builds for clients that require way more work and time that anyone likes to admit.

### 🔖 セクション 28

When it comes to recurring revenue, it's a four out of 10 because it's mostly projectbased. So, you always need new clients. If you do a good job, some clients will return, but most of the time you need new clients. Long-term exit is one out of 10 because there's zero hope of your agency ever getting acquired or sold because it's so heavily reliant on you working in the business. Plus, the churn for the talent, aka your employees and your customers is very high, meaning there is no recurring nature and you constantly need to hire new people and you constantly need to attract new clients.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And when it comes to future proof, it's a three out of 10. You're doing what AI will inevitably automate because as the AI models get better themselves, less and less people will outsource to third party agencies. And this is the big AAA lie. I would say this is the most insidious business model in all of AI. Not only does it fail on all four criteria, but most people who are teaching this business model are doing so in bad faith.

### 🚀 セクション 30

See, over the past 2 years, I've met 15 to 20 different AI agency owners, and every single one of them wants to quit or pivot to something else. More on that later. The next business model is AI content, aka faceless channels. Time freedom. This is actually six out of 10 because a winning piece of content can generate revenue for months to come, especially if you find an entire winning format.

### ⚡ セクション 31

But before then, you must run a lot of experiments. When it comes to recurring revenue, this is two out of 10, however, because ad revenue fluctuates widely based on your views. And I know this from experience from running multiple YouTube channels. Plus, AdSense is very unreliable source of income. When it comes to long-term exit is just as bad.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Two out of 10. Extremely low chance of you ever selling a YouTube channel, especially one that posts AI generated content. And future proof, three out of 10. Everyone has access to the same AI tools and platforms like YouTube, Tik Tok, Instagram are actively cracking down on lowquality AI slop. So, you have to constantly keep testing and experimenting to stay ahead.

### 🎬 セクション 33

In fact, my own experience backs this up. In the past, I've actually ran a very successful faceless channel myself, which was generating between 20 and 30,000 a month every single month. So, I know this business model inside and out. And for the first two years of this YouTube channel, I was making between zero and $200 a month, which is not enough to even survive. Plus, it's much more work than it seems because content creation is a hyper competitive space and it's becoming more and more competitive by every passing day.

### 📋 セクション 34

The next popular AI business model is freelance AI developer. Now, time freedom. This is pretty good. 7 out of 10. You can choose your clients.

### ⭐ セクション 35

You can work your own hours from your own location. This gives you solid flexibility. But again, you're still trading hours for dollars. When it comes to recurring revenue, this is a three out of 10, however, because it's either hourly or project based. Repeat clients are very rare, and when the build is done, so is the paycheck.

### 📝 セクション 36

You're basically a glorified gig worker. Long-term exit is even worse. One out of 10. You are the business. There's no assets to sell.

### 💡 セクション 37

The day you stop developing, it's over. And future proof, it's a bit better, but still three out of 10 because you're essentially competing with cursor or cloth code while being 100 times more expensive than these AI agents, which are also getting much better much faster. And again, this is not theory. The data backs this up. According to Brookings Institute analysis, the contract volume has declined since CH GBD was released and the earnings growth trajectory has dropped by 5% for the freelance economy.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And according to the official data from the CIO, recent US computer engineering graduates have a higher unemployment rate than the national average baseline of unemployment, which doesn't make the business model of being a freelance AI developer the most appealing. Next up, we have AI drop shipping or AI e-commerce. Now, time freedom, five out of 10. Pretty solid. Once you find a successful product and highly converting creatives, your business can run nicely and largely automated.

### 🎯 セクション 39

But finding that untapped product, however, is very difficult. When it comes to recurring revenue, one out of 10. Every single sale is a one-time transaction. There's no subscriptions, no retainers. You're on an endless treadmill of paid ads, sale, repeat.

### 💭 セクション 40

Long-term exit, however, 6 out of 10. It's possible to convert a drop shipping store into a proper e-commerce brand. However, this requires very high margins, contacts with suppliers, worldclass advertising, and lots and lots of skill. But if you ask how future proof this business model is, I have to say two out of 10 because your suppliers are essentially now your competitors. And you can just look at Timu, Sheen, Tik Tok shop.

### 📌 セクション 41

These are cutting out the middleman and letting consumers buy for couple dollars the same thing that drop shippers did five or seven years ago. And here's the logic. Drop shipping and e-commerce takes a lot of capital to start up. You need to run paid ads. You need to create creatives.

### ✅ セクション 42

And you need to test different products. And by the way, this is another business model that I've actually done myself. I've spent over three years in the ecom space. I've sold watches, face slimming masks, but knives, cat toys, seed cushions, just to name a few of the products that I sold. In fact, before I ever did YouTube, I used to make video creatives for drop shippers, which showed me just how ruthless this business model can be.

### 📚 セクション 43

Over those three years, I've worked with hundreds of different e-commerce stores from all niches imaginable, and less than 5%, again, less than 5% managed to build a successful, profitable store. This is a terrible business model for beginners. Next up, we have day trading with AI bots. When it comes to time freedom, 8 out of 10. Really solid because in theory, the AI bot can make the trades for you.

### 🔖 セクション 44

In practice, you still have to build the bot and manage its behavior so that you don't go bankrupt. When it comes to recurring revenue, one out of 10 because there is no revenue. You are merely making trades and the results of those trades can be positive or negative depending on your skill. When it comes to long-term exit, two out of 10 because you can't really sell a trading bot since if it actually worked profitably, why would you sell it? And the potential buyers who might be willing to acquire your company already know this.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Also, this business model is not future proof at all. You're competing against Citadel, Renaissance, Two Sigma. These are Wall Street firms with hundreds of billions of dollars and PhDs that are optimizing every single nancond. So what I'm trying to say is that you will get crushed. This business model is beyond dangerous.

### 🚀 セクション 46

And what makes it ultra risky is that the worst outcome isn't just not making money. Like with the other business models, the worst outcome is losing all of your money. According to a peer-reviewed study in the review of finance, researchers tracked every day trader in the Brazil's future market which actually is the third largest market in the world. And of the traders who stuck with it for over 300 days. So these are not the quitters.

### ⚡ セクション 47

These are the people who actually stuck with it. 97% of those traders lost money. Only one in 200 traders made more than a regular bank teller. And just like every single man thinks he could win in a street fight, every single man for some reason thinks he has some superior trading strategy that nobody else is realizing. This of course is total delusion.

### 🌟 セクション 48

If there's one business model that you should absolutely avoid, it's this one. So to summarize, building an AI agency is extremely time demanding. Everyone I know who's doing it either wants to quit or pivot to a different business model, AI content. The revenue is entirely dependent on your views, which fluctuate wildly. Plus, the competition in content creation is insane.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Number three, AI freelance development. You're essentially going against AI agents that cost $10 or $20 a month. That's a losing strategy. Number four, AI drop shipping. This requires high investment upfront, which a lot of beginners cannot afford.

### 📋 セクション 50

Plus, apps like Teu or Tik Tok shop have already captured the market and built a monopoly. And number five, day trading with AI bots. This is ultra risky and you're competing against Wall Street. You have a chance of losing everything. So, as you can see, most AI business models are not as sexy as your favorite guru would like you to believe.

### ⭐ セクション 51

And this is the reason why most people fail. They pick the wrong business model. The gurus teaching these sub-optimal business models are selling you a lie. And most of them aren't even doing the business models that they teach. And even the few that actually do those business models often are trying to pivot to a different one.

### 📝 セクション 52

One that scales without you, gives you time freedom, and gets stronger as AI advances. So, my goal with this video is to teach you everything you need to know to succeed with AI in 2026. So, if you watch until the end, you will know how to pick a business model that suits you the best and how to actually get started. And if you've already tried to build an AI business in the past and it didn't work, don't beat yourself up. As Warren Buffett said, it doesn't matter how hard you row, it matters which boat you get in.

### 💡 セクション 53

Which begs the question, what boat should we get into? What AI business model is the best one to start in 2026? Is there a business model that doesn't fail the big four factors? Well, if you want to become an Olympic swimmer, you should study the most successful swimmers. If you want to become a great runner, you should study the most successful runners.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So, let's look at what the most successful AI companies have in common. The first case study is a company named B 44. This was founded by Maros Schlommo at age 31, and he completely bootstrapped Base 44 with his own money. He used AI tools and agents to build his software faster. And six months later, he had $250,000 users and was able to make $189,000 in profit in a single month.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And this resulted in him getting acquired. That's right. Base 44 got sold to Wix for $80 million cash. The second case study is NA10. Yan Oberhauser, the founder of NA10, started it as a side project.

### 💭 セクション 56

It literally began as an open-source repo on GitHub with no monetization. All of which was in a field with existing automation software. What Jan did is he built a better product leveraging AI agents. And recently Natan raised $180 million at a valuation of 2.5 billion. Here's the third case study.

### 📌 セクション 57

Loveable. So the founder of Lovable, Anton Osica, built an app called GPT Engineer over the weekend and it went viral. 50,000 plus stars on GitHub which he then rebranded to lovable. He launched that on November 2024 and in eight months he was able to hit 100 million ARR annual recurring revenue. And keep in mind that this is faster than OpenAI with Cursor and every other software company ever.

### ✅ セクション 58

And today lovable is valued at $6 billion. Now I've personally talked with the founder of NA10 and a founding engineer at Lovable and I can honestly say they are regular people. Most people when they hear that will be filled instantly with many limiting beliefs, but a select few of you will get inspired by this and take action. I'm making this for the select few. And just to drive the point home, here's another case study from Levels.io aka Peter Levels.

### 📚 セクション 59

He makes $3.5 million per year with his multiple software startups. And the best part is AI writes 80 to 95% of his code. And he has over 90% profit margins because he has almost zero overhead. and he has no employees, no investors and no office. And case study number five is Vectal.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Veal is my first software startup. I built it in 2 months with zero previous startup experience. And of course, I used AI agents to help me build the software itself. And keep in mind, when I started, the AI models were much worse than they are today. And in total, I can honestly say that over 99% of the code is written by AI.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, because I move fast and because I leverage AI agents, Vectal was able to hit a peak of $155,000 in ARR. Oh, and I've documented everything since day one in the new society. Now, you might be thinking, what do these companies share in common? Software. Software is the common pattern across all of these success stories.

### 🚀 セクション 62

These companies turned AI agents into software. And this is what allowed these startups to scale super quickly without large dev teams or years of experience. So let's look at the software business model and how it performs on the big four criteria. Number one, time freedom. I would say this is 8 out of 10 because once the software is running, it scales without you.

### ⚡ セクション 63

But it's not passive on day one. You have to build it. There's bugs. You have to add new features, stuff like that. Now, recurring revenue, 9 out of 10.

### 🌟 セクション 64

This is why startups use the term MR and ARR. It literally stands for monthly recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue. Now, when it comes to a long-term exit, 10 out of 10. Software companies have some of the highest multiples ever on acquisitions unlike other business models. And future proof 7 out of 10 because if you integrate AI properly into your software, it gets better as the AI models improve.

### 🎬 セクション 65

And here's the logic. Software skills like nothing else. You build it once and you can sell it infinitely unlike other business models like agency. And because all these apps I just mentioned turned AI agents into software, it auto evolves as AI models get released. So if OpenAI releases a new model, you just update it in your app and all of your customers have a better product without you doing any real work.

### 📋 セクション 66

On top of that, software can also have incredibly high margins if done correctly. Anywhere between 70 and 98% profit. And thanks to AI agents like Codeex and Cloth Code, it has never been easier to build software. And this is exactly why I'm doing this business model myself. I'm revealing exactly what I'm doing, how I'm doing it, and why I'm doing it.

### ⭐ セクション 67

And my plan is to triple down to focus on software even more. Building an AI software company is the key to creating a scalable 100k per year business. And it's now attainable even without traditional coding skills because AI writes the code for you. Software is what allows me to work from my laptop and travel the world. Software is what allowed my startup to scale from zero customers to over 70,000 users in less than a year.

### 📝 セクション 68

Software is what lets me work as little or as much as I want. Software is why regular people are building multi-billion dollar companies at record speeds. So if AI is the best industry to be in and software is the best business model, how do we build a successful AI software company? Well, you do what all the other successful software companies are doing. You build an AI agent and you turn it and package it into easy to use software.

### 💡 セクション 69

Now building software doesn't mean you have to be a professional developer. Times have changed. The rise of AI coding has made building software easier than ever before. But instead of just talking about it, let me prove it to you. I'm going to show you just how easy it is to build a full stack web app with a single prompt written in plain English.

### 🔧 セクション 70

So I'm going to use cloth code for this and I'm going to paste in the prompt and just hit enter. Single prompt like a paragraph long and it's going to build everything from scratch. Let me just read the prompt I sent. Build a complete runnable full stack mini Calendarly demo app. So, we're going to try to build a Calendarly clone in a single prompt with cloud code.

### 🎯 セクション 71

And I'm just going to let it run and do a time lapse. And you can see for yourself just how easy it is to build software. So, there we go. That was like 6 minutes 20 seconds. And again, I had to hit enter for some of the more risky commands, but cloth code built the whole project.

### 💭 セクション 72

You can see the whole file structure. And it even did some tests. So, let's see if it works. And there we go. Here is our mini Calendarly clone.

### 📌 セクション 73

Zero errors. Everything in a single prompt working web app with event creation. I mean, yeah, this is basically a Calendarly competitor created from a single paragraph written in plain English. Guys, we're literally living in the future. So, as you can see, the problem isn't how to build an app.

### ✅ セクション 74

The problem is knowing how to monetize and scale it. And I know that because I've taught it to hundreds of people in my community. I even taught very successful entrepreneurs that all of you will recognize how to build AI agents. So, let me give you all of the lessons and mistakes I've learned from building my first AI startup, which by the way, I managed to scale from zero to 155K RR in just 4 months. And let me tell you, I wish I had these lessons 13 months ago when I first started because they would have saved me countless hours, thousands of dollars, and lots of confusion and stress.

### 📚 セクション 75

So, here is free advice number one. Launch as fast as possible. This is essential. Do not delay. Don't wait 6 months.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Set a deadline 30 days and just launch. Free advice number two. List out all of the assumptions that go into your startup like people must have this problem. They're willing to pay for this problem. They're willing to pay for it every month and many other assumptions that you might not even be aware that you're making and quickly validate or invalidate them.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Focus on reaching product market fit above everything else. Do not get attached to your idea. Simply experiment. Talk to potential customers, see what issues they have, and try to reach product market fit as fast as possible or try to figure out, okay, maybe this doesn't have product market fit and move on as fast as possible. Free advice number four, watch your customers use the app in front of you.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Guys, this is a cheat code. If you simply sit down a potential customer or a current customer and you watch him use the app in front of you, you will see so many things like UI that isn't clear, buttons that are hidden, which features they're actually using. I mean, this is literally priceless. figure out how you can do this every single week and your app will improve exponentially quickly. Now, you might be thinking, David, these tips are great and all, but I don't even know what to build.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Well, for that, I have three pieces of advice. Number one, if you're not sure what idea to pick, read the book 0ero to1. Number two, choose an industry or a field where you already have experience. And number three, start every single day by writing down five new startup ideas. No matter how good or bad they are, just do this every single day and you will have 150 startup ideas by the end of the month.

### 🌟 セクション 80

If you do these things, your odds of picking a successful idea greatly increase. Okay, but what if you don't have a large social media following? Well, neither did these builders. Number one, Patrick. Patrick is one of the members in the new society, and he managed to make $8,000 with just 30 subscribers on YouTube.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Number two, Agent Zero. Jan, the founder of Agent Zero, didn't have any following when he started the project. AgentZero grew organically through GitHub and school communities. Example number three, NA10. The founder of NA10 also did not have and still doesn't have a large social media following.

### 📋 セクション 82

He simply built a great product that turns AI agents into software. Now, yes, having followers helps, but it's not necessary. There are many other ways to get customers for your software company. But David, I don't know how to get customers. Well, here are some of the methods that currently are working for software companies that are getting tons of customers.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Organic content, paid ads, UGC, which stands for user generated content, influencer marketing, cold outreach, product hunt, niche communities, SEO, referrals, just to name a few. Here's a case study that proves the point. Cal AI. This is a calorie tracking app that uses AI to calculate the calories. And the two founders did a very clever influencer marketing campaign.

### 📝 セクション 84

They contacted over 150 micro influencers in the fitness niche which is relevant to their product and because of this they managed to reach $12 million in ARR in just 6 months with over 5 million downloads. Here is another successful AI company with a very different strategy v.io. Their mechanism was SEO search engine optimization. So what they did is they created separate landing pages for super specific granular tasks and search terms like add subtitles to video or video to text or compress video or remove background noise. All of the features of their product and by doing so they managed to bootstrap their way to $7 million ARR and over $1.5 million monthly organic visitors to their website without any large marketing budget.

### 💡 セクション 85

Here's a third example. Midjourney. They launched entirely on Discord with no website and no ads. And the growth came from people sharing insane looking images on Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc. So they scaled purely from word of mouth.

### 🔧 セクション 86

They launched in 2022 and by October of that year it was already around $50 million per year revenue run rate. So as you can see, there are many different ways to get paying customers. So what all of us should do is pick the strategy that makes the most sense for our product and our industry. And it helps a lot if someone experience helps you craft a personalized go-to market strategy. But the main thing is this.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Getting customers is much easier if you build a unique software product that solves a specific problem for a clear target avatar. Because if you have a clearly defined target audience, finding them is 10 times easier. Let me give you one more example just to prove it to you. So lang chain had a totally different way to get customers. They built a free open source repository on GitHub and let developers build on top of it.

### 💭 セクション 88

And this way they went from a solo open source project to a unicorn valuation which is over $1 billion in valuation of your company and over $10 million in annual recurring revenue in under 2 years. And their strategy was very simple. Give away all of the code. Let people use it for free. Just own the ecosystem and let others do the selling for you.

### 📌 セクション 89

And here's a bonus tip on how to get customers. Thanks to the release of Nano Banana Pro, we can now use AI to help us create marketing materials like logos, banners, creatives, landing pages, and anything else you can imagine. This makes getting your first few paying customers easier than ever before. But David, I don't have much time to do this. Well, you don't need much time.

### ✅ セクション 90

Thanks to AI agents, you can work as little or as much as you want and from any place on Earth you want. See, the business model of turning AI agents into software gives you the most time freedom out of all the business models. And that's because you build it once and it just works. No matter if you have one customer or 1 million customers. In software, there's this concept of TAM.

### 📚 セクション 91

This stands for total addressable market. This is the maximum revenue opportunity if a product captured 100% of its market. And AI has the biggest TAM ever, aka the biggest wealth creation opportunity ever. But don't take my word for it. This statement is from A16Z, the most successful VC firm of all time.

### 🔖 セクション 92

Now listen, I get it. All of this talk about software can be intimidating. So if you are not technical, this is for you. First off, I want to say I know how you feel because I was not an experienced developer when I launched my first startup. But then I realized that the current AI coding agents are much better than most people realize.

### 🎨 セクション 93

You can literally ask CL code or Codex to do nearly anything and they will do it. But the secret is this. You can use AI to upskill yourself. Yes, having AI agents do your work for you is great, but what the smart people are doing is using AI to make themselves ultra smart. So perhaps me and you should do the same thing.

### 🚀 セクション 94

And by the way, you can do the same upscale process with business knowledge. So if you don't have a lot of business experience, this is for you. The reality is that you can only gain real business experience by building a business. And the only way to build a successful AI business is by starting. Listen, as cliche and cringe as this sounds, simply starting and not quitting really is half of the battle.

### ⚡ セクション 95

But on a more practical note, here is some real unfiltered advice I have for the firsttime founders watching this. Number one, focus. You must focus on a single product, single business, and a single idea. Number two, deep work. What you need to avoid above all else isn't scrolling social media and, you know, wasting time.

### 🌟 セクション 96

That's obvious. You need to avoid the distracted busy work. Checking emails, checking Twitter, scrolling your calendar, messaging with people endlessly. This is the death, the busy work. You need to work in 60 to 90 minute segments of pure focused deep work.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Number three, you need to get the first paying customer ASAP. This is so huge. So many founders delude themselves that have that they have a great idea and that, you know, they already talk to people and it's good. Listen, until you have the first paying customers, you might be wasting your time. If people will tell you anything, they will tell you the product is great.

### 📋 セクション 98

But if they actually pay for it, that's how you know that they actually want it. And number four, always work on the current biggest bottleneck. Ask yourself with everything you're doing in business, what problem is this solving? If you cannot clearly answer this question, you should probably work on something else. And that really is the key to being effective in business.

### ⭐ セクション 99

You need to ignore all of the good ideas, all of the thousands things you could be doing that are good and solid 7 out of 10, 8 out of 10 to focus on the one thing that solves the biggest problem in your business, the biggest bottleneck, the biggest limiting factor. Work on that one thing and ignore everything else. But what if you have a 9 to5 and still want to do this? Well, if you have a full-time job, this is for you. This is one of the most common excuses wannabe entrepreneurs make.

### 📝 セクション 100

There are countless of ultra successful people that started while having a nine-to-five job that consumed most of their time. The only possible answer to this question is working either before or after your main job. It's as simple as that. Patrick Collison built Stripe while being a full-time college student. Yan Kum built WhatsApp while working 9 to5 at Yahoo.

### 💡 セクション 101

Jack Dorsey built Twitter while working full-time as an engineer. So if these individuals are able to build multi-billion dollar companies while still having a 9 to5 in the early days, I think you are able to build a startup that gets to 100K a year while having a full-time job. And one of the ways to do that is by practicing time blocking. So simply block out two to three hours a day every day to work on your business and make this time block non-negotiable. I don't care what your wife says.

### 🔧 セクション 102

I don't care what your kid says, your neighbor invites you to a barbecue. You time block that time to work on your AI company. And I've seen people succeed with as little as 45 minutes per day. I've seen others do this while raising four kids. What matters is consistency.

### 🎯 セクション 103

If you really cannot find 90 minutes a day, maybe you don't want it bad enough. See, the only skill you really need is knowing how to use AI. Soon enough, AI is going to be doing all of the actual work. Us humans will be simply managing and directing teams of AI agents. And this is obvious when you're reasoning from first principles.

### 💭 セクション 104

Number one, a company is just a group of workers. Each of those workers do a few different workflows in their jobs or positions. And each of those workflows is simply a series of different tasks. So the future of work is building, improving, and overseeing workflows that different AI agents are executing. Now, let me be clear.

### 📌 セクション 105

Using AI doesn't mean only using Chad GBD. This, in fact, is the definition of settling, of being mediocre. You must develop an habit of testing one new AI tool per week at least. But don't be constantly tool hopping. A lot of newcomers aren't sure which tools to use and they hop from tool to tool, never mastering anything.

### ✅ セクション 106

Just pick your core three or four tools and master them. Here are some good choices. Cloth Code, Cursor, Cordex, Perplexity, Agent Zero, Nano Banana Pro, just to list a few. Another common excuse is, "I'm too old for this." This is one of the funniest excuses out there because most of the people in my paid community, New Society, are in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. And here's some proof.

### 📚 セクション 107

Boom. One call. Here's another call. Here's another call. And keep in mind, these are the most active members in their 40s, 50s, and 60s.

### 🔖 セクション 108

And I think that this is because people over 40 actually remember how impactful the internet was, and they don't want to miss out on another technological shift. So, no, you are not too old for this. I've personally seen multiple guys over 70 crush it in AI. Another common myth is, "But I don't have any investors." Listen, this has to be the biggest Silicon Valley scam ever. Access to AI models is cheaper than ever before.

### 🎨 セクション 109

A $20 subscription to Curser or Chad GBT gives you everything you need. Really, raising money before you have any signs of product market fit, and any real traction is just in most cases. And let me prove it to you. Here are just a few of the successful AI companies with zero initial funding. Number one, Vectal.

### 🚀 セクション 110

I didn't take any investment and refused all offers. Number two, Agent Zero. No VCs, no angels, totally bootstrapped. Base 44, also fully bootstrapped by Mau, the founder. Number four, mid Journey, $200 million revenue, completely bootstrapped, zero outside investors.

### ⚡ セクション 111

So, no, you do not need VC funding. In fact, you should delay raising money for as long as humanly possible. And this actually is advice that people gave to me, people who have built successfully as startups. Almost all of them tell me to delay raising money until I actually need it. So, how come all these AI software companies are succeeding without investors, without many employees, and faster than anything before?

### 🌟 セクション 112

What is their secret? The answer, they all follow a proven system. A set of laws for scaling software businesses. A proven system is a repeatable list of steps that anyone can follow to achieve a specific outcome validated by others who have already succeeded using it. And by the way, it took me over two years to figure out that such a system even exists.

### 🎬 セクション 113

And here is why it matters for you. Without a system, you will waste months guessing what works. Without a system, you'll burn thousands of dollars on experiments that already failed for others. But with a system, you can skip straight to what has been proven to work. And the best part, you don't need to be a genius.

### 📋 セクション 114

You just need to follow the steps. In fact, many of you are too smart for your own good. you're overthinking every step and never getting started. The software scaling laws work whether you're technical or not, whether you're funded or not, and whether you're experienced or not. So, can you now see why turning AI agents into software is a great business model?

### ⭐ セクション 115

Can you see that you don't need to be technical to do this? Can you see how AI agents can build the software for you? And can you see that the issue isn't building something, but rather knowing how to scale it? Now, let's say you're fully ready to start, but you still don't know how to actually acquire paying customers or turn an MVP into a real profitable business or scale to $100,000 per year. So, what now?

### 📝 セクション 116

What do you do? Well, you have two options. Option number one, do everything on your own. This is certainly possible, but it takes a lot of time. Option number two, follow a proven system.

### 💡 セクション 117

This way, you avoid painful mistakes, save money, and increase your chances of success. Now, the issue is that most programs or accelerators want your equity. They also require full-time commitment. They don't provide hands-on support and they don't guarantee any results. And so, after scaling Vectal to 70,000 users, I realized that I had built the proven system that I wish I had when I started.

### 🔧 セクション 118

And since many of you also want to build a $100,000 per year software company, I decided to make it public. And so, I'm going to compete with Silicon Valley by launching my own accelerator.
