## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Is this new file format revolutionary or stupid? Tokenoriented object notation or tune is like JSON but human readable and much shorter. The point is is to reduce the context length. So as you can see right here, JSON is 412 characters while tune is 154 characters. And of course, the internet went absolutely crazy over this, and someone came up with an even better spec called values separated by comma, which reduces to 36 tokens.

### 📋 背景・概要

Now, buddy over here thought he ate with this, but bro, literally [music] forgot the headers and the whole ID column, so no wonder is so much smaller. Now, something I do like about Toune, which I don't know why the name tune is pissing me off, but I like how it explicitly gives the number of objects it contains. So, if you just run a simple header query, then you get the amount of objects. And also, I did a test. I took this JSON object that they specified here, which is 92 tokens, minified it, and it took like half the amount of tokens off of it, which you can make the argument, hey, this isn't readable.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

But like why do you need to read it? If it's asking you to do a function call for example, why don't you just do a manual format once it prompts you? It would even be faster that way both from the generation as well as like the speed side. Also, large language models are trained on JSON, XML, CSV, etc. Tune does have a converter, but the amount of data that is already available that exists, it just makes this a hard decision.

### 📝 詳細説明

I like the idea though. What do you think?
