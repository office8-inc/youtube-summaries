## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

OpenAI released a new image model yesterday and today I thought we could just try it out and compare it to Nano Banana Pro. So, we're just going to do some parallel prompting and just see what the differences are. Do I prefer any of them, what are kind of the speed and stuff like that. So, it's not going to be like an indepth insane test. It's just going to be the things I use image models for.

### 📋 背景・概要

I want to test it out, compare it, and this could give you some indication of uh what model you could pick in different or similar yeah situations. So let's just uh get into it and do some comparison. So one thing I use Nanoana Pro for is uh to generate like uh images of workflows so it's easy to explain. So let's say we have like a workflow step one, step two, step three, step four, right? And we have some instructions.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And the prompt I use usually use is just create an image of this workflow. Easy to understand, black background, minimal text, 69 format. So I think we're just going to grab this uh all of this, I guess. And let's just head over to chatbt images and paste this in. So I guess we can just do something like this.

### 📝 詳細説明

And yeah, that looks good. And I also want to do this in AI Studio. So, I'm just going to paste it in. And I want to try to start them as similar as possible. Okay.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Run. And let's do the same here. And let's just take a look at how the speed is. And it says that the Shat PT model now is four times faster because that was very slow before. So, they must have put some more compute on this.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Um, so we're going to kind of compare. So, this is 20 seconds and this is I don't know if you have a timer here, but just uh give it some time and I'm going to kind of compare who's finished first here. So, while we wait for that, uh I want to talk a bit about my AI video course platform. If you want to dive deeper into AI video and start generating millions of views online, uh I have had some good success with this and setting up these autonomous pipelines and people seem to like it because they always come back to watch more. So uh yesterday I updated my platform.

### 🎯 応用例

So now I have a module on my AI video selfie autonomous workflow I did on the um YouTube channel a few days ago. So here I can go into more detail of how you can set this up. You will probably see a video in the background how this workflow works now. So this is a super cool workflow that has worked very well for me. And I've been a bit hesitant about sharing this but I I think it's time.

### 💭 考察

It doesn't matter too much. Uh I might have to put the price up a bit. So, if you want a nice holiday price, you can do this. Yeah. Over the next couple of weeks, I guess, and play around this during the holidays.

### 📌 まとめ

So, yeah, check it out. Link in the description. And let's go back to the video. Okay, so that was done. So, that was pretty quick.

### ✅ 結論

Okay, so I would say a chat GPD was a bit quicker here. Uh, I don't really like the results, though. First of all, it's not cropped correctly. It's kind of off screen, so that's not good. Uh, other than that, it's fine.

### 📚 追加情報

It just missed a bit on the cropping. Uh, yeah, and the arrow there is a bit strange. And yeah, it's not perfect, but it's okay, I guess. So, let's take a look at Yeah, this is this is what I like, right? So, this is something I like.

### 🔖 補足

This is much better. So, we have kind of the user image, the prompt, the model, the songs. Yeah, this is much better. So, I would definitely give this to Nano Valano Pro even though this is an improvement over the old model for sure. I thought we could do some iterations.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, we're going to upload a source image. Then, we have four different prompts we're going to use. So, yeah, I'm going to read them out after a while, but uh let's just look at the source image. I thought we can use this one, right? This is from said image turbo, by the way.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Great image. So, this is going to be our source image, and we're just going to do four iteration prompts to see how well we kind of preserve the character. So, I'm just going to copy the first one here and let's head back to chat GPT and stuff. And yeah, I guess we could just start here on Nana Banana. I'm just going to upload all the images and set this up.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, the prompt is move the person in the source image into a coffee shop with a laptop and a cup of coffee. In the background, there's a text on the wall. Click this button with a red button below it. Okay, so I'm going to start this in chatbt and I'm going to do the same here. Same prompt, remember?

### 🌟 セクション 16

and aspect ratio. I I guess I didn't say that. So, for this, I'm just going to pick 169. And let's see what we get here. We probably got to get like a square image, but I I guess that's fine.

### 🎬 セクション 17

I didn't specify that. So, yeah, let's just run this and let's compare the two results here. Yeah, this is not bad. Uh she's taking a sip of the copy. We can clearly see the text here.

### 📋 セクション 18

Looks good. And we have the button. Okay. Uh this is not bad. And this is a bit different take on this.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Uh, I would say I prefer this one because we kind of have the coffee shop in the background in this bouquet effect. This was a bit close. Uh, but uh, we're just going to keep with it. So now we're going to do some iterations. So the next is going to be she's standing next to the red button.

### 📝 セクション 20

She's looking at the button. So this is going to be very close though. But let's see what happens. So I'm just going to follow up with that. And here I'm just going to do the same.

### 💡 セクション 21

I hopefully it's going to be possible to iterate. here. She's standing next to a button. Okay, so let's see how that turns out. Okay, so this iteration I think I would give maybe to uh open AI here or G chat GPT image because she's following the instructions pretty good here.

### 🔧 セクション 22

She's looking at the image at the button and she is standing. But if you look at Nano Banana Pro, it's a bit different. It kind of took some she just turned around, but she is looking and ready to click. So, but she kind of kept Yeah, I I guess they both did did a pretty good job here to be honest. Uh I guess there was no room for standing here.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, I accept that. Uh but again, pretty good instruction following from both here. So, let's just do the next iteration and that is going to be a cinematic shot of the person actually pressing the button. High tension dramatic. So, let me set that up.

### 💭 セクション 24

Okay. So, if you look at chatd here, it kind of turned into this. Uh yeah, not bad. It kind of changed the coloring of the image a bit. And she is pressing.

### 📌 セクション 25

That's good. Yeah, this kind of changed. Uh, maybe this is more cinematic. And if you look at this, this looks a bit more dramatic because we kind of have the smoke. The the lighting is turned down.

### ✅ セクション 26

I think it's a bit more dark and she's definitely pressing. So, I would kind of give it to this one. It looks a bit more dramatic as I instructed. Uh, but this is fine. She shouldn't be smiling, at least when it's dramatic.

### 📚 セクション 27

But uh yeah, it's it's not bad. It's not bad. So, let's take a look at the final uh thing I wanted to do. So, here is kind of something different. So, be creative.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Create a next scene of what happens uh after the button is pressed. Shock the audience. Scene off, I guess. So, I'm going to copy this. So, this is more testing how creative, of course, it's going to be.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, I'm just going to pick what I prefer here. Uh again, this is subjective. There's no uh answer here, but uh yeah, I'm just going to run these two and pick the one I think uh was most interesting and kind of follow the instructions >> [music] >> uh most. Okay, so we have the results. So this is from chat GPT.

### 🚀 セクション 30

I think this was pretty good, right? Because you can see we are in some kind of control room. She's still pressing the button and there are some kind of yeah rockets or something here launching. So that's dramatic at least and it's kind of shocking. So I think this was a pretty good job.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Uh if you look at the Nana Banana, this was pretty cool, right? Because we she now took her laptop. She's in some kind of jungle and we can still kind of see she went through the coffee shop here in some kind of portal. That was also pretty good. So which one do I like the most here?

### 🌟 セクション 32

Uh I think I'm going to pick this one. I think this was pretty cool. Uh, but this was very creative and I like that we kind of still see this. Uh, but uh, yeah, I think I'm going to give this one to the chat GPT. I just like this more, but both were pretty good if you ask me.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, [music] next uh, I want to do some simple infographics just to see how that is. Create an infographics that explain how an LLM work. This should be Eli 5 like explain it like I'm five. Minecraft themed 69 format. So let's see how the new chhat GPD images does on infographics.

### 📋 セクション 34

Okay. So here chat GPT is very slow, right? I don't know. It's it's going now. But if you look at uh this has been done for like a minute now and it's just great, right?

### ⭐ セクション 35

We knew this. We know how good Nana Pro is at uh creating this infographics. So you can see gathering knowledge. All the text here looks good. Breaking it down, you can see we have this gathering knowledge.

### 📝 セクション 36

This is kind of this library with the Minecraft. And here is breaking it down into cubes. I like that. And we have this workbench. And here is the tokenization or the transformer.

### 💡 セクション 37

Uh we have this tokenization here, right? That's pretty cool. And here's how to build a house. First, gather wood. And yeah, I kind of like that.

### 🔧 セクション 38

That was pretty good. So, let's see. Uh chip now. All right. Not bad.

### 🎯 セクション 39

That looks pretty clear if you ask me. That's learning from text. A lot of patterns. Creepers are scary. We have some uh data here.

### 💭 セクション 40

Building knowledge facts. World knowledge base. [music] Creating responses. The creeper is word out. Very dangerous.

### 📌 セクション 41

Generating text. Okay. I think this did very good too. I think I kind of like the graphics of the chat GPT one a bit more maybe. So yeah, I think both did a good job here and pretty impressed by Chachet on this one.

### ✅ セクション 42

So I'm definitely going to try this out more and I don't see any issues with the the text here and yeah, very good. Not bad. Okay, so the last thing I wanted to do is just a simple background remover because this is something I use and here I think I have been using both but uh previously Shachi PT was pretty good at this. So, I'm just going to run uh remove the background of this image and do the same here. So, I remember the last strategy image model was very good at background removal or background image uh removing backgrounds from images.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, let's see if it can still keep that up. So, yeah, I'm just Damn, that was fast. Okay, so let's look at the Google results. So, the speed is definitely still on Google site, I think. Site, I think.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Uh, okay. Not too bad. Let's just uh open this a bit bigger here. Let's remove that. Uh, all right.

### 🎨 セクション 45

This is fine. It's a bit maybe a bit blurry, but let's check out that GPT one. Uh, it's fine. Uh, okay. So, this is a bit slower.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So, I'm just going to take you back when this is done. Okay, that was fast. Yeah, this is better, I think. So you can see it actually does remove it. It doesn't just put this uh yeah on.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So you can see this is a transparent image and yeah that looks very good. So I would definitely give this to CHP as expected I think. So, so yeah, that was basically what I wanted to try out today. And my conclusion is that definitely improvements on the CHP image one and uh yeah, the speed is a nice improvement and I think they good did a pretty good job, but it's a bit early. I'm going to keep trying it out and just include it in my workflows just to see how well it works.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Uh but so far, I think it's pretty good, but I'm not quite sure if it's going to work with these complex things with the graphs and stuff. That's going to be another time. But yeah, so far pretty impressed. Not bad. So, go check it out.

### 🎬 セクション 49

I think you I think it's everyone can use this. I think so. Uh but yeah, maybe this gave you something inspiration, something you want to try out. I hope so. And yeah, thank you for tuning in and I'll see you again
