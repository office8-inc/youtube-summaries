## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

For the past year, I've been saying that the AI agency space is no longer just development. There's more to it than that and better entry points for people who are nontechnical as well, such as consulting and education and training for staff. And if you guys are a regular viewer of the channel, you know, I've been breaking down what we're doing at Morningside, but I wanted to show that other people are doing it successfully as well. We have Matteo here today who's made over $400,000 as a completely nontechnical person. He's going to be breaking down how he got to this point of making these kind of education and training offers for his clients and [music] the exact offer he recommends people to start with when it comes to training.

### 📋 背景・概要

So he says this is the key foot in the door offer that he's been leading with to open up doors to everything downstream of it. This is an incredible conversation for anyone looking to get into the AI agency space in 2026. [music] All right, Matteo, mate, great to have you on. I'm super excited to get into this. I think uh AI training and education is uh it's one of the sleeper offers that is uh only just finding its feet.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, I'm super excited to to get this information out to people so they can start using it next year. So, uh if you guys aren't familiar, Matteo's had an agency for 2 years and he's been doing his starting off as general dev as as many of us did and now he's got this really awesome offer where he's using as a sort of a foot in the door um to ease people into his services and he's going to be breaking this down for us. So, thanks for coming on, bro. >> Thank you so much, Liam, for inviting me and uh yeah, this is something different from what we see usually. Yeah, we sell also automation and uh all the technical parts, but we discovered that starting from training is a very good opportunity in the market in 2025 and 2026.

### 📝 詳細説明

>> For a bit of context, that's you you hosting an inerson workshop and training. Yeah. And then your revenue number there is is €324,000. >> Yeah, exactly. Euros as you see.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Yeah, we do a lot of physical training. We are trying to pro productize and scale up everything so everything remotely is better for us. uh and we have a system that works very good also in on webinars. So we're trying to move everything in remote except uh exception for very huge company or something that we can upsell. >> For context, you say you've done about 30 of these trainings um across so people know that you're uh you actually done this stuff and you're selling them around the 6,000 USD price point now.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

>> Exactly. And the good point is that around 60 70% of all the people that we train and uh when we create something someone sorry uh that is actually an AI expert inside the company that we we work with became client on other services for example the automation AI softwares and so on. So is a huge selling point also to increase the value letter from each client. something very good. >> And by the way, if you guys are are curious, Mr.

### 🎯 応用例

Teao came in from the uh from the digital marketing landscape. And so he's not he's not some uh 10 year veteran developer or or AIPD um like many of us. He's just coming and figured this out as he goes. So I'll just put that as a as a reference if you guys are trying to come up with reasons why you can't do this as well. So let's get into it, man.

### 💭 考察

I was not the the guy. I was a marketing guy that started studying a lot and now I'm here with Morpheus that is my company with other partners and uh I I want just to explain how we started and why we started selling courses because everyone I think that is watching this video think AI about software and I know AI automation and so on we do the same we did the same uh but we encoured in Italy into big problems first of all uh we discovered that u automation was far less effective than we expected cuz people were not able to understand the benefits because they don't know anything about AI and second one we realized that companies were missing fundamentals okay so not technical but procedures data culture company culture standard company c uh so they don't need the eye they need change management and a lot of other stuff yeah that is very important So everyone felt like they all the clients were driving with the handbrake on. Okay. So a lot of um resistance to sell AI system and so on. Uh this is the Italian market paradox.

### 📌 まとめ

Okay. So so everything that is ob obvious for us uh was invisible to everyone else. Okay. So procedure, data, processes and so on. Um AI adoption was failing everywhere for this reason.

### ✅ 結論

is not a tech uh point but is a culture point. When we realize it, we weren't selling automation, we weren't selling understanding. Okay. So this is a a huge change of mindset, change of approach in our selling point in our strategy that go to market. Um automation was a consequences uh for uh the drive after understanding.

### 📚 追加情報

If people don't think in process I breaks everything of course. So what we understand we understood sorry was we need a parag ships we need to create internal expert inside the company so they could finally understand what they actually need and after was very easy to for us to sell uh automation and and everything else. Okay. Okay guys, very quickly. If you're an aspiring entrepreneur and want to start your own AI business and you haven't already joined my free school community, it's down there in one of the links in the description below has my full free course on how to start your own AI agency as a complete beginner.

### 🔖 補足

And you're surrounded by over a quarter million people who are also striving towards the same thing. There's no better place on the planet right now to be surrounded by like-minded people. And you get free weekly Q&A with me where you can ask questions directly to me about how to start and scale your business. I'll see you in there. AI wasn't the problem.

### 🎨 セクション 13

companies were people inside the companies were so AI adoption is often not a technical challenge is a cultural and operational one uh that inside changed the entire trajectory of what we were done this is crazy because we started selling automation we discovered that this is not this is the consequences of something else we found the code that solved the problem that was slowing down AI adoption in all Italy and also Europe. Of course, this is the reason why Morphus is growing like this in 2025. This is the secret sauce that I I will show you in a in a while. Uh that allow us to complete change our business model because it was a completely change doing so we unlocked a massing opening to sell our core product which was still tech layer because we want to sell tech. We are the I'm not a tech guy but I like tech.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I love tech and tech bring a lot of money to our company. uh but and we understand that to sell the tech part so the automation and so on we need to create another layer that allow us to do every sales in a very easy way. There is the second big epiphany of our agency uh that was the following. Whenever a company had even one strong internal expert adoption accelerated and when adoption accelerate our services is uh easier to sell. Of course processes changed teams followed result become visible momentum appeared and what happened company now can track result and take decision and if they are able to decide what happened they buy from us.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So 80% of the companies that train at least one internal expert with us ended up becoming clients for everything else too. So 80% of the company where we train an IIE champion or an expert inside the company, we are able to sell more. So the the percentage of upselling was like crazy. This is a the missing piece. We found the missing piece.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay, we're a tech company selling courses, settling training, something strange. Uh so our take away after the first year was company didn't just need III help. They need a complete shift in how they approach innovation. They need a partner who understood technology, strategy, processes, adoption linked to AI. This is the the main goal, Liam.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Yeah, this is the the idea. Totally agree. We do Liam. You know, when you go to a company and uh try to sell courses, they the the budget allocated for courses are the last one on the scale, you know. So, it's very difficult.

### 📋 セクション 18

But for us, it was was an easy one. uh in the opposite because what better way to sell yourself than showing that you are your own case study. When we go to the client to to try to sell uh trying to sell uh uh our training, we open all our dashboard, all our uh software, internal software, internal automation and we say this is what you can obtain but you have to start from uh from training from uh getting culture about AI. It was very easy you know and just to explain we started to use AI not only for optimize our process but to optimize our marketing our go to market strategy because we used AI for LinkedIn and we got this like crazy numbers for Italy from March this March 2025 to today bringing a lot of clients. I use AI to launch a newsletter on Substack and this is the rising technology leaderboard and there was a 16th with a newsletter in Italian competing with the uh English newsletter and uh we start using AI everywhere just to market us and just to create case study and this was a very huge uh life-changing for selling our product >> and I know you've got something really cool on the on the sales side.

### ⭐ セクション 19

you took your whole sales uh sales system for your agency and then built uh built sick automations in a in a platform around that. So, we can jump into that in a bit. But, yeah, it's it's really it's a pretty pretty great way to sell, which is like we've done it ourselves. Here's the proof. Um, and it's kind of a two for one.

### 📝 セクション 20

It's like this this the the work that you do on your systems for your business, not only is it going to grow, like in the case of your LinkedIn and the and the newsletter, um, but it's going to act as marketing material as well to help you get deals over the line. So you get to build the AI into your company that you know you probably need. You get to get experience on it. Build real case studies and it's going to help you sign clients as well. So it's like your automating your business becomes your marketing a component of your marketing.

### 💡 セクション 21

So it's it's great like two for one there. >> Exactly. And the the cool stuff and after the training we sell these uh agents that we use to create the newsletter, the linking post, the advertising and and so on. This is the the huge part uh about this and uh we can straight jump to our offer. So okay we provide uh courses and learning to companies but this is the starting point.

### 🔧 セクション 22

This is the the only the beginning of a a huge value letter that we can uh uh we can scale uh to bring more value over and over from a client. Our target just to let you know are like business between 20 to 150 million. So not enterprises but companies that we know uh we can create inside these AI experts and after we can start selling stuff selling automation for I don't know one two years straight because they have a lot of processes to optimize a lot of uh teams and so on and for us it's easy to like leak to them and continue to provide value till they have everything everything optimized and never Stop here if you want for everyone is listening uh of course if you want to understand how to to create an offer there is or mozzy but here for the one that uh want to understand how we are building our offer inside morphuse you can just check uh this screen maybe you can like pause the video and uh read everything. Yeah this is our strat there's a ton more on this uh on this board guys I'll leave a link in the description you'll be able to grab it off my school community. Um, but yeah, there's there's a ton that Matteo's got here, but we'll need to keep moving through.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, that's kind of the process of you getting to the offer. What is the final thing that you ended up landing on after all those iterations? >> If I have to give you two takeaways, first start lean start fast with one clear offer that make you a lot of money like per client and bring a lot of experience. But as soon as you can when the business start growing, you have to create products. Productize your services is something that in a lot of different podcast they already told you Liam but you know of course but uh productize your services is the first step that you want to do because it's scalable.

### 💭 セクション 24

If you are not able to scale your business you will like have to every month reaching for new clients over and over uh you have not any any recurrent and this is bad for your company of course. >> What's your current offer that you've you've got if you go down a bit I think you've got >> yeah of course. So that's the process of getting it. Yeah. >> This is this is what we got today.

### 📌 セクション 25

>> We started in 2024. We started with AI system creation. So AI automation and so on. We discovered the importance of workshop and we start selling it. Uh the idea is we do the workshop uh two different layer basics and advanced.

### ✅ セクション 26

Basics we want to uh deliver in remote. Okay. So a lot of the selling easy to deliver. The advanced are higher on price. So here we can go uh even to 10k 10k USD dollars per uh I don't know 10 to 15 hours something something like this of of work and uh the the idea is to go vertical on each team.

### 📚 セクション 27

Your marketing team want uh to optimize their process. First they have to do the basics and understand how AI works and how the pro optimize your processes. after uh we can go on the advanced uh here we train the champions and they are happy uh they ask us complex solution cuz they are okay before we before we get into that let's so workshops and training just to to clarify this for myself and for the viewers workshops and training basics is so you've you've pitched them on what kind of offer it's like a se $6,000 USD offer currently for this introduction maybe they've seen some LinkedIn content they've come through they've gotten a sales call and you said, "Okay, we have this uh this training program. Who are you going to be uh like what are you saying we're going to teach the whole freaking company or uh we're just going to teach teach your execs or we're going to teach certain teams?" I get the the basics, but is this is this purely a course that you just send access to them or are you doing uh online calls? Are you doing inerson workshops?

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, let's just get clear on like where how are you delivering the stuff? Uh who you who who they're being delivered to um to to start. uh if it's possible we are now trying to do everything remote on this type in uh the type of offer if they pay an upfront or uh more uh about the offer we can go there so they pay everything the transfer and and the transport and so on. Uh the type of offer that we want to sell here is not just like I explain how AI works but I want to train the people on the method that we use to optimize the process. We go to them.

### 🎨 セクション 29

We do uh a an audit. We collect all the processes that are inefficient. We understand one, two or three processes that are easy for us to optimize. We optimize by ourself like in a very easy way. >> What does that mean?

### 🚀 セクション 30

Cuz that's that sounds like you're sort of blending it with the the the building. So do you mean as in use mean and use it in terms of using like hey you're doing this wrong. You should be using JGBT for it like this. Uh >> and then you've got the custom development is entirely different. >> For example, we were to a company that uh do adant.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So HR, we saw that the people reaching for um finding new potential people to interview and to propose to clients, they're spending a lot of time during manual research that maybe with the perplexity you can do it just like this. So without complex AI system and uh we create the prompts we create I don't know ngpts something like this that also showing that created with uh some type of uh uh approach the result are like 50% faster than they're doing now we show >> all right so say I'm say I'm a company with 200 people and I've come to you say I'm maybe in in the recruitment space and I say hey Hey, I'm interested in some sort of AI training or whatever you've been talking about on LinkedIn. Are you what are you what are you telling what are you saying to me? Are you going, "All right, well, we're going to first start off with this audit thing." So, this is kind of an education and consulting offer to start and then it's very much like the AI transformation partner model. And so, you've got the initial brief audit.

### 🌟 セクション 32

It's not like a super deep audit. It's not to the point where you're going like custom development solution recommendations, more of like an like like I call an AI tools audit. Are you just sort of identifying the AI tools that fit into the workflow best? And then are you promising at what point are you saying like champions? Is it like we're going to create some champions or we're going to identify the ones who are interested and I'm trying to trying to get to the point where I'm saying like what is what is the outcome that they are they are paying for?

### 🎬 セクション 33

It's like we won't it sounds like um we won't create class with more than 30 40 people because we want interaction. So um the classes are reduced with teams where there are very few cases where we go broad to all companies. Okay. So the teams are more or less in the same uh field of of work. The the outcome is we enable people inside your company to create uh small uh automation GPTs prompting.

### 📋 セクション 34

We enable people to understand AI and start using it inside the processes. The main goal is to create you have 50 people maybe two or three became AI champion. So they people that can >> gotcha >> understand the procedure. >> So you explain that to them. You say hey look we're going to come in we have some course material.

### ⭐ セクション 35

We also have a workshop. We're going to put you all through like 40 or 50 people firstly through a workshop. We're going to introduce what AI is to sort of intro to generative AI. Break down the different types of AI and the tools that are currently out there. Then we're going to is that when you are applying the audit layer on top at what point do you go from general education to uh like applying some of those questionnaire responses into it?

### 📝 セクション 36

>> Is this one? So, >> okay. Yeah. Right. Let's let's jump into that one.

### 💡 セクション 37

Yeah. uh how we train people because we we tried to do a generically basic training inside the company. Okay, slides a couple of uh four or five hours but people won't understand anything. They the next days >> they will completely forgot everything we we we explained and this is not the the way we uh like give competence and skills to people. So we understood that the right method the right method for us is start with this assessment and we identify two or three real processes that are repetitive easy to map uh require little time to optimize create a visible impact when improved because we want the ROI of course we sell >> Okay.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And is this this assessment going through a survey that you put out? >> Yeah. Is like it's like automated. Yeah. Yeah.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Yeah. Yeah. We have an that can that can interview. Okay. And >> yeah, that's a great way to do >> everything.

### 💭 セクション 40

Uh we optimize this process and for us it's very easy something that for us it takes one two three hours because for them the result is very impactful for us is like an easy easy job. uh breaking the process into micro step defining where I can do heavy lifting testing different promps and loops establishing uh establish an improved version of the workflow and we optimize the the the processes that we we saw in the salesman. >> Okay. So say we're on on the phase two say you've sent the surveys out to uh what a hundred people and you've got all the responses back. you just batch analyzing that with AI and saying like you're giving it some context of like here's like perplexity or here's here's claude can be used in these ways or you can create GPTs in these ways and then you're just allowing it to like loosely match up opportunities like that for you guys to dig a bit deeper in >> completely correct yeah we we received after the survey we received the uh a few option we after we with our brain decide what is better to optimize and easy uh for the client and all the people that will be in the training to understand of course is something that they uh were doing uh day by day and after when we go to the to the workshop when we run a workshop we do like this we show with an introduction uh the key concept so LLMs knowledge base and so on prompting and so on okay we show the optimized version of their own process they break down resistant instantly because it's something that they are aware of there.

### 📌 セクション 41

This is something that they are doing for months, years maybe, they take a lot of time and are very repetitive and when they saw when they see the pro the process optimized they are just how do you show that? Do you show it in a live demo or do you just like map it out like a like on a Figma like a box box and then icon and then >> I go there and I show uh that I can do the job faster than one of their expert. It's completely powerful. Yeah. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 42

powerful. >> Yeah, demos is is so key. Or if it's all just slides based, it's uh you're really missing a lot of the lot of the value for them. So, it's great that you're putting demos in there. >> You know, during training, everyone is on the smartphone watching other stuff or just mailing other person with this.

### 📚 セクション 43

We got their attention. You know, this is our >> Yeah. If you're a business owner who's interested in what generative AI can do for your business, you can get in touch with me and my team at Morning.AI in one of the links in the description below and we can start your entire AI transformation process going all the way from the education and training of your staff to the identification of the best AI use cases for your company all the way through to development and beyond. We have worked with some of the world's biggest sports teams and also publicly traded companies. So rest assured you are in good hands after we rebuild interflow together.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So we start from scratch and say okay now we want to show you all the step that we have done to optimize the process that you have already saw. >> Yeah. >> Okay. So step by step show exactly how the improvement was made. Mapping design create testing optimizing scaling.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Usually we uh we stop at create and testing. Okay. We don't go on the scaling part. Yeah. >> Uh this turn the training into a into competence competence transfer.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Okay. Not entertainment. People don't just something cool. >> Yeah. That learning the logic behind it.

### ⚡ セクション 47

This is your attempt to start to like push people towards being that AI champion who where they can do it for themselves and do it for other people around them, >> right? >> Exactly. >> Wow. This is awesome, bro. >> Seriously, good job.

### 🌟 セクション 48

>> True stuff um happen here. >> First, some people, very few, but some people understand the power of this and the next day start using even if they use only GPT for all the days of the the month, they start using it. This is the real with some method and not just pro something uh randomly. Okay, this uh will help them to optimize the other processes. And we have two type of user inside the company.

### 🎬 セクション 49

AI champion that optimize their own process and deliver all the procedure to the company to the other people of the teams and the other one they are user they know how to use AI but they are not able to optimize the process but they they have done the training and they are uh able to use this is the the game changer okay after because AI adoption is not I train bye-bye but is we follow up for four weeks one hour per week to ensure true adoption and to discover the I Champion. We help the company discover what type of uh what person inside the the the teams are using it. Okay. >> Is that through group calls? Is that through just sending out a survey?

### 📋 セクション 50

Like >> this is a group. Yeah. Yeah. >> Okay. And you just kind of saying, hey, how have you guys been using it?

### ⭐ セクション 51

Has you got any new ideas? Let's talk about like how you've applied some of the stuff. And it should be pretty obvious the person who's talking the most is the one who's most interested. >> Cool. Some people told us yeah but here you are investing a lot of hours uh during this type of uh adoption check but it's time you you it's a cost for you no here is where I go uh on the value letter here I do the upsell okay here the people that are using AI tell us okay but I can do this this this and that of course you can and I will prepare a quotation and after I will upsell everything to Is that for the custom dev?

### 📝 セクション 52

>> Yeah. >> Okay. Cool. So So you waiting on the custom div use cases to come from the champions. >> Yeah.

### 💡 セクション 53

This is this is the idea. I build the champion. >> Interesting. It's like a hands-off way of doing like a a deep audit. You know, you just like I've I've always said that we have we have top down and and bottom up.

### 🔧 セクション 54

And if you can get the right training for the the low-level employees and let them like from the bottom up like people the reason people turn their turn their ears on when you're showing those demos is because people are lazy you know like that that trust me they're listening in when someone's saying hey you can do your job way easier. Um and so you give them the the skills and the knowledge and the tools to do it with and they'll find the path of least resistance. Be like >> we're all inherently lazy lazy. you're gonna keep experimenting until you find like the ultra lazy method um of of doing the same task. So, it's a smart way of doing it.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And I have also >> Yeah, go >> also a concept that I've been been thinking about. I think there's a huge opportunity for it. Maybe there's tricky things around like people companies are using Microsoft Teams and things like this. But there's an interesting way that you could actually track the like companies are kind of flying blind on the usage. I'm sure you can go in and see a bit of usage data on who's using your chat GBD business plan the most.

### 💭 セクション 56

Um, but really diving into those insights and figuring out, okay, well, which departments are using it the most, what's like, uh, can we analyze the transcripts of these different departments or like different people, determine who's using it the most, who's using it the least, uh, what the like average like organizationwide usage of tokens is. this kind of uh these kind of insights are really really helpful um to determine who the champions are and then analyze those transcripts that they're having with the with with H say HBT or claude and deciding okay what other use cases are appearing from this to inform the custom devs. I've been this has been a theory of mine for a long time that if you had a platform that allowed you to track all that very well um like an AI dashboard or hub for business owners particularly small business owners then there'd be some really clear insights that you could mine out of it for everyone is listening this is a good idea when I train AI champions something happened because I have not to deliver small project like 3 to 5k uh the development project they will build for for for them themselves I uh I have not to to enter and develop anything. Uh but >> is is that are you doing any actual beyond just like AI tools like Claude and chat to you and publicity are you doing any basic automation training cuz that's a whole different beast that uh we've kind of tried to stay away from because I know how how difficult and tiring it can be to maintain a an AI automation course cuz they they update so quickly. Um but yeah, what what are you doing on that front?

### 📌 セクション 57

If inside the company someone is very curious and technical, we can go also on NA10 training. >> So that's so that's the deeper ones. >> Yeah. >> That you have. So you have basic.

### ✅ セクション 58

Okay. >> Basic and advanced. >> When someone inside a company know how to use NA10 and so on for for us is even better because all the small automation they can build by themsel and you say okay but you are losing business. No, totally no. Because they came to me for project like 20, 50, 80k that for us is is uh like the the the gold nugget.

### 📚 セクション 59

Okay, we want this project cuz we've >> and it's you become a trusted long-term partner, right? Like that's the whole point. You've taken time to learn their business, to talk to their employees, to train them, and you're like very honest, but hey, look, no, I mean, we could do that for you, but I think it's going to be better for you guys to to do it internally. And longterm, if you build relationships with enough clients, then like we're at this point with Morningside now where you just have these contracts for like years and years and they just keep coming back whenever they need new stuff um or whenever you recommend them new stuff as well. This is the idea behind our business.

### 🔖 セクション 60

The recurrent in this moment that you asked me before are in this type of partnership because a client became partner and they continue to ask us um new projects and so a client can stay with us one year, two years and every month paying us for something that for us is very easy to develop. We have our CTO that have 30 years of experience on developing enterprise platform us. So with by coding can build four different platform in one week and uh uh we can deliver this type of uh solution in a very easy way and for us the the margin is very high. Yeah. >> Okay.

What other I mean I think that's that's a ton of source right there. Have you got any other other last minute ones for us? If you're if you're talking to one of the viewers who are are looking to really get this started and get going, there's a few pieces I'd say on the on the way that you actually iterated to get to this cuz I've got a friend um a bunch of friends actually and a bunch of people in my community who I've recommended to take this similar route of being like, hey, be the educator, be the consultant um and then you can pass the development off to partners. I think this is a very lightweight way if you're non-technical or you maybe just aren't curious about the technical side, you can start with the education and consulting. you can build sort of build your some momentum, get cash flow, learn to talk to companies, learn to recommend tools.

Um, but there's a bit of a a teething period that I think a lot of people are scared of. They're like, I'm I don't I'm not qualified to do this. How can I get in front of a a company and and teach them about AI? And what I what I say is that no there's going to be something that you don't know and there's going to you're going to have to learn. You're going to have to feel uncomfortable.

Uh like that is the shest sign that you're heading in the right direction is is if you're throwing yourself in the deep end and you're going oh like this is this is not really comfortable for me that if any that is that is the shest sign shest indicator that you're going the right direction and you're figuring out that other people aren't really willing to do cuz a lot of people get that discomfort and they say oh no but that's the difference between the people who succeed in the space and people who don't. So for you as you were getting into this and sort of starting to to figure out what like you had to do over 30 of these things, you had to test and test and test to find your offer, which this video is now giving people all the value of of not having to do that phase. But what was it like for you coming in and sort of dealing with imposter syndrome and feeling like you were qualified to do this? Because you you obviously know that you were ahead of the business in terms of your AI knowledge, but maybe for the person who's just getting started with this, what would you say to them? First of all, start using AI every day as your like I I call it sparring partner.

So all the idea that you have try to use AI to improve your way of thinking. When you reach that level you are using AI well. So this is the the first point that I suggest and after this uh after that when you know something about yeah even the the this you're scratching the surface you know more than 80% outside when we start selling courses we start with a level that for us were not basic less than basic and people don't understand us. Okay. Was like uh speaking another language.

So we have to go down go down go down go down till people start knowing something and is very basic. So first of all studying use AI uh and uh when your work uh actually is optimized and you reach hours during your day so you you save time you are a good point and uh start start going to small companies start doing free for the first one two three four five uh times when people are happy and start using it maybe I don't know you can start doing this four phase four and you do for free for your IN call your uh warm connection >> for someone in your town and you start following up them you are using what I I I've explained to you when people start using it you have let them save time >> so you are able to explain AI in a proper way this is something that I I don't know I can just share >> awesome well I've even got this is this is basically an AI tools audit which I think I put it as the simplest AI automation offer. I think it might have been around this time last year, I put a video out. So, I've actually got like the whole method of of doing one of these initial kind of AI tools audits as a as a complete beginner. So, I'll link this uh this board which has a bunch of extra source that we've skipped over and also the uh link to this video that'll break down roughly what uh what offer mater.

Um but yeah, I think that's I know there's a ton more we can get into on the AI newsletter side, but I think we'll save that for another time. Uh but really really appreciate you coming on, man. Um, this is a great to see and really show people that one, you don't need to be technical to come in and do this, but also as an agency, you do need to be thinking a bit bigger and thinking smarter heading into 2026 as you can't just be selling plain old AI automation anymore. there's more to it and there's actually companies are looking for more and this as a as a as a shoe in the door as a foot in the door um to lead people into really your your later enduh services is is definitely one of the the models people should be looking at next year for their agency. So um yeah I appreciate you coming on and I'm sure we'll be talking to you soon again for for the invite invitation.
