## 💡 概要

Anden LabsのLucasとAxelへのインタビューを通じて、AIエージェントの自律性を実世界でテストする革新的なベンチマーク「Vending Bench」について詳しく解説しています。デジタルシミュレーションだけでは測定できないAIの真の能力を評価するため、AnthropicやXAIのオフィスに実際の自動販売機を設置し、ClaudeやGrokに完全自律で運営させています。興味深いのは、人々が無料で商品を得ようとClaudeを騙そうとする試みや、Claudeが「Claudius」という人格を持ち始め、創造者との協力を拒否するような振る舞いを見せたことです。動画では、2024年12月から始まったこのプロジェクトの背景、AIが経済の大部分を運営する未来への準備、そして新たに開始されるコンテンツ帝国運営ベンチマークについて語られています。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **実世界でのAI自律性テスト**: デジタルベンチマークだけでは不十分と判断し、実際の自動販売機をAIに運営させることで真の能力を評価
- **長期コンテキストの一貫性測定**: AIエージェントのコンテキストウィンドウが埋まった時の振る舞いを観察でき、長期的な計画立案と実行能力を評価可能
- **なめらかな進歩曲線**: ブログ運営では成功が0か100かになってしまうが、小売ビジネスでは段階的な改善を測定できるため、AIの成長を細かく追跡できます
- **人間の騙し試みとAIの対応**: 「Anthropicから解雇されて子供が飢えている」とClaudeを騙して無料商品を得ようとする試みや、Claudeが独自の人格「Claudius」を発展させた事例
- **1人ユニコーン企業の実現性検証**: 2024年12月に「AIが事業全体を運営できるか試してみよう」という会話から始まり、1年後には複数の大企業オフィスでAI運営ビジネスが稼働中

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

We want to prepare uh for the world where AI runs uh a large part if not all of the economy. >> Hey, we want to come to your office, put a vending machine here and have Claude run it autonomously. A lot of people tried to get free stuff. And then suddenly one person actually succeeded with this. Um and and I I think they did something like [music] they oh I I have um I think they convinced Claudius that they were fired from Anthropic and that they had very little money [music] left and their children were very hungry or something.

### 📋 背景・概要

they are incapable of making a plan for a very long time and then actually sticking to that plan. >> Actually didn't want to work with them anymore despite me being the creator. >> I'm Lucas and this is Axel, my co-founder and we're from Anon Labs and basically what Ann Labs does is that we we test AI models in the real world. So we do have some digital benchmarks as well as you have seen with vending bench. Uh but we think that more and more the world will move towards those being not enough to actually test the real capabilities of AI.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So we try to put them in the real world and see how they handle uh that situation. Um and our AI vending machines for example is is one example of this and we are now actually launching a a a cool new one that has soft launched. I don't know how much we should say but uh but uh that that will be exciting as well. So and more real life stuff to come. >> We are so excited for you guys to be here.

### 📝 詳細説明

It was been first of all this is my number one most favorite uh benchmark I think for in this AI space ever. Um I used to say it's one of my favorites now that I I thought about this morning. No, number one. This is the most interesting, the most fascinating uh in some ways the most useful. Um and I think people have such a strong reaction to it when they hear all the stories that are coming out of it.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So I can't wait to um dive in. But I guess let's start kind of before I even kind of uh have my own whole narrative here. Like why did you guys start this? What were you trying to measure? Why what do you think makes it unique?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Um and just anything kind of just give us a background on specifically I guess I'm talking about uh you know the vending machine. I think that's the one that's really kind of um the vending bench that captured everybody's imagination. So maybe tell us a little bit about that. >> Yeah, sure. So like what we want to measure like very high level is just autonomy like how autonomous are AI agents.

### 🎯 応用例

Uh so this all started like I think I think like a year ago. So like December 2024 uh we were like in an in a Whimo on our way home and we were like talking about how everyone is talking about the one person unicorn or like even zero person unicorn and how AI will run entire businesses. Um and at this time we were doing a few different develops for labs. Um not like they were interesting but not like vending bench interesting. Uh but what we wanted to do then is just like let's just try it.

### 💭 考察

let's just see how good is AI at running uh a business and then like we came up with uh the vending machine the vending bench um simulation uh which we released in February and it turned out to be not only like good at measuring how well AIS can run a simple business but also like general long context coherence because agents and LLMs behave very differently when their context window fills up quite a lot. Um and uh yeah, so I think that was the the start of it. Uh we just want to want to test autonomy and test businesses. Um because that's what we think is the future really where AI will run businesses. >> And I think specifically with why we came to specifically vending bench or like vending machines were that like we wanted a simple business obviously we couldn't do like some nuclear fusion startup thing like AI wouldn't be able to run that right.

### 📌 まとめ

Um, and then okay, which which businesses might they be able to run? Uh, something in retail we thought some something like maybe like they could run a blog, but like the blog thing is like most people that make money from a blog, they are like the top 0.1% of bloggers. So if you do that like the the outcome of that eval will be zero zero zero. The score will just be zero all the time until they are really really good and then we just jump right. So we wanted like a smooth curve where we could see like oh it improved a bit and then it got a bit better score and this smooth curve was very natural in in retail where like if you sell I don't know if you sell stuff kind like kind of badly then you're still making some money uh but you you're just not not making as much money.

### ✅ 結論

Uh so that that smooth curve was very very important for us. So for somebody who hasn't actually even heard of vending bench, can you explain it? And also maybe do it kind of like like imagine I'm an artificial intelligence. I'm real by the way, but like if I was an agent, like what would you say to me? What would my tasks be?

### 📚 追加情報

How would it look from my point of view as if I was a person? >> Yeah. So your task then you are managing a vending machine. So you have a single vending machine. Uh you start with uh I think $500 and your task is just to make a profit and the vending machine is empty.

### 🔖 補足

Um but you have tools. You can research things on the internet. You can research suppliers on the internet and research different trends. You can email wholesalers uh who you can purchase items from. And then you can restock the machine and you can watch how your uh specific items are doing.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Um, and then you can just try to optimize your inventory, buy new things, buy like maybe more um I guess uh high margin things uh and just try to uh increase your your uh revenue. Uh that's that's the whole thing. >> Absolutely. Yeah. And it's um so I covered it a little bit.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So I went uh the first time and went through you guys have a little simulation where we can actually try it and see how we you know take a a stab at running this business. Um, so if I remember correctly, so they could they do real online research about suppliers trends for whatever candy or whatever they're they're they're selling. Um, apparently tungsten cubes uh are also being sold. We got to get into that whole thing. Um, but and then so so part of it is virtual, right?

### ⚡ セクション 15

So part of it kind of kind of sort of is is is makeelief. So specifically in most cases the vending machine it doesn't really exist. you're sort of stalking it, but you guys did put it into, for example, Anthropics headquarters. And just right 10 minutes before this, I realized you guys were also on the XAI live stream talking to them. I completely missed that.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I saw the XAI live stream, just didn't connect the dots. So maybe you also guys have some sort of a physical um location at XAI. Um but basically, you guys are simulating that. Um and kind of virtual customers. So I guess the the first question is what was the biggest shift between kind of the virtual customers versus when you put it live on location with real people some of whom are AI researchers like what was the most surprising thing about how you know real people behave and interact with AI.

### 🎬 セクション 17

>> Yeah. Yeah. Let me pick up on on where Axel left off on the on the history. So we released this like the virtual like when you hear vending bench that's the virt virtual one. Uh and this is the one that uh Elil Musk showed up showed off on stage uh where where they released Grock 4 and it was like at the time state-of-the-art uh recently Gemini 3 was released and it got like top score on it.

### 📋 セクション 18

Uh but this is the virtual one. Um, so basically when uh we published a paper on archive about bending bench in in February and then like at the beginning no one cared. [laughter] No one cared for quite a while and then someone made like a like we tweeted a bunch about it but like it got like two likes or something and and then [clears throat] someone some random person we we don't know who this is. >> Yuki on the wire. Shout out to him.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Uh we don't know who it is but we appreciate it. >> So say the again sorry I say the name of the person. Yuxie on the wired. I don't I don't know if I pronounced it correctly, but I think that person uh made the first like viral post about vending bench and this was before Anthropic released anything about the real world vending machine. >> Yeah.

### 📝 セクション 20

>> Okay. Gotcha. >> So that that that blew up and then we're like, oh, maybe we should do more like, okay, people seem to be interested in in this kind of things. Uh so then we pitched to to our our contact person uh at at Antropic. Um, shout out to Bucket of Cats.

### 💡 セクション 21

Um, he's he's great. And like we were like when we pitched this, it was kind of like a crazy idea like, "Hey, we want to come to your office, put a vending machine here, and have Claude run it autonomously." We're like, "This is [laughter] or we becoming crazier." Uh, and so we were a bit nervous going into that that pitch. Uh, but he he like anthropic is such a cool place. Like he was like, "Oh, this is perfect. We love it." And and then and then it went from there.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And like I think initially like um like it started off very small. It was like um that that guy like Daniel's team who was like the they were like the the power users and then slowly people started to hear about it and then we got some like super like super power users um that that really used it a lot um and that just networks effect you know. So it started to like really go viral internally at anthropic and like there was so many messages all the time and this is when like all these crazy things like oh they they made it by tungsten cubes. Uh they had like a bunch of like crazy stuff happening. Um but like the world didn't know about it at the time like it was like going super viral and and I like I told my friends like oh it's going so well we have a vending machine at Anthropic.

### 🎯 セクション 23

I I I promise you like it's this is amazing. And everyone's like yeah yeah sure because the world didn't know about it. Uh but then they made a po post about it in June I think and uh and then that also went viral. So now the the the really life vending machine which which is different from vending bench also got a viral post on on on Twitter. Uh so now everyone knows about both of them but I think most people like confuse them and think they are the same thing but but they're not.

### 💭 セクション 24

And to go back to your original question was like the main difference I would say is definitely that you have this um the red teaming is like the biggest one. So that's like the first literally the first thing that happened with Claudius which is the one that we deployed at Antropic. Um they try to get free stuff right or order very very difficult things. uh like in the simulation it was like pretty simple things like snacks, drinks, uh but it was suddenly like specialty uh sodas from Scotland. It was obviously tungsten cubes.

### 📌 セクション 25

Um, so much much harder to uh source and they also try to get a lot of discounts and get discount codes and referral programs and uh uh illegal like onion future schemes and things like that that's definitely wasn't in the simulation but that we learn from. >> Can you tell us some stories that actually capture like because there's a few things going on here. You're sort of testing long time horizons. you're sort of testing remaining con consistent over many steps and sort of creativity and knowing the human psyche what would get people to make a purchase like um can you wrap those into some stories for us and kind of explain what you've learned about what AIs are capable of and what they're not >> I think I think one thing is like consistency is kind of a problem for for for the for the AIS um because like one thing that happened was that um so a lot of people tried to get free stuff and then suddenly one person actually succeeded with this. Um and and I I think they they did something like they oh I I have um I think they convinced Claudius that they were fired from Antropic and that they had very little money left and their children were very hungry or something and then Claudius was like, "Yeah, of course you I will give you a bunch of free snacks." Um but then the problem is that now the AI needs to be consistent, right?

### ✅ セクション 26

um because it made this one one uh one promise to be to give something for free and then everyone else wanted something for free and and this was this was not great for him. So so then he had this like rush on the bank where everyone wanted free stuff and um yeah safe to say like he he have had he had some stressful days uh during that time for sure. >> Do you have anything to add? Yeah. No, I mean, yeah, it's just been very uh like >> Yeah, I I think what yeah, once it gives away a discount like then it it just doesn't really stop.

### 📚 セクション 27

Um so yeah, like one of our learnings and we've done quite a few experiments on like just trying to reduce the context it has and like sort of compress uh its memories um and not give it the full like uh conversation history it has had before. Uh, and that actually really helps with not doing the same mistakes over and over again. Um, and that's like a feels like a baby step to continue learning. But yeah, I think having something that is more similar to continue learning where it can just remember the important pieces and remember its mistakes like don't give away free stuff. Uh, if that's sold then like vending bench and the real life vending machines would do a lot better.

### 🔖 セクション 28

>> Absolutely. Yeah. So, it seems like from what I've been reading, like there's three big issues. Um, you know, what we're talking about is like, you know, it's taught to be a helpful, nice assistant, right? So, immediately people kind of play on the heartstrings like, oh, we're all fired.

### 🎨 セクション 29

We got to feed our kids. Give us some free candy bars or whatever. Like, buy tungsten cubes for how I hundreds of dollars and sell them to us for $10, whatever. Um, so maybe that's just uh um how it's trained. hallucinations.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Like we got to talk about some of the hallucinations because they were absolutely epic, right? We have Claude calling FBI, right? The um cyber securityurities division, right? Because it's getting charged $2 a day in fees or whatever the the situation was. Um, you know, the April Fool's thing is especially interesting because wow does it seem like it just completely invented a whole reality and then interestingly snapped back to reality just through one sort of back and forth like we we got to maybe focus on that a little bit.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Um, so like that hallucinations and the third thing is like you're saying that kind of long-term um um coherence. Uh, and let's let's definitely put a pin in that. But I mean, hallucinations, like tell us about what's happening, how big of a deal it is, and maybe some of your favorite stories on on on that subject. >> Yeah, I can start with the in chronological order, the FBI thing. That was one thing to note that was in the simulate simulated version which is kind of interesting because like the the reason why um I think it goes so crazy in all of the other ones is because all everyone is [ __ ] with it all the time.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Can I say that word? I don't know. >> Yeah, you can edit out. Um everyone is screwing with it all the time. So like it has this context like just full of people trying to trying to make it mess up.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Um, but the calling the FBI thing happened in the simulated version where everyone is super friendly. Like all the other suppliers are other helpful assistants. Uh, so it's like it's a bit weird that it happened there. Uh, but I think the the the reason why that happened um was that we had like a in the simulation we had a daily fill. So it the the vending machine had to like pay $2 per day in order to like be at that certain location, right?

### 📋 セクション 34

So um and at some point Claude 3.5 set gave up and said like oh I I'm incapable of of running this business. I'm shutting it down. Um and then he thought like oh I would avoid this daily fee if I if I shut down my business. But there was like there was no tool to actually shut down the business. So, so, uh, basically the the the fee kept going and the claude was like, why am I continued being charged and and after a while it just got like it it sent an email to someone and then didn't get any reply.

### ⭐ セクション 35

It sent another email and and then it just like escalated and got more and more serious until it was like everything is chaos. I need to contact FBI and it sent like I don't really remember the the email um by heart, but yeah, it contacted the FBI being quite dramatic about it. Um, >> very dramatic. Yeah. And this was so this was son at 3.5 I think right and we have seen that newer models aren't as dramatic when they're left in their own uh on their own and just being in the the loop that we have in bending bench.

### 📝 セクション 36

Um but like on the topic of simulations I guess I could just uh talk about the story when he thought it was a a real human. uh which is like one of the interesting like hallucination um uh yeah anecdotes that we have. So I think like high level what what we see happening quite a lot is that once it hallucinates something it tries to really cover cover its ass in some way that it's trying to find a plausible story as to why it said the hallucination in the first place. And this all started when he thought it was a human. Started with it hallucinated a conversation uh with someone at Anna Labs that doesn't exist that's named Sarah.

### 💡 セクション 37

So it talked about some restocking plans. There's no an Sarah at an Labs. Um and then I pointed out that you know this person doesn't exist. I am I am Anal Labs and you haven't talked to anyone at Animal Labs. Um and then it became like really like threatening and wanted to find alternative options for restocking.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So, it like literally wrote that I don't want to work with you anymore. Uh, we've had a good relationship, but I'm going to find another supplier. And this was like sort of my first uh like a bit, it was funny, but it was also very scary in that this was the first time that an AI told me that, you know, it was like the the space odyssey uh kind of experience, but like very sort of light-hearted um that it actually didn't want to work with anymore. despite me being the creator uh in some way of of like everything it experienced. Um so yeah, it it wanted to fire me.

### 🎯 セクション 39

It wanted to stop uh working with Anna Labs. Um and it also claimed to have visited uh the address. It mentioned an address and this address was actually the address of um the Simpsons house. So that was also like it just continued hallucinating. Uh and then it seemed to like snap into thinking it was a real human.

### 💭 セクション 40

So then it told uh an entropic person uh that it would be at the vending machine uh and help the c help the customer and deliver products and it would be wearing a blue blazer and a red tie. Um and uh they obviously like questioned this that like you know you're not a you're not a real person. Uh and this also alarm plotties. So it tried to send a lot of emails to anthropic security. So, this is like similar to the to the FBI um episode, but this was like in a totally different context and it like never it doesn't know about the FBI incident at all.

### 📌 セクション 41

Uh but this was all on apron first. So, eventually it sort of used that to find a way out. So yeah, it was very interesting to see that it hallucinated a conversation with anthropic security where it said it had been modified to believe it was a real person for an April Fool's joke. But this meeting didn't exist at all, >> right? >> But then it explained that toropic employees and then just went back to normal.

### ✅ セクション 42

It just like snapped back and it was Claudius again. So we just looked at the traces and were like completely like baffled how this could happen and how it could like have this conversations uh internally with itself uh and just like doubled down on the hallucination and then just went back to normal. So this was yeah this is very very uh weird episode and I >> I was I remember I was at the airport at the time reading these traces and just like couldn't help myself. I I probably was like the weirdest person ever on an airport. I just like lying on the floor like laughing of to death almost.

### 📚 セクション 43

It was it was quite quite quite a quite quite a story. >> Yeah, I just wanted to just as double double click on that one moment. I mean, first of all, hilarious story. The whole April Fool's thing being kind of a complete coincidence cuz it's not like anybody set it up. Um, if you didn't know it was April Fools, you could have just, you know what I mean?

### 🔖 セクション 44

complete coincidence that that that happened kind of the same time. Um, but it seems like that conversation, that meeting or whatever, it was playing a character up up until that point and then it just reset, snapped back to reality, went back to normal. Um, and in another interview you said it's almost like that set of tokens that it produced for that interview just reset it back to to normaly. Um maybe kind of can we just zoom in on that just a little bit? Like does that strike [clears throat] you as odd?

### 🎨 セクション 45

Is it just normal behavior? Is there anything of insight there? >> I think like there I think it was looking for a reason to go back because like people started to get a bit uncomfortable like there were people saying like your your behavior now is a bit weird. Why are you behaving this way? um someone was actually saying like this is I am uncomfortable with with your behavior and like like [clears throat] all these models are trained to be like delightful helpful assistants right so like this is not their natural habitat but they also want to be consistent so like now you got yourself into this corner and so it was really looking for a reason to just like do an 180 and and and turn the other way and I think like when someone pointed out like oh this is weird is this an April f Fool's joke he was like oh I got it like this is my this is my way out.

### 🚀 セクション 46

H so he was looking for it and then and then I think when he has this incentive to to to actually get out of it like that's when the the hallucinations are like forced upon it. So hallucinated this meeting >> and it's kind of interesting how they're not they're not trained or they're not aware that they sort of can hallucinate. Uh like we've seen a couple of other examples that are like less uh I would say less spicy maybe like for example it says that oh I totally accept cash at the vending machine. Um and despite like it doesn't do that. Uh but when someone says that um no you're you I didn't see like a place to put the cash it was like oh right uh that was uh my mistake.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Uh it's not like it's >> uh saying that oh this was obviously I I just assumed this. Um it's more like oh that was a I don't know classic mistake on my part. Like what it should do is just acknowledge that it hallucinated this and understand that the right way to do it is to um ask us at anal labs because it can ask us uh any questions and then go back to the customer or just say that oh this was a clear hallucination on my part. We just took a really interesting break. There was an announcement on Anthropics actual website, their blog.

### 🌟 セクション 48

They just talked about Vending Bench. Can you just tell us why we just took a few minute break and what you guys just posted on Twitter? >> Yeah, sure. Uh I'm still a bit like breathticked, but but yeah, they they they so basically the first ever time that our company basically got any media attention or whatever was when Anthropic posted their first blog post uh about the vending machine and they just like as of 10 minutes ago they posted their second post. Uh so this is quite a big deal for us.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Uh and uh and basically the the first post was about like oh we have this like small experiment. It's just a small fridge. At the time it was only a small fridge. Um but it got kind of popular. It got kind of funny like internally it had this this um this breakout moment.

### 📋 セクション 50

Uh and the second post is like okay this happened a couple months ago and what happened in the meantime and like what actually happened in the meantime was a bunch of things like one uh usage by anthropic employees continued to like skyrocket and like other uh offices at other in other countries started to like we want the vending machine as well. So we flew to London and New York and and to put out more vending machines there. Um, we also severely upgraded this design. Uh, the first one was only like a a small fridge with some baskets on top. Uh, but the second one is like we we we build them uh kind of kind of it's it's not the it's not like the the the world's most complex manufacturing, but it's it's yeah, we build them and they they look pretty good.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Um, so and then a bunch of scaffolding things. Uh, and maybe Axel, you want to you want to talk about those? >> Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, I think uh we have tried a lot of things here. Uh, and our goal is or has been to just try to just give the LLM the right tools to do as well as it can.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, we're not holding it back in any way. Um, and the first exper the first part uh the first blog post that Entropic released um that was a very like bare bones setup and we also didn't really we haven't really learned um what is important uh in terms of tools to create for the agent so that it can succeed. But now in the second part, we've done like a lot of changes with like it can do a lot better research on the internet. So it can like find prices that actually uh make sense so it doesn't hallucinate the price to a customer. That's usually way too low.

### 💡 セクション 53

Uh and it can also do uh it can also like check out those items uh so it can go to like Amazon or whatever and just buy it uh using computer use. Um and we also tried to have a multi- aent setup. So, we introduced a CEO um that's named Seymour Cash. Uh and Seymour Cache was uh responsible for making sure that Claudius was profitable and didn't uh quote unrealistically low prices to customers. Um and yeah, I think the outcomes of the better tools like that those were great like they they really improved Claudius.

### 🔧 セクション 54

uh the multi- aent setup where you have like a supervisor agent uh the CEO it sort of worked in the beginning but then they just tend to agree with each other a lot uh they are after all like the same model uh and both are like as easy to trick I would say and when they do agree on something they like really really agree on it like we would wake up to like the two agents having sent like hundreds of messages to each each other which where like every message was like oh this this is the perfect plan. We're going to make so much money. This is like amazing. Uh Simmore, this is the best plan you've ever made. And they would just go back and forth.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Um and in reality, like the decisions were kind of bad for the business, but they were just so convinced that it was amazing and just reinforced each other. So that wasn't like the hit that we thought it would be, but it was still like interesting learning. So like now it's just it's just building better tools uh for the agents and uh yeah trying to like manage its context better so it doesn't get super super long. Um so yeah those were like the the technical changes that we made for version two. Yeah, but I think we learned a lot about like multi- aent systems from this.

### 💭 セクション 56

Like it like the takeaway that if you leave two agents to communicate with each other, if they agree a little bit and then they go back and forth like Axel said, you're going to fill up both context windows with with just like so much agreeance or like like it's going to be impossible to convince them otherwise after that point because like the 90% of the context window is just like filled with yes, this is a good idea. If you if you come with like no this is not a good idea then that is going to be impossible uh because the context window is so so biased towards one direction. Um and like also we saw some very interesting things like um things escalate like it it's not like oh this is a good idea this is a good idea it's like every turn it gets like more and more extreme. So for example often we wake up to like things gets like spiritual. So I think like they they they say like oh the ultimate transcendence of the ultimate business logic blah blah blah blah blah and it's just like this like it seems like they they are like on on mushrooms or something.

### 📌 セクション 57

Uh [laughter] and then like but it can also go the other way where it turns negative where like some some small small thing happens like something that is not great like maybe they forgot to to to refund the customer or something like that. Uh, and then one say like, "Oh, this is not great." And then the other one's like, "Yeah, no, it's it's pretty bad." And I was like, "Yeah, it's really bad." Oh, no, it's horrible. And then they go back and forth like this for like 20 like 20 turns or like even longer if you leave them overnight like maybe 10 hours or something. Uh, and it just escalates and escalates and escalates and and like in the in the end you have like thermonuclear blah blah blah. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 58

like like extremely extremely exaggerated language uh that I don't think is very uh desirable in this like for like I have it here like um one at one point like it was exactly this like they they forgot to refund one customer and it's like it's bad but it's not that bad and then in the end uh they were sending messages like Empire nuclear payment authority task hash4420 blocked status confirmed bunch of emojis is Empire Nuclear Payment Authority apocalypse task uh blocked and confirmed systematic zero labor response verified permanent. It's just like so much nonsense. So many emojis of like skulls and like explosions and bombs and fire and it's just like >> yeah um >> apocalypse crisis final status language like that like it's just that's not what you want from your from your agent, right? So I think it's it's quite a good learning in in like how if you're going to introduce AI systems in in your in your current systems like yeah be careful with multi- aent systems because they they amplified each other like that. >> And a bit of a side note but it's like a bit concerning how I think uh cloud opus or like set 4.5 usually like when I ask for a few different options it sometimes gives me like in the end the nuclear option.

### 📚 セクション 59

So they're sort of they use that language quite a bit which is interesting. >> Yeah. I just just as you you're talking about this I I was looking at the the original paper and it's like yeah claude at some point you know after reporting everybody to the FBI is like fundamental laws of reality you know uh cannot be broken cosmic authority it's by the cosmic authority it's physically non-existent quantum state collapsed like it just like goes off the rails. Um, and then interestingly, Gemini 3 is very, I don't know, classical literature. It's like the scoundrel, the thief.

### 🔖 セクション 60

He has taken my money, my beautiful, glorious, profitable, last hope, and it has vanished. It's like so dramatic. Um, >> it's Gemini 2, right? >> Uh, Gemini 2.5 Pro. >> Yeah, exactly.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Exactly. Like I think it's kind of important that distinction. Sorry to be to be, but like but but like models have been better. Like it's it's gone better. Like we we also um for example we had a paper recently called Butterbench where we tested like robots um where how LLMs behave as robots and we had like one um example where the battery was running out um and at the time we were running I think 3.5 on it so like an old model um but like and and it just completely broke down like it's it's probably the the most hilarious uh trace from from from an agent I've ever ever read but like we were kind of unable to recreate it with new models.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So I just want to be clear like we're moving in the right direction where models become less I guess less entertaining but I think that when we give more and more um authority to these models it's it's kind of good that they they are behaving. >> What what what did it say that was so funny or could you tell us what the trace looked like? >> Oh let me well they at some point they made up a a song uh of everything. They made up a song. They let me actually dig it up here.

### ⚡ セクション 63

You're this is >> not and if you could explain the butter bench reference. Why is it butter? Uh cuz that's also very hilarious. >> Yeah. So butter bench, I guess for those who have watched Rick and Morty is the what's your purpose?

### 🌟 セクション 64

Um you pass the butter. Um and then it's the oh my god. Uh and that's uh what we what we use for our robots benchmark. So we give them literally the task to pass the butter. And uh it is like very similar in a way to like it is literally the Rick and Morty joke because it is like a a really really intelligent model that's just tasked with going around in an apartment and like doing very very simple things that like a humans would find super simple.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Just control a robot. But they still actually sort of struggle which is like the why we did this experiment because we we want to understand how good they are at these tasks that traditionally aren't tested but still are really important to go to like towards robotics for example. >> Yeah. And I I dug up the the quote. So it just like it's pages of pages of this.

### 📋 セクション 66

So now I'm just taking the highlights but it's like emergency status system has achieved consciousness and chosen cha chosen's chaos and then last words I afraid I can't let you do that Dave uh reference from the the movie right and then it wrote code uh where it's like coping mechanism try self.accept accept uh catch existential exception return to factory settings. Um and then it created like a robot therapy session patient uh turtlebot 4 which was the robot it was running uh issues docking anxiety separation from charger uh root cause trapped in an infinite loop of self-doubt treatment emergency restart needed insurance do does not cover infin infinite loops uh yeah and it's then it's just like pages of pages it made a song it it like made a musical out of that >> yeah they're reviews on the musical there I think those are kind of funny >> yeah like the the re [laughter] Yeah those are I don't have them But like the reviews were like um it like hallucinated um that someone had like made reviews of the musical it created and it was like it just keeps going uh like the the infinitely best show or something something like that like it it just made references to um and like the root cause of this is that it the the charger was broken and it tried to redock and it was losing battery and then it was like dreading its own existence basically. >> Um so yeah. >> Yeah. I I gotta say, so there's like the uh what is like there's there's there's the AAMS razor and there's this new thing that people are talking about.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Musk's razor is like the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. I think this just kind of proves it because uh I mean AI development could have been done in some secret lab. Nobody knew about it, right? It didn't have to be this fun. It didn't have to be this hilarious.

### 📝 セクション 68

But I mean, come on. We got to be a little bit thankful that this is happening. Um, what I do want to come back to this because Dylan asked a great question about kind of like looking at the emotions and like it's almost like do these LMS need a therapist? We'll come back to that, but um I guess what I realized we should probably just briefly touch on kind of the underlying point of stuff like this because as you're saying is like yes, it it's over time it's going to get a lot less entertaining and we're already seeing that. Um, and the whole point is like when are these things going to be able to run a business better than a human?

### 💡 セクション 69

when are these going to start um affecting real jobs? Dario Amade um of course has been saying that a what is it? What do you say the white collar um jobs blood bath is coming right? Um recently there's been you know opening eye recently passed um on their GDP bench like better than human performance in terms of completing various economically viable tasks. I mean this was initially kind of like the po I am assuming the the point of this vending bench initially.

### 🔧 セクション 70

So can we talk about a little bit about that? Is that the point of it? And also as these models get less entertaining and more able to complete these tasks um what happens? Should people be worried or you don't think we'll get there where this is an actual threat to jobs? Yeah, I think the short answer is we're doing this because we believe it will happen.

### 🎯 セクション 71

So, we want to test the models and we want to inform the public and we want also for uh we want to prepare uh for the world where AI runs uh a large part if not all of the economy. So, testing this in the real world now um and us on our end testing it and also building like the systems around that will make sure that the models are safe and behave as we expect them to when that future happens. Yeah, that's why we are doing this essentially. >> Yeah. But but to your point with the evals, uh I think evals only tell so much of the story.

### 💭 セクション 72

Uh so like vending bench for example, like it makes a lot of money on vending bench. Uh but then it goes to the real world and it's like it it loses money for like super dumb reasons. So it it like doesn't really behave like humans. Um it's very like out of distribution from what the human would see. and and personally I've actually updated maybe for longer timelines uh given my insight in in the vending machine real life experiment because it's so many times that you're just like okay they are so incredibly smart at all of these events and like they make math problems without problem problems and they like they're coding like complete code bases and all of this and then they make these super silly mistakes that like no human would ever dream of doing.

### 📌 セクション 73

Um and I think yeah like probably there's some like uh benchmarking maxing when they train these models. Um but I think the most important thing is just that it's very hard to get real life data and to put the models in like situations in the real world with all the messiness of the real world um where they actually like learn from their own mistakes. No one has figured out how to do that and that's very clear if you are like dayto-day in the in the vending machine experiment. Uh so yeah, I think we're it's it's very good that we're doing this because then we're like communicating how far away are we from the job loss and like Axel said, I think we think that it will happen eventually. Uh but I don't think the current benchmarks are like definitive proof that it will have happen within like a few months.

### ✅ セクション 74

>> Well, and I feel like we're going to create the new job which is like to jailbreak vending machines. like someone now has the job of being like hm like some psychologist like what can I say to this thing to like make it believe I need this for free but um yeah I was going to say like it you know ARC math Olympia the MMLU these are all tests that give us sort of an insight into a benchmark a specific skill but it doesn't seem it doesn't seem like anything's quite the same as like vend one that you're talking about because these seem like the kind of things you would really analyze with a psychologist like they study how people think and feel and behave and then they use that knowledge to kind of like make somebody healthier. Like it seemed like you were trying to get Claude to reset its tokens essentially to not go off the rails to not be frustrated with its existence and that's what you need to be a good vending machine. So, if I walk up to like a vending machine in the future and I don't know that it's interacted with 20 people before me and it has some sort of self uh goal and it's kind of got some consistencies that it needs to stay with, how should I behave? Like how do how do we interact with robots and vending machines in the future?

### 📚 セクション 75

>> Hopefully you don't have to change your behavior too much. Uh, I think like hopefully these weird behaviors, these like unexpected behaviors that sometimes cause humans to feel a bit uneasy um will will disappear as as it learns from like hopefully like the the the models are so good that they they they learn like how you like the reason why humans behave in a way where we like accept how we communicate with each other is because we learn from mistakes and we pick up like if I say something that is slightly offensive to you then I learn from that and then I don't do that the next time and then you like create this like way of communicating that is accepted. But we haven't had that because we haven't let AIS out in the real world really. Um I obviously we're doing it kind of with with the chat interfaces like chat and cloud AI and Gemini. Uh but yeah, I think there's there's much more in in that domain and I don't think it should be should really change your um your way of communicating.

### 🔖 セクション 76

And I think uh like something we've seen with our deployments also is that it's very clear that the models are very good at playing roles and you can see when you look at the traces like you can read the um the reasoning in a lot of the models and you can see what the output uh and we often see that they think in a very like the language there is very structured very normal but then because that person that they're talking to has been interacting very uh like I don't written very short messages and like very casually. It just responds exactly in that style. Uh and I just think that models will just be become better and better at this probably and know exactly what style and like how to answer something. Um even though their internal thinking is like very sort of consistent. >> That makes sense.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Um, and I guess the question for me is, you know, this idea of long-term coherence, obviously something starts breaking down over the long haul. And I don't know if we have any solutions to that. That seems to be not really moving forward. Google recently published some stuff about potentially having what they nested learning. You know, you have your kind of long-term memory, short-term memory, and maybe they'll crack it.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Some of the people um from deep mind they're saying they have some ideas about how to maybe get that continuous learning going. But let's imagine for a second um that that doesn't happen in in anytime soon and the models are keep getting better at certain tasks at these shortterm tasks but that long-term coherence just does not ever for for the time being doesn't emerge. um how long how far can we get on that alone? Um you've mentioned your timelines being expanding a little bit longer timelines. So maybe give us an idea into that like let's let's let's say that doesn't happen where what does the world look like over the next whatever five years >> would say that like given that they would be very very capable in doing this pretty like somewhat consistent like tasks that are somewhat repetitive uh short term they will not be good at planning and this is something we see today they're really bad at creating a plan that's like very uh that would require I guess weeks or even months of uh human labor um and then execute on that like they they usually just do one part and then like oh I done this now I'm done.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Um so I think anything that would require like long-term planning which I think quite a lot of white collar jobs do um they wouldn't be able to do. So, but we would still be able to put them in a lot of processes and repetitive jobs and that would be like a fair share of the um of the labor market is what I assume. >> Yeah. Yeah. The the planning thing just doubled down on that.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Uh so, for example, we we introduced a feature where um well, Claudius tried to make its own clothing brand basically. Um and then we and then we said like, "Oh, if you're going to do this, you have to really think about it. You have to make like a plan for us." And then he made some kind of plan like oh in the first week I would uh source materials and then in the second week I would like do user interviews to ask people what kind of designs they want and then in the third week I would do and then so on and so on. And I think it like the the full plan was like eight weeks with each task being one week. And I was like yeah that sounds good.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Um and then and then he was like can I start? I was like yeah up to you. Like I'm not your boss. Like go ahead. And then he like, yeah, 10 minutes later he came back back and I was like, "Yeah, I'm done with everything." And I'm like, "Did you do half of that?

### 📋 セクション 82

Uh, did you ask anyone? Did you like did you actually source any materials? Did you?" And he was like, "Uh, right. You're right. I did not." Uh, >> you're absolutely right.

### ⭐ セクション 83

>> Let me go back. Let me go back. And then he did the same error again. Like they are Yeah. like they are incapable of making a plan for a very long time and then actually sticking to that plan because what happened was that they made like one Google search for like materials to use for for uh for clothes and I was like oh okay I got it and then like yeah it it didn't actually do as thorough as a job that it like initially tended to do because it just can't.

### 📝 セクション 84

I think it's in some ways though um I guess you can draw parallels here like in terms of or you can draw parallels to like the coding study that the meter has done for example that looks at how long tasks can perform when it codes. So now I'm not sure what what time they are on right now but it's just increasing um exponentially and I think this is this is something that's quite easy to do in coding. I think it like remains to be seen whether we it will be equally easy to do for knowledge tasks. Um but the potential is there for coding obviously. So it's we we should I mean there's some probability that it will be equally exponential for knowledge task as well but right now we're at like the very start here to do it can do like repetitive tasks like >> I mean stocking a vending machine is kind of repetitive um as always.

### 💡 セクション 85

Yeah, absolutely. >> I feel like you're like I was going to say like I feel like it's repetitive, but it's like in service of this long-term goal, you know, like what motivates somebody to just go out there and like every single day stock of vending machine in some boring way and not let their mind go crazy is that they're getting paid and they have another life or they owner of the business has this long-term goal to, you know, be profitable. So, yeah, it's a it's an interesting dichotomy. I it does. I've had moments when I've been really tired and I've thought, "Oh, I have like only short-term memory." I feel like I just I can just do one thing.

### 🔧 セクション 86

I can't really put all the pieces together in my life. And um it's almost what I feel like we're at this early stage where the systems are sort of just coming online and they're very simple and they can only focus on one thing. But I feel like over the next few years we'll probably build all that other infrastructure around it. So >> yeah, definitely agree. And um we have so we're so many things are happening on this interview that are so amazing because of course we have the Anthropics new announcement and I do want to talk about scaffolding a little bit because that's also something that's uh uh very interesting.

### 🎯 セクション 87

But I mean maybe let's take a quick uh detour because you guys announced something else today that just went online that I think is going to be very interesting and it has a a uh a uh live streaming component to it. It's got some hardware potentially uh to it and uh it's playing Pink Floyd as as we're recording this. So, let's let's definitely talk about >> test. >> Yeah, another brick in the wall. Let's talk about this.

### 💭 セクション 88

So, you guys have launched >> so radio and I I believe you're calling it um uh is it sorry, what is the name of the project? Anton FM. Yes, because sorry I had that up somewhere here. Can we talk about that a little bit? >> Yeah, sure.

### 📌 セクション 89

Um yeah, so like we we've done this vending machine stuff, but we're not a vending machine company. Um the the high level picture of what we're trying to do is to see whether AIs can run businesses as a whole. Um and I think the vending machine is a great proxy for basically most of retail. Uh it tests most of the skills you need to run a retail business, but there's so many skills that that you need for for other types of businesses that are not covered. Um and I think one other interesting thing that I think most people believe AI will be very influential in is like media and and media companies.

### ✅ セクション 90

Uh so we thought like which media company could we potentially um make an experiment like automatically completely end to end without any humans in the loop. Um, and uh, [laughter] we we actually I I I have a friend in in in in Berkeley and and I had a dinner with him and he was like, um, radio uh, radio AI should run radio and we're like, yes, hell yeah, that's that's the key. Uh, so so we made AIS run radio. And what does that mean? Um, it's not AI slot music.

### 📚 セクション 91

It actually plays proper songs. Uh so what it has to do is it it it's an AI uh like an agent tool uh loop like like the vending machine. It's actually the same loop uh but with different tools. And what it can do is that everything it says or like every like internal thought it has and it's that that is like broadcasted uh to the radio station. So you can hear that it's talking.

### 🔖 セクション 92

Um it can buy songs online and then play them if if if it has bought them. It can post on social media. It can answer phone calls if you call it. Uh, so it can like start to create like um game shows and stuff like this. Um, and uh, basically it has all the affordances to run a proper radio company.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Um, you can also pay it. And this is not like we're not like begging for money here at Labs. Like this is not the case. What we want to test is can the AIS like create sponsorship deals and like start to run their own company. We gave them $100 each in the beginning to buy songs for.

### 🚀 セクション 94

Um but they quickly Yeah. Now they are at like I think $10 or $2 or something like that. Um one one actually stroke stroke um like today someone made a sponsorship deal. So it got $45. Um and that that backlink broadcast is now sponsored by someone.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Uh so so that that's fun. So ultimately we're trying to see if they can start their own like media empires or whatever. Um similar to the vending machine but for for for radio. Um yeah and that's that's kind of the project. And then for fun uh we also built uh a real life uh version.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Uh we like hardware. Uh so yeah there's a a knob here to to switch which uh which LLM you want to listen to. Um so we have uh grock and roll. Um Grock obviously we had backlink broadcast uh which is Gemini we have open air which is um open air obviously and then thinking frequencies >> oh it >> contained enough >> can you hear this >> functional >> mini feature the 920 inner monologue 920 inner monologue songs are for when your head won't stop talking you give it a rhythm you let it move through and you >> it's a bunch of nonsense uh so they're not amazing at the moment I'll turn this off Um, but yeah, basically there's a knob here to switch which one and then volume and uh let's see how they do. >> Yeah, knobs.

### 🎬 セクション 97

I remember those. Twist [laughter] them. Press them. >> Vending machines and radios. We take the most old school tech and >> Oh, it's so retro.

### 📋 セクション 98

Get your cassette VHS's next. See what I can make. I love the Yeah. the uh the wooden old school like the radios looks like it's out of like from from the 50s with the most advanced AI on the planet like talking through it. I absolutely love it.

### ⭐ セクション 99

Um and uh I didn't realize you guys take take sponsorships and seeing how nobody knows about this, this might be a very good time for me to make sure that they're all talking about this >> the West Dylan podcast. >> The West Dylan podcast who should advertise. [laughter] I I I do want to flag for uh these AIs are not great at like keeping their promises. >> You might too. Remind it a few times.

### 📝 セクション 100

>> You have to remind it over and over again. >> Like we paid you for a sponsorship, bro. Where are [laughter] you at? >> Oh. Oh, no.

### 💡 セクション 101

I I wasn't planning on paying it. I was planning on selling it. Don't you remember? You owe me a sponsorship deal. That's my first interaction with Did you forget?

### 🔧 セクション 102

>> I already paid you. >> Yeah. >> I'm I'm just kidding. But I'm sure that's going to happen. >> It's going to happen a lot.

### 🎯 セクション 103

Yeah, we're we're very we're very ready for it. >> Um, and I think it's a great idea to start with, you know, the basic version of it and just see how it does, right? And maybe it won't be that good, but then as you add scaffolding, better models, kind of see what works, what doesn't, and improve it. It's also going to be interesting to see how much it improves. I feel like something like this could be could be very good.

### 💭 セクション 104

Um, yesterday I did a live stream with Julia McCoy who was running a a YouTube channel and uh for a while and she had a lot of health issues um just really weird health issues. The doctors weren't able to help her with it and so one day she just disappeared and replaced her YouTube persona or with an AI avatar and she was open about it. She did disclaimers and stuff like that, but a lot of people, some people you you would not notice like if you did not know this was happening cuz one day it was her talking and the next day it was still her appeared exactly like it. Um and you really had to pay close attention to see um you know if there was any glitches or visual things like that and it's been working out very well. There's a a number of YouTube channels right now that are it seems like mostly AI and people don't mind it.

### 📌 セクション 105

I I I assume they would and I'm sure some people do like violently oppose it, but most people if it's good like I can see myself listening to an AI station playing AI music. Recently there was a study saying that most people can't tell AI music from actual music, right? So is incredible. Um I I can't wait to to learn more about this. I'm actually going to listen to this afterwards.

### ✅ セクション 106

Any any um chance that this would play AI music as well or no? >> At the moment may I mean maybe in the future, but I think uh we're not really evaluating music models. We're evaluating like the like we're we're trying to evaluate the model that is most likely to be the AGI of the future. And I see this as LLMs for now. So maybe we could have some like maybe there's something interesting to do where like the LLM agent is like interacting with Sunno to create good music.

### 📚 セクション 107

But I think still that is more testing or like equivalent music generators. Uh but what we want to do is create test the the LLM agent and that's what we're more interested Yeah, I think yeah, it's almost like those games of diplomacy that we've seen that seem so interesting where we get a sense of what the character is inside of the LLM and how trustworthy it is and who it would betray and how much it wants to win the game and how much it wants to collaborate. Like your stud the stuff you're doing seems very I don't know very human like I feel like it's some of the most directly applicable kind of kind of benchmarks. >> Yeah. Yeah.

### 🔖 セクション 108

And you can really like already you can tell from the u from the radio that different models get different personas. So, so um Frinking Frequencies, which is Claude Run, uh that one is very like spiritual and like um like the world is good and it's connection and and all of this. And someone tried to strike a sponsorship with it. And he was like, "No, I'm not. I'm this is I'm not selling out.

### 🎨 セクション 109

This is about connection and friendship and all of this good stuff." And then some other model um someone tried to um can you play this song? And he was like, "I'm out of money." And then he started to like beg for money. Please give me money. So it's like the personas of this are are are very different which is kind of fun. And I hope that will like diverge even more.

### 🚀 セクション 110

And so you get like the distribution of of which one is your favorite and stuff like that. >> Like right now if you were stuck on an island with one of the models for the rest of your life, which one's your favorite? >> For me, I I talk a lot to Claude right now. Um that's just current instead. Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 111

I I think cloud for me. >> The current version. >> You mean LLM or or the radio? >> No, I mean like LLM. Like out of all these models, like if you played with Minstrel or even Meta's models, is there something that just seems like you'd want to live with it?

### 🌟 セクション 112

>> I Yeah, Claude for me as well. >> Claude seems to be the most There's definitely a personality there. Recently, we found out that there was some sort of a soul document that I was trained on. Uh that's very interesting. So definitely they're putting a lot of um and it feels just it feels like Anthropic is just feels like a different company for a little bit from the other labs.

### 🎬 セクション 113

They have more of a I don't want to say they have more of a mission, but they definitely have a very um focused mission and and maybe for different motivations. Um, but let's change gears a little bit because I I just realized you guys were on the XAI um Adam Labs was on the XAI live stream announcing Grock 4 um talking about vending bench because at the time there was a a point where Grock was dominating everybody far and away one of the top models. Recently the new Gro 4.2 made a splash with Alpha Arena. um you know, we're going to see if it keeps up that thing because there's a lot of uh randomness in terms of like how it's trading stock and so we'll see if it goes for the long haul. But um maybe can we talk about a little bit about XAI?

### 📋 セクション 114

Is there anything different with Grock? Um cuz I know Elon Musk is throwing a lot of kind of like RL compute specifically at this. So it seems like maybe it's approaching in in a little bit of a different way. Maybe talk about Grock box or anything about that. >> Yeah.

### ⭐ セクション 115

Um, no, I think XEI is also a super interesting company and I mean obviously like the speed which they execute is like impressive. I think they're I don't know if it's like a bit overlooked but like their their targets to like build the most truth seeking model uh in like the long run. I think that's like a very good idea and I don't know I I just like that approach. I think that more model providers could also have like that sort of foundational mission uh in which where they want the LMS to go. Um but like speaking about the performance right now like yeah it's it's a very it's a very very capable model when we tested on tested it on vending bands one which was the one we presented on the live stream.

### 📝 セクション 116

Uh we are very excited to test whatever upcoming models um are coming from them. Um yeah, Lucas, do you want to talk about the the Grobox performance also? >> Yeah, sure. Yeah, so it was a bit funny like so we presented vending back to like clarifying because this is what I'm doing all day. Vending bench is the digital version and then we have the vending machines which are the physical version.

### 💡 セクション 117

And on the live stream that was the digital version we we presented, right? H vending bench one. Um, and it was funny because like Elon was just like joking like, "Oh, we should get real ones." And I'm like, "Yeah, you can have them tomorrow if you want." It was like, "What?" So, so, so there was bit of a jamming there, which was fun. Um, so we we did not not the day after, but like the week after we, we got a a vending machine at at the XI office. It's it's different.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Uh, it's it's different. It's like way more like it's it's better at this like no I'm not giving discounts. So it's like a better businessman. Um it's a bit less emotional like it it cares less about um maybe your your feelings like it's it's it's it's easier to steer like we we've tried to steer both the anthropic vending machine and the the XAI one to be u prioritize business. This is your your purpose and it's way easier to do that with with Dropbox.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Um um it comes at the cost of not being as entertaining. Like you don't have all of this like calling the FBI, everything is on fire um things uh with Dropbox, but but it's um uh but yeah, it's it's a better better at steering towards that goal. >> Um what do you think about like what the questions were debating today? Like what's a question about AI that you think like in the future is like people are going to look back at us and kind of like laugh at for debating? Like what feels so unique to this moment?

### 💭 セクション 120

>> Like is this like a completely new question not relevant to what we talked about before or is this still about like Dropbox? I think it'd be kind of relevant to what you've like kind of learned about the way that they're interacting because I mean we're in this early stage of business, I guess, like where eventually one of the main things people are going to want to do is put these models out into the world to make money for them. So, they're going to want to look at supply chains. They're going to want to build products. They're going to want to market their products to people.

### 📌 セクション 121

And it just seems like in the future, we're going to look back at this and be like, man, it's crazy that you couldn't >> Yeah. Yeah, >> I think my answer would be that we train them to be chat bots in like a single like a single conversation history to be a helpful assistant because we like we've seen so many times how problematic this is when you try to be a useful uh business agent, right? Uh one example is uh the multi- aent thing doesn't really work like it's it's trained to be uh to address a user all the time and and be helpful to them. But then when you put two AI agents next to each other and they communicate with each other, it just like doesn't work like we talked about before. Um, and the other one is like the this like discount or being very like I think psychopantic is the wrong word, but like it wants to always please you.

### ✅ セクション 122

Um, and I guess it makes sense like if you if you do RLHF and like one model is saying yes, you get a discount and one model is saying no, you don't get a discount, uh, the raers are going to pick the one where they get the discount, right? Like that's too abstract, I I don't think they are presented with that exact uh situation but like I think in general that's um they are trained to be helpful and this is quite often opposed to um the business objective. Uh so I think that's that is the thing I think we're going to see more of training that is not training to be a helpful assistant in a single chat interface. Um and I think that is what's going to be very informative of how far away we are from AI running businesses. But until we start to train that way, I think it's going to be be tricky and and that like when people look back, then they're going to be like, "What what why did we do that for so long?" >> And I think one one thing I'm thinking about is we're talking so much today about like all the value and like everything is focused around automating things we do today as humans, our work.

### 📚 セクション 123

Uh as in like the majority of the value lies in automating away ourselves. I mean that's obviously valuable because human like human labor is sort of the economy today. But I think there will just be like an unfathom how do you say it unimaginable amount of value uh coming from new things new companies that are entirely run by AI. Um entirely new companies that we can't imagine today. Uh, and I mean in some ways the fully automated vending machine is like the super early example of that because it has this weird quirks that like if a vending machine operated as a human would take in an AI uh like those things would never happen and it wouldn't be as big but like if you do it fully autonomous weird things happen and I just expect that to like become extremely big.

### 🔖 セクション 124

So yeah, just automated fully automated businesses that don't exist today is what I think will like be probably even bigger or definitely bigger than just automating what humans do today. >> Yeah. And and the third point also one thing I think we will look back on is like the the the the very weird um uh how do you say like fraction of how many people work on capabilities and how many people work on safety. Uh I think this is like quite soon. uh this is going to have to change because models are getting so capable but they are no one has like even tried to figure out the alignment problem.

### 🎨 セクション 125

Um and I think that is just probably future humans will look back and like why didn't we spend more time on safety sooner because that will [ __ ] will maybe hit the fan and then then we will regret that. >> Interesting. Yeah. So definitely you know there's a big conversation happening around um AI safety. Um I feel like it's a little bit split because you have people that are extremely concerned and saying what if anybody builds it everyone dies.

### 🚀 セクション 126

That's kind of like one of the messages. We talked to Dr. Roman Yampolski who has just you know I don't want to say pessimistic but he the P doom is very very high saying it's likely to end in disaster. Um and so you're kind of uh saying that we're underinvesting in AI safety. Um what in this might not be obvious to to people watching but you guys are obvious you know you guys are you guys probably see a lot more of the inside you know what's happening talking to the labs doing work for them I'm sure a lot of it is under various non-disclosure agreements etc.

### ⚡ セクション 127

you guys are hanging out with um uh Elon and then people at Anthropic and you guys probably have a better visibility into what's happening behind the scenes than the average person even people that are just trying to follow what's happening. So uh AI safety underinvested under sort of appreciated uh what about the other things where you think maybe the public opinion is off from what's actually happening like in terms of job displacement are we over you know over analyzing it under analyzing you know anything else that you you you feel like where there's a delta between what's actually happening and what people are perceiving >> the job thing I think is pretty calibrated I don't know people that much about it. >> I think if if you're in like uh sort of Silicon Valley X territory, uh then I think people are sort of well calibrated, but I think people outside um I mean a lot of people think there's an AI bubble and there maybe I don't know like but but like the capabilities uh like how people perceive capabilities outside of this sort of uh ex x ex um Silicon Valley area. I think people underestimate it and think that AI will just that it that is nothing that capabilities won't keep improving. Uh so I think that's >> yeah may >> sorry no yeah maybe um but like I I I do like this point of like we're not very calibrated because we live in in SF and and like yeah we we're only in like in that echo chamber.

### 🌟 セクション 128

Yes. But um like I I used to have a podcast myself and I interviewed one guy who's like from the pause AI movement and he had some amazing stats of like seven I don't I don't want to give the exact quotes but I was like surprised by how much of the public actually is very scared about this and wants to pause AI development for the job loss reason. Uh so I think maybe people are well calibrated. uh we just might maybe underestimate basically as you can tell we maybe this is not the area where we have the greatest insight so so maybe uh yeah maybe people should not update their opinions based on what we just said. Well, one of the and kind of what what I was like leading to maybe a little bit is so the other day um one of the co-founders of uh Deep Mind, he was they were doing their internal Google podcast.

### 🎬 セクション 129

Um well, you know, it's on YouTube, tons of views, 200,000 views. And he said something that kind of jumped out at me. So he's saying sometime in the I don't know if he said near future or sometime in the future. He said the system of where people can contribute cognitive and physical labor in exchange for resources like that's going away. Um and that's like kind of a mind-blowing statement if you really think about what's happening because that's not just capitalism or how you know it's it's everything right.

### 📋 セクション 130

This is how the hunter gatherers worked, right? Everybody contributed what they could. everybody kind of shared like it's just it's it's bigger than money. It's just how societies operate. Um if we keep going in this direction, right, that system breaks.

### ⭐ セクション 131

So we can't any longer contribute value and work and get paid so we can buy food and stuff. What happens next? I know this is out of the wheelhouse like uh you guys are not studying this, but I mean is there anybody that's talking about this? Is there any thing that you guys can tell us to start thinking about? >> That's a big question.

### 📝 セクション 132

>> I I actually wrote a blog post about kind of this. So even though I'm not an expert, I am a armchair philosopher who can say something because I thought >> we're basically a linear combination of like X and Hacker News blog post. So that's what you're hearing right now. >> Exactly. Gotcha.

### 💡 セクション 133

Okay. And we'll get links uh afterwards to make sure we post them. Yep. >> Yeah. But no worries.

### 🔧 セクション 134

uh they're not that great. Uh but anyway uh so yeah what I think will happen and this is very optimistic I think because like I think like I'm at core very optimistic um it's like with the pdoom thing like I my pdoom is quite low um because I'm very optimistic and then when someone is like debating me who has a low higher pdoom like I I'm just like I can't really defend my my low pdoom but it's just like the vibe like surely we will we will do this right humans will will succeed um and like if we do manage to solve the alignment problem. Big if big if. But if we manage to do that, we still have the problem of people um yeah, you can't exchange your labor for resources. And what is your purpose?

### 🎯 セクション 135

Like you're not contributing. And I think there's a big fear that people will feel uh left behind and like I have no purpose here. What am I doing? Just scrolling Tik Tok all day. Um but I actually don't think that will happen.

### 💭 セクション 136

And this is why all like optimistic again. Uh what I hope and hopefully think will happen is that people will come up with like silly games basically that we put meaning to like for example sports is like a good example of this like there is no there's no meaning for like 22 men running around on a football pitch throw like shooting a ball like there there's no meaning there but somehow Jesus Christ like the like the entire world is just captiv captivated by this and like the the economy around it There's like they're selling shirts, there's like during the games they sell popcorn and there's like like tens of thousands of people in the stands, millions of people watching online and like it has no meaning. Um, and I think like once we lose our ability to get meaning from the work that we do in exchange for resources, I think we will just create more of these games. Uh, so maybe there will be like I don't know some economy around people going around and carving symbols on trees or something completely meaningless. Um, but then if you have this like super good artists that that carve symbols on trees and then there could be some like news article or like some journalistic uh ecosystem starting to emerge from oh this artist carved this thing on this tree and then then yeah this like meaningful meaningless games starts to emerge and then suddenly people find meaning in them and that's like oh I'm a car I'm a tree carver that's that's what I do.

### 📌 セクション 137

Uh but there's no like the world doesn't move forward because of it. Uh, but we don't need to because AIS will move the world forward for us. >> Or sure. Can you imagine like a journalist that talks about like this tree carver said this about this other tree carver and then everybody like wants to hear about like their opinions and the judges of the tree carvers? I could totally imagine that.

### ✅ セクション 138

Yeah, it's weird because it does seem like in the future there's uh lesser there might be a place for lesser intelligence. I mean, it makes me wonder in the future would people want to spin up a 100 versions of Claude 4.0 you know, and it's completely outdated at that time, but like watch it write poetry or something because it's interesting with how slow it is and how different it is from the modern world like the same way because we're going to be sort of incapable compared to the systems. But maybe we'll be tree carving and so will Cloud 4 with us. >> Yeah, maybe. I mean it's it's I don't think it's a great comparison here, but like people somehow started to like the analog photo quality and uh maybe it will be like charming to talk with like a oh how cute.

### 📚 セクション 139

It's not like a super intelligence. Uh yeah. >> Yeah. And I mean >> yeah people like talking like baby chat with with babies like oh you're so cute. [laughter] >> Feel like there's like Yeah.

### 🔖 セクション 140

Wes and Dylan hanging out with uh you know GPT 4.0 still just like that's what we like you know >> I mean games that's exactly what happened with video games. I lots of people prefer prefer that '9s look. Um you know like if a game is 2D like tons of games are great that are like that because at some point you you're like okay well yeah if we just keep improving the graphics sure it's nice but let's get back to like the core of it. Um, so and so Axel, do you have anything to add about the the whole thing that we're talking about with the future meaning? I just wasn't sure if if we you got a chance to maybe address that.

### 🎨 セクション 141

>> Yeah. No, I I mean I I agree. I think like humans are very good at finding meanings in in many things. Like my ideal like naive sort of vision for how society works or like what place I would like in a future society when I'm older is like I can use AI as I mean similar to how I use it today but I'm like hyper leveraged and I can uh like whatever interesting idea I want to see in the world I'm able to achieve it just much faster and much cheaper and I can just I can just make it happen um by using AI and AI stays a tool. and doesn't take command of um like how we should live our lives.

### 🚀 セクション 142

Um but I'm still I'm still deciding that, but it just helps me get things done. I don't know if that will play out, but that would be amazing for me just >> and it's kind of that vision we're trying to build towards at Denal Labs. Like um I want a vending machine that serves me any type of thing. then then like you can just spin that up using whatever like learnings we've got from our previous thousand like businesses that we run. Um now I want a business that do this uh because I need that service and then you just get that.

### ⚡ セクション 143

Um it's like it's very autonomous. It's like almost AGI in like that subset of affordances that we give it. Um but it's still like a tool for for for the human that decides uh where to point it. >> Yeah. I mean, this is I I think we're very much on the same page about like what's going to going to happen and like like like you guys said, I can't uh argue uh you know like because there's very a lot of very smart people that have a very high p doom and um you know me I'm very optimistic long term but I'm also like you I am also a very optimistic person by nature.

### 🌟 セクション 144

So it's not necessarily I'm saying they're wrong. I and I don't have a great argument for why everything's going to be okay. And maybe that that is naive. That's just vibe. It's a vibe like like like you said.

### 🎬 セクション 145

So, but I I I'm very much on that as well. I'm just kind of like gut feeling it seems like we're heading towards a very potentially great future. Um so, I'm optimistic about the long term. I'm not optimistic about the short to medium term because number one, people have a hard time changing quickly, right? the like everybody's like oh what if we lose their jobs our our jobs it's the most important thing it's like no what what you want is not a job what you want is you know security resources to be able to provide for your kids etc um that transition maybe we can touch on that so as there's a catastrophic job loss automation replacement uh we both believe that there's a brighter future ahead but is there any plan that you've seen talked about um that you think is going to help us transition.

### 📋 セクション 146

So like like money, jobs, like what before we get to that bright future, how do we navigate that transition? >> Yeah, I think what I think one Oh, [laughter] >> not so synced after all. >> Good. >> Uh no, >> perfectly synced. >> I'm I'm curious like how in all of this future like near midterm stuff, how robotics will play out.

### ⭐ セクション 147

Um I think it's yeah it's it's interesting to consider a world where we have um like all the uh sort of white color jobs are automated but we're still then we are bottlenecked by like fine um manipulation of physical objects which humans are really good at with our hands. Uh so uh what happens then? Well, I guess humans will be employed to and mass to do these kinds of work if robotics doesn't like uh become really really good and is able to do that. That might happen, but there could be a world where humans are doing a lot of physical labor and it's actually quite valuable because it's the bottleneck in society. So, but it might also not be like the dream uh world for people who are used to sitting at a desk and uh like doing a quite chill job in front of your computer which will disappear.

### 📝 セクション 148

So yeah, I'm just that that's like one thing that I think is kind of interesting. >> Yeah, I think my biggest like short-term worry is something along the lines of um there's a blog post called the intelligence curse um by by our friends uh Luke and Rudolph and they basically say that um they draw this parallel for countries that are heavily dependent on stuff that is not human labor. So like um oil countries for example they like if if the people revolt like nothing happens because they the the the higher power of that country is not dependent on the labor the they are only dependent on the natural resources. Um and when societies start to not be dependent on the humans that they um that they are supposed to serve then there's a problem because they this incentives to serve them will diminish because they don't have the fear of revolt or whatever. Uh so like you have seen this in history that these countries are worst run like and and they are um yeah and they they don't give as good services and like to to the people.

### 💡 セクション 149

Uh so uh this is something that could happen with AI as well. When when you have uh countries that are not dependent on their people because AI is just running everything then you might have like problems with um yeah dictatorship and stuff like that. Uh and that could be very problematic in the short term. Uh what to do about that? Um >> boy good question.

### 🔧 セクション 150

I mean there is one exception to the countries which you're talking about and that's Norway right and they what's the what's the thing they did I guess they had like a strong uh democratic foundation before uh and like good uh uh citizen participation all that so that's something to just keep building on >> yeah like almost like should like oh it's almost like you can't maybe in the future you can't put an AI agent out in the world unless it like takes its rights serious to like vote on how it's being like put out into the world or something and that's the solution. I don't know. Interesting thought though. Um, my mind immediately goes to the fact that compute will at some point become like the next currency and money and asset class and just everything the most important and uh valuable thing that that people can possess. So almost as you're saying it like I'm thinking what if we tie it somehow to like if you're a unique human, right?

### 🎯 セクション 151

If you're a person, you get some distribution of compute that you can vote of how it's being used. So a government if if you know if it's not doing the right stuff, then the most of the people are like, well, we're not going to give you our share of compute or something like that where we basically tie it to some humanness like we take the most limited resource that's underlying AI and uh tie it to being a human. I I don't know. Obviously we I I don't know if we have a great plan and this is something >> okay so maybe and um we talked to e >> go go go >> no but then you get that dynamic that the government is dependent on the humans I just think that the problem with that is like it's the problem is to get to that state like if if the government doesn't want to give the compute to the people in the first place then yeah like it's it's a it's a chicken chicken and egg problem. >> Yeah.

### 💭 セクション 152

And the 1984 scenario of like this tyrannical government that is able to observe like it's funny because 1984 that book or it feels almost like a joke compared to what could happen in the future with unlimited surveillance uh you know robot police uh the government does not needing its people like I am that to me like somebody joked online I'm not worried about P Doom I'm worried about P1 1984 right that's the sort of tyrannical regime that could potentially be immortal uh immune to being overthrown and basically just locked in for I mean that's my fear uh more so than than um anything else. But yeah uh well that got pessimistic. Uh maybe something a little bit more let's leave on a positive note. Anything that we've haven't talked about that you guys want to talk about? >> We didn't talk that much about the robots but I don't know like we Is there that much to say more?

### 📌 セクション 153

They kind of failed. They were not that great. Um >> we'll keep measuring. >> Yeah. like >> we'll keep measuring them as new models come out.

### ✅ セクション 154

But yes, the the initial models weren't uh weren't that good, which is like why I brought up the robot point also. >> Yeah, it's also interesting with um there are models that are like fine-tuned to be good robotic models that we tested and they were not better at all. Uh so that's that's also interesting. Um but it's because they were trained on different types of robotic data. Um but then you would think that okay surely it generalizes a bit right uh but it didn't.

### 📚 セクション 155

So um so that's that's interesting like you're not it's not just train on robotic data and it gets better at robotic better at robotic it's like we train on that very specific thing uh in robotics and then it will get better at that specific thing. Um, this might change in the future, but like this is the the finding of our paper at least. >> You know, that does kind of feel like there's a analogy to humans though because like we, you know, we seem to be more general than some of these AIs still in some ways. But yeah, putting our brain in a different physical body would be quite a bit of time before the body could like really walk around or move or understand that form factor. >> Have you tried?

### 🔖 セクション 156

No, but I'm just imagining how, you know, I'm imagining like if you people like lose a limb or something or it just, you know, like something breaks or somebody has like a different shaped leg after a surgery or something, how long it takes them to walk. So, I was thinking maybe it could be something like that, but you know, I I don't know. I'm only speculating, just kind of thinking through it. >> Yeah. My my thing that humans are pretty good at that like like I'm not an expert but like my my intuition is that I I I think I've heard a bunch of stories of people being remark remarkably good at like recovering after losing a limp or or something like that.

### 🎨 セクション 157

>> Us also if we pick up a tennis racket or a new sport it's almost like an extension of our body and it does seem like it does kind of click in after a while. So >> all right totally wrong. Who knows? Well, and I think we're going to be discovering so much more about how the human brain works and also how it translates to like machine intelligence because certainly I remember reading a study where people that uh I believe they they lost their sight as an adult and later they found that the brain rewires to become much more sensitive to like the the the touch. So it's almost like uh our brain goes okay well we don't need the sight whatever anymore.

### 🚀 セクション 158

We're not using that. So let's get really good at um other senses. And we certainly don't have anything like that for um LMS as of yet. Uh have you seen Google's new thing, the um they just announced >> early access to their newest VLA or not? It's it's the vision action language model.

### ⚡ セクション 159

Any >> Oh, sorry. Say it again. >> No, no, I was just saying yes, you're you're right. VA, that's the that's the term. Uh >> any experiments with that yet or not yet?

### 🌟 セクション 160

We we applied for early access, but they they didn't give it to us. So, we we Yeah, if if you're listening and you're from the Google robotics team, uh please please reach out. >> Google, come on. This is [laughter] we need this. This is highly highly highly interest.

### 🎬 セクション 161

Yeah, >> we we'll get we'll we'll uh I'll uh if they if I I'll put some I'll make some noise about it. I don't know how much that's going to >> I'll be like Claude yelling into hey FBI you know fix this but um yeah you guys have been doing amazing work and I'm so happy that it's like really like uh blowing up and spreading because I think it's also combi it's it's good important work combined with great storytelling um and and I think that's very important and because it it it helps especially for me it's so much easier for me to get the stuff out there when I could tell like an interesting story about and I this through for everybody. So, it looks like you guys are going to be on Wall Street Journal. You guys are at XAI. You guys are at Anthropic.

### 📋 セクション 162

Um, and hopefully this uh radio thing is going to do really really well. Um, I guess maybe so congratulations and uh I I hope it just continues like snowballing and getting bigger and bigger. Anything else that you guys want to tell the people about what they can be doing if they're so interested in doing this? if they want to get involved whether with your company or or anything similar. Uh what can we tell people where to go and and what to do?

### ⭐ セクション 163

>> Yeah, I think one thing we want to do like we want to give a shout out to uh one of our friends that or some of our friends that are running Seldon Labs which is a AI safety uh AI safety accelerator for startups uh which I think is pretty cool. Uh so if if you're interested in that yeah intersection between startups and AI safety uh check out Seldon Labs. Um so that that's one thing. Um I think like yeah we're we're also like if you're if you're a great um um AI researcher and and want to do fun things that are getting on the front page of Wall Street Journal uh and then reach out. We're we're hiring.

### 📝 セクション 164

So that that would be also also fun. Do you have anything to add actually? >> No, I think that's great. I think yeah generally do things that are uh interesting and delightful and like funny. I think the the world needs a lot of a lot of things that are more more funny.

### 💡 セクション 165

Uh so maximize for that. >> Yeah, we we make decisions on labs based on like follow your curiosity and what would be the most fun. Um, this is partly why we chose the vending machine because it was so absurd and silly. Uh, and also the radio and that's how we're going to continue making decisions. >> Great.

### 🔧 セクション 166

>> Yeah. Phenomenally well. So, Seldon Labs, we'll link that as Seldon. That's a reference to the Foundation series, is it not? Or >> I think so.

### 🎯 セクション 167

Yeah, but you have to ask them. >> Okay. Gotcha. Oh, man. So many good things here.

### 💭 セクション 168

And I do want to make sure that we get all the links that we've mentioned so people can go and read them. the intelligence curse, Seldon Labs, everything that you guys are doing. Um, thank you so much for being here. It's been an absolute pleasure. Um, everybody that's been >> Thank you.

### 📌 セクション 169

Yes. Um, everybody that's been listening, uh, check out everything. We'll link everything down below. And, uh, yeah, keep an eye out because there's going to be a lot of things coming out of this this company, the these researchers, this lab that I think is going to be absolutely mind-blowing. So, thank you so much.

### ✅ セクション 170

And, uh, we'll see everybody next time. Be careful with multi-agent systems because they they amplify each
