## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Most people are going to probably ignore this, but OpenAI just released GPT 5.2. And honestly, this is a bigger release than GPD5 itself. It even beats Gemini 3 Pro and Opus 4.5 on many different evals. Now, GPD 5.2 is a result of OpenAI's code red. This is a initiative that Sam Alman started namely after Google released Gemini 3 where the whole OpenAI team went into this form of attack mode where they're realizing that they're losing their lead and they need to work fast with maximum urgency to stay ahead.

### 📋 背景・概要

And honestly, I would say it worked because GBD 5.2 is a surprisingly good release. Here's what Pietro said. I've been testing GBD 5.2 for a while. It's a serious leap forward in complex reasoning, math, coding, and simulations. He built a 3D graphics engine in one shot.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And GBD 5.2 2 comes in three different versions, right? We got the classic one, the default, which is what most people are going to use in CHIGBT. This is the instant version, right? GBD 5.2, but then there's GBT 5.2 thinking. This is the one with higher reasoning effort.

### 📝 詳細説明

And obviously, you have multiple options when using Enchant GBT, light, standard, extended, heavy. But then there's GBT 5.2 Pro. And this is also a huge update because most of the times OpenAI waits with the Pro version, right? They release it like two, three weeks later than the other models. But now they give us even two versions of the Pro Extended Pro.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And this is insane. I'll go into this even more later. But just as a quick sneak peek at a little taste of what this model is capable of, the juice level, aka this determines how much reasoning it has, is set to 768. This is this is unlike anything we've seen before. Models used to have 128 and maybe 256 on Pro, but look at this.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

768 on GBD5 Pro on the extended. This means that this model can think for a long long time and it will spend a lot of compute answering your questions. So if you're considering whether this $200 CH GBD plan is worth it, now is probably the best time to test it out. So in this video, we'll go over GBD 5.2, everything you need to know about it, as well as how it compares to Gemini 3 Pro and Opus 4.5. And later I'll show you how you can build anything with it live and how good it is at coding.

### 🎯 応用例

So make sure to watch until the end. And by the way, I've partnered with Gemini to do an in-person hackathon in Warso, Poland. The hackathon will take place in January of 2026, and there's going to be limited slots. So, if you want to participate, make sure to follow me on Instagram and DM me the word hackathon. First off, huge improvements in context understanding on GPT 5.2.

### 💭 考察

It has nearly perfect context retrieval for up to 256 tokens of context. Take a look at this benchmark. This is OpenAI MRCV2 for needles. This is the needle in HAG where they hide something. And look at this.

### 📌 まとめ

compared to GBD 5.0 of thinking which keep in mind this was released like what month and a half ago not that long ago and the improvement is massive right up to 256 it's like over 95% which means if you're doing long work tasks such as coding you don't have to reset to a new chat nearly as much and that is a massive improvement and same with eight needles where we can see it's not as good it's not as 95% but still it's like what 80% 75% much better than GPD 5.1 next up another unexpected improvement is in vision Right. And usually Gemini 3 was the standard because Google always made their models multimodal. But OpenAI made insane improvements here. And in fact, for screenshot understanding, it is even better than Gemini 3 Pro. And here's a clear example, right?

### ✅ 結論

So this is a motherboard. And you can see that GPD 5.1 identified a motherboard and then you know a port and USB ports. It's pretty bad, let's be honest. But then look at GPD 5.2. It identified the motherboard as the whole image and then specifically VGA port, HDMI, HDMI, USB type-C.

### 📚 追加情報

Yeah, much better image understanding. It's in fact it's not even close. So if you have some complex image you want to analyze or if you're building some, you know, vision recognition system, GBD 5.2 is a great option. And by the way, it's already available inside of open router. So if you've built your app with open router, switching to this model will take like 30 seconds.

### 🔖 補足

Another improvement is in reliability. GPT 5.2 hallucinates 30 to 40% less than GPT 5.1. Again, that's a big jump. It's not like a few%. 30 to 40%.

### 🎨 セクション 13

That's significant, right? Especially if you're building like a fact-checking system, something for schools, for education, anywhere where accuracy is super important. 30 to 40% reduction in hallucinations will be insane. So, this is from the official system card from OpenAI. And we can see that GBT 5.2 has an average hallucination rate of 0.8%.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Which brings me to the benchmarks, aka the EVALs, which are very, very impressive. Guys, don't get it twisted. People might look at this like okay GBT 5.1 5.2 this is just another small update this is not a small update this is a significant update let's take a look here we have like what eight different benchmarks from all kinds of different fields and domains of life and work so let's take a look first of all sbench pro one of the most famous benchmarks it's for software engineering right all of us care about building with AI so how does GBD 5.2 to perform well. It absolutely destroys both Gemini 3 Pro and Opus meaning right now OpenAI has the best coding model in the world. GPQA diamond this is very difficult science questions where again destroys Opus and slightly better than Gemini 3 Pro.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Carive reasoning this is scientific figure questions again the best in class even better than Gemini 3. Frontier math best-in-class Amy another math 100% saturated this benchmark best-in-class Arc AGI1 so this is a visual reasoning benchmark where again it destroyed both Opus and Gemini 3 and ARC HGI 2 which is significantly more difficult it made a massive leap right so not just a few percentage points like nearly well 15% over Opus and nearly more than 20% over Gemini 3 and by the way both Gemini 3 I'm going to show this on screen but Both Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art in these benchmarks, right? So, this is not like a benchmark that has been stagnating. No, Gemini 3 was a huge leap on this benchmark, which I covered in my Gemini 3 video, but GPT 5.2 completely crushed those results. And the same for GDP Val, which I'll get into in a bit because a lot of people don't know about this eval.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And this is one of the most important benchmarks out there and GBD 5.2 completely crushed it. Now, let's talk about coding because that's what we're all interested in and that's what the second half of the video will be about, showing you how good this model actually is at coding. So, this even beats the fine-tuned Codex models. Remember, OpenAI has a lot of different models, right? We can even see it if we quickly jump into the Codex extension.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Little sneak peek. They have the GBD 5. Codex Max, GBD 5. Codex, GBD 5. Codex Mini.

### 📋 セクション 18

These are all fine-tuned to be better than GBD 5.1 default, right? Which used to be in CH GBT. Now GBD 5.2 destroys all of these achieving 55.6% on S swbench pro and you can see in this chart how it compares to the other GBD 5.1 models the default and the fine-tuned codex max and yeah it uh wins basically on almost all context lengths. GBD 5.2 thinking is officially OpenAI's best coding model. Now when it comes to internal OpenAI testing they wanted to see how useful this model is at replacing the job of a OpenAI research engineer.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Right? Because once AI can do AI research itself, then in theory the improvement will really become super fast and will be recursively improving. So when they measured it, there was a jump, not as big as under other benchmarks, but still a big jump from GPD 5.1 to GPD 5.2 of over 10% of the amount of pull requests, right? So if you're not a developer, pull request is like a unit of work. Maybe it could be new feature, could be a bug fix, something like that.

### 📝 セクション 20

But the significant part is that now over 50% of them are replicated. So GBD 5.2 is able to replicate 55% of realw world pull requests. So this is not some like fake demo coding problem. This is the work of OpenAI employees, right? And OpenAI employees, I'm going to pop that up on screen as well, are paid very very handsomely.

### 💡 セクション 21

So these are not just like some mediocre developers. These are top researchers, top engineers. And now GBD 5.2 is able to replicate over half of their pull requests. Crazy. Next up, cyber security.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, OpenAI has the CTF benchmark, which stands for capture the flag. And this is used to test how well a model can find and exploit vulnerabilities or defense systems in realistic task based hacking scenarios. So, again, the goal is to replicate realworld scenarios, not to give it some fake easy problem for children. So, in this benchmark, GBD 5.2 again bestin-class. And by the way, the pass at 12 means did it solve the problem within 12 tries, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, this is not one shot. This is 12 tries. And if it's solved at least once during the 12 tries, it counts as a success. So when you see this on benchmarks, now you know what it means. However, now we come to the main part because GPT 5.2 is all about business, all about work, whereas GPD 5.1 was all about personality, right?

### 💭 セクション 24

And this is again it was modeled for the normies and we saw it when they made this famous example in the article of GPD 5.1 where they said, "Oh, I spilled a coffee all over myself before my meeting. Do you think everyone thought I was an idiot?" They use this as one of the main examples to show the improvements of GBD 5.1 which is absolutely ridiculous and it's clearly aimed at the mainstream users. Right? So if you run a business, pay attention because this section of the video is specifically for you. GBT 5.2 was able to match or beat professionals 70.9% of the time on business tasks.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, these are people with a certain profession, people who have a full-time job, not random people on the street, 71% of the time on business tasks at less than 1% of the cost and 11 times faster. I'm going to let that sink in. You don't have to be a genius to understand where this is going. So, if you run a business and you're still not using AI, you're falling behind. Now, here's what Ethan Moolik, a Wharton professor and an AI researcher, had to say about GPD 5.2 too and specifically the GDP val score which is the eval I hinted about in earlier section of the video.

### ✅ セクション 26

This new GDP score is a very big deal probably the most economically relevant measure of AI ability suggesting that in head-to-head competition with human experts on tasks that require 4 to 8 hours for a human to do GPT 5.2 wins 71% of the time as judged by other humans. So if you're still doubting whether AI will have effects on the productivity or growth of the economy, think again. To be more specific, let's look at sheets. This is like how many professions do some work in Excel or Google Sheets. Basically, nearly all knowledge work touch spreadsheets at a certain point.

### 📚 セクション 27

And GBD 5.2 is a huge improvement in sheets and in Excel. Right? So let's take a look at GPD 5.1. You can see that yeah it did format the columns correctly but the styling the design non-existent right it's just everything is white no highlighting nothing look at GBD 5.2 thinking clean separated spaced out looks much better and easier to overview like this is a way better product way better spreadsheet than this right so and there's a reason for that GBD 5.2 to matches the formatting of a Fortune 500 company professional, right? So, somebody who would work at a Fortune 500 company, specifically financial modeling.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, this is a financial model and these are not like jobs that are easy to do. These are six figure positions, right? So, junior investment banking analyst in New York makes between $9,000 per year to 178K per year, right? So that is a six figure salary for a junior position for somebody with the skill set of making these financial models. And guess what?

### 🎨 セクション 29

GPD 5.2 can now do a lot of these tasks. But it goes even deeper because presentations absolutely nailed. GBD 5.2 can create a professional presentation for you based on a single screenshot. And again rather than explaining that let me just show you from this real conversation that my team tested where GBT 5.2 and this was a thinking this wasn't even pro. was thinking, extended thinking, right?

### 🚀 セクション 30

So, it was this with uh extended and it fought for 19 minutes. Guys, this is how insane the juice level will be on pro. You can imagine that working for multiple hours because if GPT5.2 thinking can think for 19 minutes, you can only imagine what the pro with extended can do. Anyways, this was the screenshots of the TLA, right, of our preparation for this video. And the prompt was very simple.

### ⚡ セクション 31

generate a PowerPoint presentation based on this context. It fought for 19 minutes and then here is the result. Again, single prompt. I'm going to go through these slides one by one and you be the judge of whether you think this is a solid presentation or not. And I'm going to show you the the reasoning process because it's very interesting how it fought about creating this presentation.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, needless to say, this presentation is solid. I mean, the fact that it is from single pro is kind of crazy. I think we're becoming immune to these AI improvements even though they're they're impressive. They're like showing this to anybody just 12 months ago, they would be shocked. 24 months ago, they would think you're lying that an AI model did this.

### 🎬 セクション 33

But now we're like, oh yeah, full presentation, you know, even though this would be like multiple hours of work for a human to do and research, single prompt, that's all it takes. So if anything, GPD 5.2 proves that large language models have not hit a wall. A year ago when 03 OpenAI 03 was released, it scored 88% on ARC AGI1 at an estimated $4,500 per task. Right? So that was the API cost of 03.

### 📋 セクション 34

Today, the ARC Price Foundation has been able to verify GBD 5.2 Pro with extra high reasoning effort at a higher score, but at just $11 per task, right? So higher score and significantly cheaper which if you do the math this is a 390x efficiency improvement in one year a single year to get the same score actually a bit better score the models are 390x cheaper for that same task this is insane rate of progress absolutely incredible and if you don't know what ARGI is this is a one of the most famous AI benchmarks and it tests models on different grid puzzles that are usually visual and require require reasoning aka fluid intelligence. That's abstract reasoning and generalization. So it's not memory. This is not in the training data.

### ⭐ セクション 35

It tests how smart the model actually is. Specifically stress testing the capability and efficiency. And these are usually tests that humans can solve relatively easily but where AI struggles. And we can see that there is no slowing down on this benchmark. Right?

### 📝 セクション 36

Just uh few months ago we were like here at below 50%. Then we got Gemini 3. Then we got OBUS 4.5 and now GBT 5.2 Pro with extra high resing effort is state-of-the-art on the ARC AGI leaderboard. And this is ARGI 1, but it is also state-of-the-art on ARC AGI 2. So now you understand that this is one of the best models in the world, if not the best model in the world.

### 💡 セクション 37

So let me show you how good this model is at coding and how you can build anything with it. We will use it inside of cursor to build a working anti-hacker agent from scratch with as little prompts as possible. Now, if you think Open is finished with this release, think again because Sam Ultman himself tweeted, "We have a few little Christmas presents for you next week, meaning some updates are on the way. More Chitty stuff, more OpenAI updates are just around the corner." So, if you want to make sure you don't miss the videos when I make them, make sure to subscribe. It's completely free and it takes 2 seconds.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Just go below the video and click subscribe. With that being said, now let's get to building. So, we're going to use both cursor and codeex to test this model. First of all, let me create an empty folder. Then let me open that inside of cursor.

### 🎯 セクション 39

We're also going to use codex both the extension and the CLI. If you don't have Codex installed, I'm going to give you a massive secret. Just ask CH GBT. Tell me step by step how I can install Codex CLI on my MacBook. Browse the web answer in short.

### 💭 セクション 40

Notice that I said step by step and I specified my operating system and it gives you the steps. So just follow them. Or if you're using cursor or VS code, actually the Codex extension I think is really good. So if you go into extensions, type in Codex, you'll see this one from official OpenAI account. Install it and on the left you'll see it.

### 📌 セクション 41

Actually, I think by default it's on the right, but I moved it to the left. Doesn't matter. In the extension, you can select the model, right? So we have the old GBD 5.1s. Just make sure to select 5.2.

### ✅ セクション 42

And the reasoning effort. So we have low, which is like very fast thinking, medium, which you should use for most tasks. High and extra high. This is the new one that they added recently. And as they say, you can it can consume the limits very fast, especially if you have a plus plan.

### 📚 セクション 43

Obviously, right here, we're running on the pro account. So, I'm shilling $200 a month just for this account. So, I can show you guys the latest and greatest models, which right now GBD 5.2 Pro with extended thinking is a beast. Like, this can think for multiple hours on a single task and give you the absolute best response that AI is capable of giving. At least as of December 2025, right?

### 🔖 セクション 44

[laughter] given how fast AI is improving by next month. Who knows? Clot five, Grock 5, so many things could happen in the next 30 to 60 days in AI. And that's exactly why I created the new society, an exclusive group for people who want to be on the cutting edge of AI. So, if you're serious about AI and you want to master coding with AI, make sure to join.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It's going to be linked below the video. Now, let's get to building with GPD 5.2. So, I prepared this build idea and I'm going to start with medium reasoning effort otherwise this is going to run forever and I want to be respectful of your guys' time. So, this is a something that I warned myself for a while when I'm traveling. I don't trust these random Wi-Fi networks.

### 🚀 セクション 46

You know, you have to connect at airport, you have to connect at a hotel or Airbnb at a cafe. Sometimes it feels bad to connect to a Wi-Fi um network that you yourself don't run or you you're not sure if it's safe or not. So what we're going to do is create an AI agent that we can run from the terminal via pipex just like I have custom for example work effic tracking you know this is what I use daily it's a terminal command that I just run to track my deborg based work and wasting time I also have one for uh cleaning up MKV files from recording you can see I just run MKV cleanup and it deletes uh not deletes but puts them into trash all the MKV files so I have these lots of terminal commands that just save me time every single day and another one of these is going to be this anti-hacker agent which scans your network, loads all the data. So I'm not a cyber security expert, right? So this is something that GBD5.2 will have to figure out what are all the commands we should run to get data about this network.

### ⚡ セクション 47

You know, all the connected devices, whether it's trying to read some data from me. Then it will throw all of that into LLM. So we're going to use GPD 5.2 to power this AI agent through open router. That way we can easily switch to different models and different providers with low raising effort and give me a conclusion on how safe this network is. But it will start by asking me where I am.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So I can just say I'm at an airport. I'm in a coffee shop. I just traveled to Morocco and this network is here. So that it it uses that context to properly analyze all the data. Right?

### 🎬 セクション 49

So now it's starting and you can see that even on medium it's it's taking its time right it haven't created a single file yet. It haven't created any folders. So that's a you can imagine just how much time it will spend on thinking on extra high. That's why I set it to medium because I know that codeex see this is the both the good part about codex and the bad part. For example, if we use cloth code, cloth is obviously amazing, right?

### 📋 セクション 50

I love cloth code. I've made many videos on it. But cloth code is um is lazier than codex. Gemini 3 the same. Gemini 3 is razier.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So for example, if we use like Droid and we use Gemini 3 inside of Droid, again, a great model, a great tool, but it's not going to put in as much effort as Codex. Codex, you can say a lot of things about it. It is not lazy. It will always analyze all files. It will always put in ton of reasoning and give you a detailed answer.

### 📝 セクション 52

Even on a medium reasoning effort, right? But the problem with this is that sometimes when the things are simple, it might be best to ask cloud code when you need a small change, a quick bug or something explained. You know, you really need to know when to use what. But if you're facing a deep bug, a serious issue that you haven't been able to fix with claw code or with, you know, Gemini 3, then using codeex with extra high reasoning effort will be the way. And in fact, OpenI is really cooking with these like with squeezing reasoning to the fullest because neither cloth code like neither enthropic or neither Google deep mind are able to leverage reasoning to the high extent.

### 💡 セクション 53

Like it's not even close. Codex can run for 10 15 20 minutes no problem. I've never seen that from cloud code or from Gemini 3. But again for simple things a lot of times CEX will overthink. So that is the current uh use case and again for most most things you really should have medium.

### 🔧 セクション 54

I'm already speaking for well over a minute now and it's still running and this reasoning effort is medium. So yeah extra high is really for only this most serious bugs or risky factors stuff like that for most use cases medium or high will be more than enough especially if you're not paying for CHB Pro. Extra high is just going to waste your limits. All right. So, Clot Code gave us an answer of all the things we should care about.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Which of these could we do with terminal command/opensource libraries? Think harder answer in short. And then we're going to use cloth code to double check that GBD 5.2 is doing good work. We also probably need to get a open router API key. So, let me get that now.

### 💭 セクション 56

Boom. Open router keys. Let me create a new one. GBD 5.2. to testing.

### 📌 セクション 57

I'm going to put a limit in case I forget to delete it so you guys don't steal my credits. I'm just kidding. But yeah, I'm going to put a limit either way. Uh, what do I need to env file? Do I need to create an env code it and put it uh where it needs to be.

### ✅ セクション 58

Here is the API key. I'm breaking all security rules, guys, so do not repeat this. [laughter] But yeah, for the sake of time efficiency, I'm going to hardcode the API key in. Obviously, for your own projects, use environment variables, use env files, use secrets, properly store API keys, and do not share them with anybody. Treat them as passwords, right?

### 📚 セクション 59

I always refresh mines. Uh I delete them before uploading the video. But yeah, feel free to test it. You know, maybe I forget, maybe you get lucky. Okay.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So, uh first of all, I'm going to check the current project to ensure it is useful in this Wi-Fi pen testing scenario. Ultra think output a concise report. So, we will see what opus 4.5 thinks about the job of GBD 5 uh 5.2 and we also need to test the project. So we do that by pipex install dot and exporting the open our key uh I can't hardcode keys into repress secrets exposed are add support security store loaded from local config file in your home directory so it's refusing to do that because it's a bad security practice whatever we'll just follow the instructions so actually you know this is a prime example of like a response that's too overwhelming I would say so what I would do is I'm just going to start another cloud code boom I'm going going to move it here and I'm going to say text. Paste it in text.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Explain this text to me in a simpler and shorter way. Help me get this pex agent running. How do I actually test it here on my MacBook? Answer in short. So, it's not even close.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Cloud models are much better at explaining. They're much more Yeah, this just much easier to talk to. Okay, so let's see. What is it? There's a command line tool called net check.

### ⚡ セクション 63

All right. So, we need to run pip install pipex install from this um directory. And we're here already. So, we're going to install that. Next up, we need to export the open our API key.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So, we're going to do that. Boom. We're going to do it the proper way like it wants to. So, forget what I told you earlier, guys. We're going to do the proper security practices because um Codex wasn't happy with putting API keys into codebase.

### 🎬 セクション 65

It literally rejected that, which honestly I I don't think it should reject if the user wants it, but hey, whatever. And then let's run net check. Let's see if it works. Net check. Where are you right now?

### 📋 セクション 66

My Dubai apartment. And we might need to blur some of this. So this is a note to my editor. Hopefully it uh it doesn't link me. Okay, we're definitely blurring this.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Okay, so it asked me five different questions, but basically [clears throat] this is getting essential information from me as the user about this network. Now, it sends all of that information plus some other uh commands into GBD 5.2 and let's see the let's see the uh uh uh verdict local verdict safe risk three out of 10 key findings. Okay, so this is probably my IP address. So we might need to we might need to delete that. Recommended actions prefer HTTPS only sites.

### 📝 セクション 68

Okay. So I probably need to blur a lot of that. But basically it gave me an analysis of this. I'm going to say uh which file has the prompt we sent to open router answer in short. I need to rewrite that because the message is too long.

### 💡 セクション 69

If we make any updates, how do I reinstall this? Okay. update the system prompt to make the report a lot more concise and clear. All right, so we're gonna uninstall it and then reinstall it. Okay, so I'm going to ask Codex because again this is giving me two options and if you're beginner, you don't know which of these options are good.

### 🔧 セクション 70

So we're going to use this pipex reinstall. Boom. Clear. Okay, so let's see uh how I can run. Can I run this from global terminal just like my other commands because I don't want to run it from uh this folder from this directory every time.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Okay. So net check say net check net check. Boom. And it works. Okay.

### 💭 セクション 72

So I'm going to say Dubai. Uh uh uh I'm going to say private. I'm going to say don't want to share so I don't have to blur everything. Guys, network time. I'm do home.

### 📌 セクション 73

I'm going to use it for work. No issues. And now we're sending that to open router. And actually, if we go to open router, we should see it in activity. There it was.

### ✅ セクション 74

This is our script. Let's go back. Oh, we haven't set the API key in here. Okay, we need to do that. Okay, so I need the API key in the global environment.

### 📚 セクション 75

All right, that's good to know. Dubai private home work, no issues. Okay. So explain what the current codebase does in terms of pentesting. Ultra thinking answer in short.

### 🔖 セクション 76

So what this agent does is it does passive reconnaissance and situational awareness. So it collects network interfaces, RP table, default gateways, Wi-Fi details, as much info as it can get and plus what I tell it and puts it into the best model in the world which is GBT 5.2 2 right now and reasons about it and tells me the verdict. So there you have it. GBT 5.2 very unexpected release from OpenAI. I mean kind of expected since they released since Gemini 3 released.

It was expected they have to respond but it's unexpected how good it is and a lot of people are going to sleep on this release. And since you watch this video hopefully you realize that OpenAI is back in the game. They're not slowing down and they will put up a fight to Google. They're not going to get replaced easily. And this model is really, really good.

Especially if you do professional work with sheets, image understanding, coding, GBD 5.2, go and try it yourself. With that being said, thank you guys for watching and have a wonderful, productive week. See you.
