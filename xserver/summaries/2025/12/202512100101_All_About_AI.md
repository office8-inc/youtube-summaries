## 💡 概要

Redditから自動的に記事を取得し、Gemini AIで要約記事を生成して、リアルタイムに更新されるWebページを構築するプロジェクトです。MCPサーバーを使ってRedditからコンテンツを取得し、5分ごとに新しい記事を自動生成します。さらに、Nana Banana Proを使って画像が無い投稿には自動で画像を生成し、完全に自律的に動作するWebサイトを実現しています。AI開発者やWebアプリケーション開発に興味がある方に役立つ実践的なデモです。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **自律的な更新システム**: RedditのMCPサーバーから5分ごとに新しい投稿を取得し、Gemini 3で記事を自動生成して、Webページがハンズフリーで更新される仕組み
- **マルチメディア対応**: Reddit投稿の画像・動画を埋め込み、メディアがない場合はNana Banana Proが適切な画像を自動生成
- **柔軟なコンテンツ変更**: Claude AIに指示するだけで、対象のサブレディットやWebページのデザインを簡単に変更可能（AI動画ニュース→人間関係アドバイスへの変更例を実演）
- **リアルタイムプレビュー**: localhost:3000で動作確認でき、新しい記事が生成されると自動的にページが更新される
- **実用的な技術スタック**: Gemini 3、Nana Banana Pro、Reddit MCP Server、Node.jsを組み合わせた実践的なAI自動化の実例

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

It should auto refresh to get new posts. So, I'm just going to give it a bit of time to see if we get any new updates here. Yeah, we got it as I spoke. We got the cat with a personal trainer. So, this is a post from Singularity.

### 📋 背景・概要

We got two more articles. Perfect. And yeah, that is pretty cool. So, let's check out this cat video here. [laughter] Okay, that's pretty cool.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Okay. So today uh I wanted to kind of create like a realtime website that will autonomously update itself. So I just created like this ping uh that is not the URL that is just like ID right because of the ping. So basically how this is going to work now is that we are going to use fetch or we're going to use an MCP server in my case uh because we need some source right to write the articles for the web page. So I'm going to pull some post off Reddit every 5 minutes.

### 📝 詳細説明

We're going to use Gemini to write the articles based on those sources. And we're also going to try to pull some media from Reddit. We're going to pull images, videos that we can embed in our articles. If we don't, if the post don't have an article, we're going to use Nana Banana Pro to generate an image that will going to fit the article, right? And then we're just going to serve this uh via our API to the browser.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So the articles are going to be delivered uh to the website. And basically the idea is that this is just going to update autonomously. So yeah, this is just going to keep going autonomously. When there's like a new interesting post on Reddit, we're going to pull those. We're going to generate an article.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Basically, the idea is that this web page could run autonomously, right? That is the idea. So yeah, pretty cool project if you kind of want to get into trying some stuff. And yeah, let's just let me just show you how this work and I'm going to show you kind of a tweak we can do to make it serve other content. So the documentation I am using for this uh web page is Gemini 3 Nano Banana Pro Gemini 3 and I have my Reddit server uh because we need to fetch some content off Reddit.

### 🎯 応用例

So this is just my simple MCP server that uses my credentials to actually go fetch some content from Reddit uh subreddits we assign as you will see soon when I'm going to change that up and I just have the web app right that is basically the setup we have so if I do an uh let's say mpm start here now we can start serving this and we are doing this on localhost 3000 so you can see down here now we are processing the first post for subre Edit, Singularity, AI video, Claude AI, Accelerate. And if we head here now, refresh local host. Boom. You can see we have our first posts. And soon we should have a new one that should autonomously update.

### 💭 考察

Let's see. Yeah, here we got two more. Yeah, Claude got to be the most realistic AI ever. We brought in the image. We can go into the article.

### 📌 まとめ

And here you can see we have kind of rewritten the article based on the the post we have like and we can also click this view on Reddit. So now we go straight to the post, right? So that is pretty neat too if you wanted to do that. And we can go back here and we can check out this pro this post from Singularity. Let's see if the video works.

### ✅ 結論

Uh let's see. Yeah, I think so. Is it cropped maybe? Yeah, I think it's cropped. So, that that could be fixed.

### 📚 追加情報

Uh, but you can see we have the article here that is kind of based on the comments from Reddit and on the title. That's pretty cool. And here we have one from AI video. So, let's try to play that. Yes, this works.
