## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I get a lot of questions about people asking me about how I kind of think about creating these pipelines I usually do in my videos, reverse engineering and stuff like that. So, I thought I'd just do a simple video today where I kind of go through kind of my workflow, my thinking around stuff like that. So, if you're interested in learning about how at least I think about uh pipelines and stuff like that, we're going to take a look at a reverse engineering example you can try if you want to. So, yeah, thought this might be helpful. So, yeah, let's do it.

### 📋 背景・概要

What you see here is Opus clip. This is a very popular way to kind of take videos and turn them into smaller clips and stuff like that. So today I just wanted to walk you through kind of how we can reverse engineer this. Uh just show you the workflow and how kind of I think about doing stuff like that. So if you kind of look at the tool here, basically it's pretty straightforward.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They say one long video, 10 clips, 10 times faster or something like that. And you can see they also have like a drop video link. So the first thing I think here is uh if you wanted to do a drop a video link uh we need maybe the first thing I think about is YouTube right so we can put down I just like to do this notes so let's say download YouTube videos okay yeah I just tested this earlier so we got the autocomplete so download YouTube videos uh we can use uh ytdlp for that and we can get the YouTube video in our directory here that's kind of the first step I think about some notes I want to do here. And we also know that this clip is uploaded. Uh but we need to find out the context of the clip, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

So you can think about this is a video. So a video uh video is of course um uh MP4 and the audio is maybe MP3, right? So that is pretty helpful uh because if you want to if you want to try to do something with the video the full video so video consists of frames right and those frames can be utilized in like a project like this uh but I think economically it's better to just extract uh audio extract the audio from the video we get from the clip and transcribe it into text uh with timestamps stamps. Okay, so that is a good way to start. Now we kind of have the video, we have the transcription, we have the timestamps.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Now we know everything. And I think the next thing we need is um an LLM to look at this timestamps. Right. So if we go I think Gemini we can do yeah Gemini 3 maybe today. So basically what I want to do now is use Gemini 3 to extract uh or look at the transcript to try to do some clips from this find some interesting moments in this transcript.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

We can do use uh Gemini tree to analyze the transcription transcript and create some ideas uh around creating interesting uh clips from the longer video. Something like this. Okay. And I also like to do like a docs folder here. And let's just say uh yeah, Gemini 3.

### 🎯 応用例

Okay, Gemini 3. Here's the documentation. That's pretty good. And I think this is a good start now because now we have everything here, right? We want to use Gemini 3 to transcribe this.

### 💭 考察

And when we have the transcription and we have the we have analyzed the transcript. Uh I think we need to do something with that, right? So if you look back at obus clip, you can see one thing they do is they turn uh longer clips into vertical clips. This is something we had tried before. So I think we're going to aim for that, right?

### 📌 まとめ

And we might try to do some captions too. So now I'm just going to put that down. Uh what I want to do here. So we can do something like next step is to create a timeline JSON of the clip. Uh we want to create this should include the start and end timestamps, the text of the clip, and the type of the clip.

### ✅ 結論

So this could be like a tag. It's funny, educational, something like that. doesn't really matter too much in this step. So, basically, now that we have the timeline of the clips we want to select, this uh brings us onto the next step. That's going to be to do some processing on the original video, right?

### 📚 追加情報

And then we can do now that we have the timeline JSON, we can use ffmpeg to cut the original video into clips we want to create. So, now we just go back. We know where to cut the video and we're just going to cut this into the clip we want to use, right? And after that we have to think about more how we turn this into vertical. We can do something like we now have the 30ish second clip ffmp created.

### 🔖 補足

Now we need to turn this into a 916 vertical format from the original 169 format uh or something like that. And now I'm going to give some instructions of how I actually think about how we can use uh some other uh libraries to actually uh execute on this step. We can use something like yolo to detect the faces in the clip. Keep the coordinates of the faces and pass this to ffmpeg to crop the faces out of the clip in the 916 format. Okay.

### 🎨 セクション 13

But one thing we need to know is that we need to select who is actually talking in the c clip. So we can do something like one important thing about the faces is that we need the coordinates of the face that is talking in the clip. So we only kind of focus on the person that is actually talking, right? And then we can just do something. Now that they have all the information we need, we're going to use fmpeg to e execute on this to get the clip we selected.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And I think we're going to try one more thing and that is burned captions. And then I think I'm just going to say final thing is to burn the captions to the clip. Center center with ffmpeg 12 save as final video with caption mp4 or something like that. And that should be enough, I think, to actually reverse engineer this Opus clip. It's not going to be the same, right?

### ⚡ セクション 15

But you kind of get the idea and you can polish more on it. So now I think we can take this over to Claude code and help us do this. So let's just do Claude. And the first thing I'm going to do is basically just uh read and let's just docs or something like that. That should be fine.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And then I just want to use the notes we have created. Now I want to go into plan mode and I just want to create a plan from this. Right? So let's just head to plan mode and do from there and let's tag at notes uh create a plan to do this. Let's use uh Python something like that.

### 🎬 セクション 17

I'm not going to be too specific. So let's just try to run this. And now we're going to use the plan mode in claude code to come up with a plan. And I'm just going to speed through this. I'm going to take you back when we hopefully have a plan or maybe have some questions around this plan I can take you through.

### 📋 セクション 18

So here you can see Gemini is going to clo code is going to ask me some question. Should the user manually select the clip to create or should it auto pick? I think we're going to do a manual selection for whisper transcription local or open AI. Uh we're going to do local. Uh how should the system determine which face to track when multiple are visible?

### ⭐ セクション 19

Uh we're going to try to do speaker detection. We're going to try it. As you can see now Claude has actually done the plan. So we can go through this. Download video.

### 📝 セクション 20

Press audio. Transcribe audio. Analyze with Gemini 3 to get the clips. Display suggestions. Let the user pick.

### 💡 セクション 21

Cut selected clip. Detect faces. Identify speakers. Crop. Burn and output.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Okay. So let's try just to see now. Uh we don't know we probably have to iterate but I think this is a good start to try to recreate our reverse engineer opus clip here. Okay so we have run through the plan now and you can see we get a step-by-step instruction here. I have done all the installations and now it says run the pipeline python main.py but we need a video right.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So uh I am going to do python main.py and I found this video clip here on YouTube. Joe Rogan Nvidia Jensen Wang on trumps something something. So I'm just going to copy this link. Okay. So let's do Python main.py.

### 💭 セクション 24

Uh let's do some quotes. This let's see now. So we probably have to do some iterations. Uh but who knows maybe we're going to oneshot this. You can see we are fetching the video info.

### 📌 セクション 25

We are downloading this. Okay seems to work. That's pretty good. Uh is it stored in temporary? Okay, so we are downloading the video.

### ✅ セクション 26

That's good. So, that's pretty fast. You can see we have some temp video here. Perfect. Next step, uh, we're going to sleep a while.

### 📚 セクション 27

And then we're probably going to do the transcription. And now we did the audio. Okay, nice. Transcribing with whisper. Yes, that seems to work.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So now we're going to get the transcription from the 15minute video. Okay, that was done. Next step is to analyze this with Gemini 3. Uh hopefully this works too. So if we ran into any problems now, we're just going to have to uh go back to cloud code and report back on the issues we had.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So if you take a look at the the transcript now, it's pretty good because you can see here is start end. We have every single word here, right? So exchange this is crazy blah blah blah. So we have all the information we need, right? So now we kind of see we get some clip suggestions here.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh, we can try to do a funny clip. Uh, Trump wanted a UFC fight at the White House. That's supposed to be a funny clip. 7 seconds. What's it like when Trump texts you?

### ⚡ セクション 31

Okay. Uh, controversial. Let's just try clip number two. I don't know. So, this is just a test, right?

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, we selected clip two. Uh, okay. So, we didn't have the yolo model. We probably had to download that. Uh, okay.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, we might have to do some changes here. Okay. So, we had the iterations for now. So, I'm just going to start this again. I'm going to do the same.

### 📋 セクション 34

And yeah, let me just take you back when we actually have something here because I think everything should work now. We have the YOLO model here. So, I'm just going to take you back at the end here. Okay, great. I think we have something now.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So, you can see we completed this. And if I took this up now and I'm just going to try to play this. I'm going to turn off my microphone. Let me just fix that. >> And uh randomly get this call from Trump and he's hanging out with you.

### 📝 セクション 36

President Trump called and I called you. >> Yeah. It's just >> We were talking about you. [laughter] >> Is this talking about He was talking about the US UFC thing he was going to do in his front yard. >> Yeah.

### 💡 セクション 37

>> And he pulls out. He's JJ, look at this design. He's so proud of it. And I go, "You're gonna have a fight in the front lawn in the White House." He goes, "Yeah, yeah, you're gonna come. This is going to be awesome." And he's showing me his design, your name cast.

### 🔧 セクション 38

He, let's call him. >> It's so He's like a >> Yeah, it is working. Like, if you look at the last part here, we switch context. We go from >> I know. Let's call him.

### 🎯 セクション 39

>> It's so He's like a >> Yeah, that is pretty good, right? So, I wouldn't say it's perfect, but uh if you go back to Opus now, we kind of did everything here. We had a long video. We cut it into different parts so we could choose a clip and we turned it from a long form horrise uh hor horizontal video into vertical. I guess we missed the captions but we could have worked a bit more on that.

### 💭 セクション 40

Uh but the whole idea here does we actually did uh reverse engineer this to some degree, right? It's not perfect. This is much more polished. But uh I thought I think this just this video just what was going to be like something uh how I kind of think about if I see something it kind of brings me onto something else and I try to think about how we can actually turn this into something we could use uh by using this different AI tools. So basically uh my progress is to break it down into these notes here and then I use these notes to yeah let's say cl code for example to turn it into a plan then turn it into a product.

### 📌 セクション 41

Uh and again was this perfect? Probably not. But it if I did more polish on this uh I think we could have gotten something that was even more optimized. Uh, but like I said, the idea today just to go through kind of how I think about reverse engineering clips workflow pipelines and stuff like that. And hopefully this gave you some more directions of how you can do the same.

### ✅ セクション 42

When you see something, you read something, you think of something, uh maybe you want to reverse engineer something. And the more things you do like this, the more things you come up with stuff you can do, ideas and stuff. So yeah, that was basically what I wanted to share today. Hopefully this is helpful to someone and yeah, thank you for tuning in and I see you again tomorrow.
