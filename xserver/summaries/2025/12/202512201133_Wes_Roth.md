## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Once we encounter alien intelligence superior to ours, we might have a sense of oh and I think in in the distant future that would be the new religion in reality that is just a neighbor that happens to be much more wise and capable than we are. For us it will be a learning experience. Microbes would have survived it if they were in in the interior. So these were the first tiny astronauts. What Elon Musk wants to do going to Mars is just like going back to our childhood home if we are all Martians.

### 📋 背景・概要

What I would like to know is whether Mars developed intelligent life in the first two billion years of its history and there might be some interesting paintings in the lava tubes or the caves under the surface of Mars. I would like to go there with a video camera and check. I would argue the foundation of science is the humility to learn, not the arrogance of expertise. >> You really think you're alone in there? >> On the very day that this interview is published, something interesting is happening in space.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

The third interstellar object ever to be discovered is passing at its closest point to Earth. On this historic day, we're talking to Avi Lope. He's the head of the Galileo project, the first systematic scientific search for extraterrestrial technological artifacts. In this episode, we're going to discuss why it's very arrogant of us to assume that we're the smartest kids on the block or that we are alone in the universe. If you've ever wondered if there's intelligent life in the universe besides us, and if so, why we haven't seen any evidence of this, this interview might give you a glimpse into the reality of the situation.

### 📝 詳細説明

Let's dive in. >> Wes and I do, so sometimes we regret things. >> Have you do you have skeletons in the closet? >> It's too many. I'll Yeah, let the editor know.

### 💡 実例・デモ

>> No, no, no, no. >> Spilling out. Just kidding. I don't know. No, we're we're pretty good.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

My name is Ailob and I'm professor of science at Harvard University, the director of the institute for theory and computation uh and the head of the Galo project right now and I used to have many other leadership positions over the past decade. >> Phenomenal. Thank you so much for being here. We're we're so honored. We kind of wanted to present this to our audience lots of conversations about for example ThreeI Atlas.

### 🎯 応用例

In fact, if I'm correct, the time the release of this interview will coincide with three eye atlas passing at its uh closest point to to the Earth. Uh so I think that's kind of uh exciting. But so um I think most people who don't follow this stuff would be surprised to find out that we've observed only three interstell interstellar objects. We have the O, Muam Mua, Borisov, and now Atlas. So can we talk a little bit about that?

### 💭 考察

Why is this uh why are we only now beginning to see them? what makes them so special and kind of wherever you want to take that. >> It's like most things in science, nature is more imaginative than we are. And so for some uh relatively u simple-minded reason, we end up discovering something new. Um and in this case, it's the US Congress that tked NASA to find 90% of all objects bigger than a football field, 140 m back in 2005.

### 📌 まとめ

And uh as a result um a survey telescope called panars was established in Hawaii and it discovered a near-Earth object. Um so the the reason the congress asked NASA to do that is because such objects if they collide with earth they can cause a lot of damage. We know that dinosaurs were killed 66 million years ago by an asteroid the size of Manhattan Island. We believe that we are smarter than dinosaurs. we can protect ourselves, maybe deflect those rocks.

### ✅ 結論

So anyway, they spotted a near-earth object but realized the astronomers back on October 19th, 2017 that in fact um this one is moving too fast to be bound by gravity to the sun and it came from outside the solar system. So uh that was the first one. It was given the name Mua which means a scout in the Hawaiian language. Um and then uh it became quite uh um strange uh once more data u was collected about it because um uh it had a very extreme shape. The uh amount of sunlight reflected from it changed by a factor of 10 as it was tumbling every 8 hours and it was most likely flat like a pancake based on the variation of sunlight.

### 📚 追加情報

And uh moreover it was pushed away from the sun by some mysterious force uh without showing any evidence for gas or dust around it. So um you know it was intriguing but then by chance an amateur astronomer discovered the second object back in 2019 and um uh and then most recently there is a a survey telescope that NASA funded uh in Chile, a very small one half a meter in size called Atlas and it discovered this new object the third one 3 I Atlas I stands for interstellar 3 the third one and Atlas is the name of the telescope. that discovered it. Uh and why did we find only three? Because we were not looking for them and the these survey telescopes were not very efficient at serving the sky.

### 🔖 補足

Uh however, now we have the Reubin Observatory that was funded by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation that started operations in June this year with a 3.2 two gigapixel camera in Chile and it will survey the southern sky every four days uh and potentially find a new interstellar object every few months. So that would increase by two orders of magnitude the rate of discovery. But as I mentioned before we just found these objects by chance. In fact, together with there is a fourth object that I uh discovered with my student, former undergraduate student Aamir Siraj, where we we looked at a database on on meteors and found that one of them from 2014 that was identified by US government satellites was moving very fast. In fact, the same speed that 3A Atlas is moving um outside the solar system.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And we uh in fact called it the an interstellar meteor and I went I led an expedition to the Pacific Ocean to look for the materials of that one. So it's a new frontier and the reason it's exciting is because um even if we are talking about rocks and natural objects you know that offers us an opportunity to study the materials arriving to our backyard from a distant star and you know instead of us spending millions to billions of years traveling to other stars here we have objects that made that trip the very lengthy trip and arrived at our backyard. We we better take advantage of that. And the mainstream of the scientific community haven't yet realized this opportunity because we can check for the building blocks of life around other stars if we find a rock that arrived from our cosmic street. And um so um I see that as a very important frontier for the future because if we happen to find a technological object, we might even learn much more than from Iraq because we will realize that there is a smarter kid on the block that managed to arrive to our to us before we arrived to their backyard.

### 🚀 セクション 14

>> Absolutely. >> Yeah. Yeah. Because I would have thought that there were billions or maybe even trillions of interstellar objects. So, the whole idea when researching for this video that there's only been three or we don't do a good job detecting them kind of blew my mind.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So let me um um you know um correct that impression because if it's a rock let's say we see a rock within the orbit of the earth around the sun a rock coming on a random trajectory u the the entire volume of the solar system is a quadrillion times bigger than the volume associated with you know the orbit of the earth around the sun because the solar system goes all the way out to the or cloud which extends to a 100,000 times the earth sun separation. So this means that if you find one object let's say every year within the earth's orbit around the sun then um there should be a quadrillion of them right now within the solar system a lot. However, if it's technological it could target the inner solar system. So this extrapolation is incorrect because it doesn't reflect some random distribution. But all natural objects that are on random trajectories, you know, there are many many of them, a quadrillion of 10 to the^ 15 of them right now within the solar system, for every one that we find within the earth's orbit around the sun.

### 🌟 セクション 16

U and um that's the case for example for the abundance of objects like MUA that you know were uh are expected to have a number density of that of that much if if Omo was natural. >> Yeah. Yeah, it would be hard to rule out something like panspermia until we look at a lot of those objects to see what's on them. >> Um, yeah, this is a very interesting point cuz three atlas was recently found to spread the methan methanol, sorry, methanol. And methanol is one of the building blocks for amino acids and you know, sugars that are uh used uh for life as we know it.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And so um it's spreading much more methanol 100 times more methanol than for example hydrogen cyanide which is at large quantities is a poison for life. I mean it was used in the first world war by the US, Italy and France as poison gas as chemical weapon. Um so the good news about three Atlas is that it's spreading much more of the building block of of of life than than poison for life. And uh so you can think of it as a an interstellar gardener. So in principle you are exactly right that uh there should have been a lot of those coming through the solar system you know during its history of 4.6 billion years.

### 📋 セクション 18

And therefore it's possible that life was seeded in the solar system from outside uh potentially and that's just assuming a random process. But if there was an interstellar gardener with intelligence, you know, they could have come here just to spread the uh or or do experiments in in in the origins of life and and maybe when they were unhappy with what's coming out on Earth, they sent the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. Who knows? >> Yeah, there's a lot to think about. It's such a fascinating thing to think about that it could have come from elsewhere.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Um, now growing up reading a lot of scientific uh science fiction books, like there's this idea of a light sail traveling across vast distance in space with a light sail. Um, of course, the O Mua Mua object maybe it seemed like maybe it was operating with some sort of technology like that. Of course, recently we've also have confirmation that it's possible for us to use it. We we've had some experiments where we were able to use light sails to move a spacecraft. Can we talk a little bit about that like and and how are you using it?

### 📝 セクション 20

>> In fact, um I led the the breakthrough uh starshot project which was aiming to develop a light cell so that we can reach the nearest star uh within two decades our lifespan. And the idea was to use a very powerful laser that with a 100 gigawatt that shines on a a light sail that weighs only a few grams and carries a camera with it and so forth. And uh within a few minutes you you bring it to a fifth of the speed of light across a distance that is five times the distance to the moon. And uh such a an initiative could have launched a light sail that would have reached the nearest star system Alpha Centauri. uh during our lifespan and uh that's the only method that can work this way right now based on what we know.

### 💡 セクション 21

Uh and um so we we did um conceptualize what are the technological requirements and in principle there there are no showstoppers for this technology and of course there are many other incarnations of light sales that are using much lower speeds not a fraction of the speed of light but uh maybe uh you know a percent of a percent of the speed of light just using the push from sunlight for example and not a very powerful laser. And u what happened in the case of a muamo is that it was pushed with a force that declines inversely with distance squad from the sun. And I suggested maybe it's just the reflection of sunlight that is pushing it. It's not the rocket effect from cometary evaporation. And indeed two years um or three years later uh the same telescope in Hawaii discovered an object that was pushed by reflecting sunlight and it was given the name 2020So discovered in uh September 2020 and then within a couple of months they took a spectrum of this object and realized that its surface is made of stainless steel.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So then they figured out that it's actually a rocket booster that was launched by NASA in 1966 and it's pushed by reflecting sunlight cuz it's hollow. So here you have an example by the same discovered by the same telescope in Hawaii of a technological object that behaves in a way similar to AmuA Mua. And um uh to me it's a demonstration that you know the the training data set of uh comet experts should be expanded cuz they behave just like AI systems. They are they were trained for decades on icy rocks in the sky and they interpret any object in the sky as an icy rock. What do you expect?

### 🎯 セクション 23

Um but I'm just suggesting that I beg them to expand their training data set to include technological objects. uh because we launched such things and we know that they supplement the rocks that exist up there and and but you might say oh well we don't know they don't get confused they know what they're doing you know NASA is definitely a set of experts uh well I would argue the foundation of science is the humility to learn not the arrogance of expertise because on January 2nd this year there was a near-Earth object that was cataloged by the minor planet center, the comet experts of the world. They treated it as a near-Earth asteroid and then within a day they realized that it's moving along the path of the Tesla Roadster car that was launched by SpaceX in 2018. >> So they said, "Sorry, we take it out of the catalog. It's not a rock, it's a car, right?" And I'm saying the only reason they knew that is because they were aware of what we launched.

### 💭 セクション 24

But if someone else launched some technological object that we don't know about, they would still insist that it's either an asteroid or a comet. So when NASA says three Atlas behaves like a comet and therefore it must be a comet. If it quarks like a duck, walks like a duck, it's a duck. What do they mean by that? They mean that it sheds some dust and gas around it from its skin from its surface.

### 📌 セクション 25

Well, guess what? Any object that accumulated ice throughout its journey and some dust would shed it when it comes close to the sun. So, if you see a cloud of dust in the desert, you might argue, oh, that must be some animal making this dust and therefore, you know, it's a natural phenomena. But at the same time, it could be a car going through uh producing the same cloud of dust. And NASA would say it looks like a cloud of dust from an animal.

### ✅ セクション 26

It must be an animal. But that's not the reality of the situation cuz you can't judge a book by its cover. Okay? It's a very simple point that we need to verify because when we have a visitor to our backyard, we don't have the luxury of NASA experts being wrong. you know for the same reason that on October 7th or on September 11th you know we didn't have the luxury of the intelligence agencies being wrong they were wrong and lots of people died because of that so when you have an impact on society then the standard scientific procedure of saying at the 95% confidence I can tell you what it is well that's not good enough because a 5% probability of you being wrong and This event being of large impact on society, you know, implies that we must take that chance seriously and that's what intelligence agencies concluded after the mistakes they've made on September 11th and October 7th.

### 📚 セクション 27

So you know it's a very simple point that scientists fail to understand that when you deal with implications to society I realize most of the time scientists have no implications to I mean they deal like for example last week there were two experiments that checked for a ghost particle known as sterile nutrino. It was conjectured to exist because there were anomalies in some previous experiments. They put $90 million in these two experiments and then in Nature magazine they reported that they haven't found those signatures. This this particle does not exist. Okay.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So they were wrong. Mainstream experts arguing we should fund these two experiments for $90 million and were really believing that such a sterile nutrino may exist. They were wrong. Now this has no impact on the life of of you know just the public private citizens because e even if the sterile nutrino existed it wouldn't have any effect. So the fact that it doesn't exist doesn't mean anything.

### 🎨 セクション 29

However when dealing with a visitor to our backyard there is a chance that if this visitor you know has some intelligence to it might come through our front door. So we can't ignore that risk. >> Right. So you are in a position now where you have a company the Gal Galileo project and you have some funding. So you've got a chance to look at the future of astronomy differently.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Now it seems to me as somebody who thinks in about AI a lot, you you could start training you could be the first in the world to start training telescopes on data that would allow you to see signatures from machines. You could have um signatures from all sorts of synthetic data and anomalies that might give you a clue as to where to point the telescopes for future research. How are you using AI and technology to do things differently? >> Yeah, that's an excellent question. Um my approach um since our imagination is not necessarily as good as nature itself.

### ⚡ セクション 31

you know that uh we might if we if I were to try and imagine what might be out there then I might not actually uh include in the training data set what needs to be included and you know that in so we should not subscribe to uh the imagination of script writers in Hollywood the science fiction stories you know uh my approach is different my approach is we know the kind of objects that are either natural or humanmade okay so that includes birds, uh, airplanes, satellites, you know, uh, helicopters, planes, all the objects that we are familiar with. Um, given that we can train our machine learning software on these kinds of objects cuz, you know, they are familiar, they're around and we can of course train them on at different times of the day, different illumination levels, different angles relative to the sun and so forth. It's a very rich data set that uh needs to be studied and um and and obviously we can train them on real data because most of the objects we see in the sky are just ones that are familiar to us. Okay. And um then the only question that remains is are there any outliers and there are different ways to characterize that.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I mean um if you have a distribution of objects the way they can look like the way they can move um you are looking for things that are far in the tail. Now when you have a small number of objects then of course you don't know the probability distribution very well. You can be wrong. You know when and that's a mistake that a lot of people that go on date dates you know make because they they meet someone that someone looks exceptional but their you know their sample of the probability distribution of uh qualities of people is very limited and so they think it's exceptional. They get married with that partner only to find out that there is nothing really unusual about that partner but it's too late.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Uh and that is done very often. Okay. because you're not familiar. In order to sample the entire probability distribution, you need to go on a lot of dates. Um, and the question is how many is is enough?

### 📋 セクション 34

Well, it depends how many sigma you know how many standard deviations you want to go outside of the mean. If you are happy with the mean, just marry the first person you find. I mean, that's fine. Anyway, um so um this is important of course to sample the probability distribution and figure out what defines an outlier and how how unusual is the outlier. But it's not just about the image or the way um you know the the trajectory looks like.

### ⭐ セクション 35

It's it's more also about the speed, the acceleration, uh all kinds of features of that uh object whether it's outside the performance envelope of nonfamiliar objects. So if if we see an object moving extremely fast or accelerating very fast then we know humanmade technologies cannot make it because there are limits on the propulsion systems that we can humans use. So my approach is looking for outliers. That's what we do in the Galo project. And as of now, we have three observatories.

### 📝 セクション 36

One in Massachusetts, another one in Pennsylvania, and a third one just constructed in Las Vegas in Nevada. And um we're collecting we will collect data on millions of objects per year and look for outliers. And um if we find anything extremely unusual, obviously we will put it in a scientific paper and submit it to peer review. everyone will will be made aware of that. >> That's absolutely excellent.

### 💡 セクション 37

And and so when we're talking about trying to find these outliers or searching for stuff I mean we can look with, you know, kind of in the solar system, we can look in for maybe even for some things in the atmosphere. You know, there have been talks about various un unidentified things flying around. And of course, we can also look into very very far distances. Um, I think you had this sort of um, example or way of looking at it, like if you think about like being on a street, you have a lot of houses, you know, we might throw a rock out there, somebody might throw a rock out there. But another way of approaching it maybe to try to see if we can see any visible signs of construction across the street or down the street.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Um, you know, maybe if we spot something like a Dyson sphere or some a signature that could be like a Dyson sphere somewhere out there, that would certainly have some technological signature to it. Can we talk a bit about that? Are there any efforts to look into the far distances for that? >> Well, the there were studies trying to find evidence for Dyson spheres. And the problem is that we now know that young stars are often surrounded by debris discs.

### 🎯 セクション 39

These are still, you know, the structures that were responsible for feeding the central star with material and and there is some leftover material in those debris discs. And uh and in principle that material can scatter the starlight and appear as if there was some mega structure but it's you know that emits in the infrared but it's not really a Dyson sphere. So the the idea of the Dyson sphere is that you put the for example at the earth sun separation you put a mega structure that collects much more sunlight than the earth's surface and um and but such a thing will be impossible to hide because it will still get relatively hot roughly the surface temperature of the earth and then it will emit in the infrared. So and then you can search for such structures in the infrared. But the problem is debris discs are also expan extending across similar scales and they also produce infrared emissions.

### 💭 セクション 40

So we need to distinguish a Dyson sphere from other infrared emitters around the young stars and and and that's but there was no clear evidence for such a mega structure as of yet. Uh I should also mention that stars evolve. Okay. So even if you a civilization were to build a Dyson sphere mega structure to collect the starlight uh once the star brightens up it may break it apart and that would lead to lots of fragments in interstellar space that we can search for. And I suggested in a paper that in fact maybe moa was a broken piece of a Dyson sphere.

### 📌 セクション 41

uh because then uh you know the the simplest uh engineering approach to a Dyson sphere is to have them as light sails. Um uh the to make a a Dyson sphere out of lots of tiles that are just hovering above the star where the radiation pressure from the star keeps those tiles afloat. they are just it just balances gravity and so these these tiles are floating as if they are at zero gravity over the star and collecting starlight. Uh but then if the star for example brightens up like the sun will in a billion years it will push these tiles out of the system and maybe mua was a broken piece of such a Dyson sphere. So, so in interstellar space you might find debris from all these constructions that perhaps were uh active for a while but then got destroyed.

### ✅ セクション 42

Another risk for such a mega structure is the impact of asteroids. uh if you calculate it, you know, such a structure cannot survive more than a billion years cuz you well in a solar system like environment because there's too many rocks flying by uh in our case from the asteroid belt and they would basically puncture the structure and destroy it. I did a calculation there would be too many of them moving at a very high speed that deposits more energy than an explosive whenever they collide with with such a mega structure and eventually break it apart. So you would lose it. Um so such mega structures would exist always just for a finite amount of time and we need to be lucky to catch them when they are active and u for the same reason that we need to be lucky to get a a phone message a radio signal from a civilization which was the traditional approach for seti for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and I'm just saying um if we search for any packages in our mailbox we don't need that to know that the sender is still alive.

### 📚 セクション 43

The the sender may be dead. You know, even if we have found something in our backyard that was sent a long time ago, billions of years ago, it's still around. It's bound by gravity to the Milky Way galaxy. So, it's not running out of the Milky Way like uh radio signals are moving at the speed of light and they are lost after they cross us. So um this is a completely different approach and I believe it's more effective and I believe that we should invest as much uh research funds in searching for those physical objects um as as we invest as we plan to invest in the search for microbes because microbes as much as they uh they might be very abundant they're difficult to detect and the technological signatures might be easier to detect.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So let's hed hedge our bets and search for both. >> This is not a popular view by the way. >> Is it so is it possible to just look at the direction that something like this came from? So we have these three interstellar objects. Can you you know like in a normal world if somebody threw a snowball at you, you would turn around and say who threw that?

### 🎨 セクション 45

Can you do that? Or is it because so many things with gravity twist and pull and and push it? Is it kind of impossible to tell where 3A atlas came from? No, it's not impossible for for the reason you mentioned. It's impossible because we don't know the duration of the journey.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Okay. So, if you just trace the trajectory back in time, even if we had a perfect understanding of all the twists and turns because of gravitational deflection within the Milky Way galaxy of the object, as you go back in time, um you just don't know where its starting point was. Uh in fact the or cloud of the solar system goes halfway to the nearest star. Okay. So if the nearest star system has an or cloud then these are densely packed uh just like um billiard balls touching each other and so pick a direction and you can cross lots of or clouds around many stars along the path.

### ⚡ セクション 47

You just don't know which one it is. Uh where where did it come from? which star did it come from and what was the mechanism that ejected this object and so it's impossible I mean there were I should say that there were a lot of papers written about where these objects may have come from and um one uh approach that together with my undergraduate student um um Shakru Kakarov we we started was to trace the trajectory back in time and ask um you know if you look at the uh motion of the of the interstellar object. Uh what population of stars could it have originated from? So in the case of Omua Mua, it must have originated from a young star in the thin disc of the Milky Way galaxy because it didn't deviate much uh from that population.

### 🌟 セクション 48

But in the case of three Atlas, it's moving it was moving relatively fast com um before it entered the solar system. So it should have originated from an old star because old stars are kicked around for much longer and they acquire bigger velocities and uh based on the high speed of Fatlas before it entered the solar system. you know, it would be natural to link it to the population of old stars that are of order 5 to 10 billion years old, older than the sun. And so if you just made the rough inferences, you might say three atlas, if it's natural, originated from an old a star older than the sun. Uh, Mua Mua, the first object, originated from a star younger than the sun because it had nearly no motion uh relative to the local standard of rest of the Milky Way galaxy.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Interesting. Um, and so, you know, we've have some theories about where life maybe could have originated. Um, if it wasn't on Earth, it maybe it came from maybe Mars. potentially Mars had some sort of uh life at some point and eventually, you know, it it extinguished there. We have life here.

### 📋 セクション 50

Potentially maybe it was uh transferred from Mars to here. That's that's one of the possible hypotheses. There's certainly it seems like there's some structures on Mars that are a little bit too geometric, a little bit too precise to be maybe natural. Can we talk about that a little bit? Like do do you view that as a possibility that there was a civilization or at least life on Mars at some point?

### ⭐ セクション 51

And uh yeah, anything about that? >> Yeah, I mean I was asked this question by Joe Rogan a month ago and um the evidence is not at all clear. I mean um it could be that we are looking at rocks with some unusual shapes and obviously Mars was bombarded by uh rocks from uh other from far away you know not originated on on Mars and it's just a museum that preserved those rocks because it over the past two billion years it didn't have an atmosphere. So on earth when a rock of uh less than a meter uh enters the atmosphere it burns up in a fireball because of the friction with air. But uh over the past 2 billion years all the rocks that impact all the objects that impacted Mars did not burn up in an atmosphere.

### 📝 セクション 52

They just collided with the surface and you could find them there. So that implies that Mars is a a museum that collected um all the objects and we just need to to do some archaeological digs there or or survey the land and see if there are any unusual objects that could include natural rocks from the solar system or from interstellar space but also potentially technological objects. uh and um I think it's a very interesting um uh study to to to make and I would also be curious to go into the caves on Mars because in the first two billion years of its lifespan uh it had an atmosphere it had liquid water in the form of lakes, rivers and oceans just like Earth and in fact it cooled before Earth did. So, uh, life should have started on Mars before it started on Earth. And maybe it was transferred to Earth through rocks that came from Mars because there was a heavy bombardment by rocks uh, in the first hundreds of millions of years.

### 💡 セクション 53

And um, that could have chipped the rocks from the surface of Mars that may have had life first and and brought them to Earth. And in in that case the all these microbes that managed to survive in the interiors of rocks because the rock itself didn't heat too much. We have one example where it didn't heat more than 40° C. A Martian rock that was studied about 45 years ago uh was inferred to to not have suffered very extreme heating and microbes would have survived it if they were in in the interior. So these were the first tiny astronauts and what Elon Musk wants to do going to Mars is just like in that case would be just like going back to our childhood home if if if we are all Martians.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Um but um uh what I would like to know is whether Mars developed intelligent life in the first two billion years of its history and it's just a factor of two faster than Earth. uh there is nothing to forbid it from doing that just twice as fast as earth. Uh and in that case there might be some interesting paintings in the lava tubes or the caves under the surface of Mars. I would like to go there with a video camera and check uh and uh it could be really interesting. Uh, of course it was likely there was very likely life in primitive form on Mars as soon as it cooled just like it it happened on Earth.

### 🎯 セクション 55

>> Wow. Space archaeology. That's a great job for somebody who's born today to build their life around. >> Yes. >> Um, let's talk about the Firmeny paradox.

### 💭 セクション 56

So that's the question that asks um is the universe like if the universe is so old why don't we see any evidence of intelligent life out there like what's your what's your take on the firmy paradox >> well um I I think it was quite unfortunate and Rico Fermy who was an experimental physicist asked the question this way back in 1950 while having lunch at Los Alamos and if I were there I would put my arm around his shoulder and said Enrico, you're not that attractive. Uh, you know, that's a question that every lonely person asks. And what you tell a lonely person is, you know, you should be more proactive. You should go to dating sites. Don't expect your partner to show up at lunch in Los Alamos when you're asking this question.

### 📌 セクション 57

Uh, that's what you tell your friends when they don't have a partner. Uh, they usually say, "There is nobody for me." But they they're not searching actively. uh and Rico Fermy didn't build a telescope, didn't uh study interstellar objects uh and I you know we didn't invest a lot of funds so far in in fact we found those interstellar objects by chance. So my point is once we invest billions of dollars, let's say $10 billion in this study and not find anything, we would be exactly at the same point as the search for dark matter is dark. Most of the matter in the universe uh is of some unknown form and we don't know what it is.

### ✅ セクション 58

It's sort of like a blind date. You don't know what you will find and um we've been searching for decades, invested more than $10 billion in the study, haven't found anything. Okay, but at least we tried. So we ruled out some possibilities. Um, but if someone would have asked just like at the time of Enrio Fermy, you know, where is the uh sterile nutrino?

### 📚 セクション 59

Where is the axion? Where is the weekly interacting massive particle? I don't see any evidence for it. You would tell that person, of course, you can't see evidence for it because you didn't put the billions of dollars in the in the search. But somehow in the context of aliens, it's completely folklore to say we haven't seen anything and you know extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

### 🔖 セクション 60

There is no extraordinary evidence. Therefore, they no money should be allocated to the search. It's it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you don't seek something, you will not find it. And you can maintain your ignorance by not looking through the telescopes.

### 🎨 セクション 61

That's exactly the approach that the Vatican had when they argued that Galileo should be put in house arrest. They not only were upset that Galileo looked through his telescope for the first time and found evidence that Earth is not at the center of the universe, but they banned uh the dissemination of this information and did not want to look through the telescope. That's an active erh you know uh approach to uh maintaining your ignorance. They basically wanted to remain ignorant about the data that you can get from a telescope. Why?

### 🚀 セクション 62

Because it violated their prejudice. Okay. So those people who say no funding should be allocated to the search for technological signatures, they want to maintain our ignorance. Look at it that way. Because if they were really curious and open-minded, they would say, "Let's put a few billion dollars in that search." The same way we are searching for dark matter or the same way we are searching for microbes, let's just do the same thing for a very fundamental question that everyone is curious about.

### ⚡ セクション 63

The public cares a lot about, let's put also a few billion dollars in that direction. No, no, we will not put that because it's an extraordinary claim. Well, what about the extraordinary claim about the sterile nutrino which happened to be wrong? What about the extraonary claim about super symmetry which happened to be wrong? There are lots of mistakes that the mainstream of science made where we didn't find what we were seeking and that's after investing the billions of dollars.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So I'm saying you are not allowed to ask Fermy's question until you put the billions of dollars in that direction. It's a question of the order. Okay? First you put money into the search. So if if you are a lonely person, first you go to dating sites, you look for people.

### 🎬 セクション 65

If you don't find anyone, you can then make the case that you are alone. >> Absolutely. And that's an important point to make. I think the the quote and yet it moves by Galileo as he's uh leave leaving the Vatican after being threatened to not talk about it potentially being burned at the stake. You know, still has the courage to say and yet it moves kind of in opposition to this force.

### 📋 セクション 66

Uh that's one of my favorite quotes. I think uh definitely uh it's it's up there. H you know now we know that the earth was moving around the sun 4.6 billion times 4.6 just keep in mind 4.6 billion times before the Vatican even existed. Then the Vatican comes along on this earth that was moving 4.6 billion times and says no no no it's the sun moving around the who cares like in the cosmic scheme of things humans can make mistakes all the time. You know all these critics who say we don't have a neighbor.

### ⭐ セクション 67

There is no extraordinary evidence for that. Who cares if the neighbor exists. You know it doesn't really matter how ignorant we are. We can stay ignorant. We can avoid the investing in this search and we just will not know the truth.

### 📝 セクション 68

But the reality of the matter will not change just because people say that it's an extraordinary claim. And let me ask you this because you see this um I mean everywhere of course this idea that people tend to stick to their groups. They they care about other people's opinions that are that they respect. Um and it it feels like maybe it should it probably happens in scientific communities less because scientists are trained to be more logical and but it still happens a little bit. We want to be liked.

### 💡 セクション 69

We want to be respected. No, >> I would say it's not happening less because I'll give you an example. uh the mainstream of theoretical physics. You might say this is the you know the frontier that is advancing what we know about the physical reality. Physical reality that's what physics is all about.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Right? The mainstream community of theoretical physics over the past half a century was advocating the notion of extra dimensions in the context of string theory. Not only they didn't that the this approach of of extra dimension string theory did not lead to an experimental test. It didn't lead to a prediction that can be tested in principle. There is no experiment planned for the next century that will test string theory.

### 🎯 セクション 71

And if you were to ask a string theorist what is your prediction? They would say string theory must be right. Uh it's only some conjectures that I can make. That may be wrong. In fact, this is a direct quote from one of the leading practitioners of string theory two weeks ago at after a talk that he gave at the institute for theory and computation for which I serve as director.

### 💭 セクション 72

So I asked him you're making a prediction right now and uh that's great about cosmology. He made some prediction and I said that's great. So if we go out and test this prediction would it prove that string theory is wrong? and he said no string theory must be right it's only my conjecture so you can't do that in science you have to stick your neck you have to say okay this is a prediction that I make and if it turns out to be falsified then my uh you know idea must have been my theory must have been wrong no but in this case if you prove it wrong no string theory is still okay so then how can you claim victory if it happens to line up with future experiment so this is a whole culture that for half a century basically was mathematical ical gymnastics and it doesn't there are many versions of the theory we don't know which one is correct so there is no prediction when you ask about specific examples like what happened before the big bang what is inside a black hole they say it's too complicated they cannot make a prediction so this is the mainstream that claims to lead the frontier of physics according to Brian Green >> okay just look at Brian Green Every other week he talks about string theory being at the frontier. But it's already 50 years.

### 📌 セクション 73

We haven't seen any prediction that is tested or will be tested in the coming century. And what are we talking about that supposed to describe the physical reality? So the question is is this really the mainstream that we should believe? Uh, is this really not speculative? Uh, much less speculative than saying that something like us exists near another star or existed for billions of years before us.

### ✅ セクション 74

After all, that that is a matter of common sense. If you see a 100 billion stars, most of which formed billions of years before the sun. Okay, most of the stars we know formed billions of years before the sun. Takes less than a billion years for the Voyager spacecraft to cross the entire Milky Way galaxy. There was plenty of time even for the technologies we used in the 1970s.

### 📚 セクション 75

Voyager even for that technology takes less time to cross the Milky Way galaxy than the time difference between the formation of more stars, you know, relative to the sun. There was plenty of time for them to arrive at our backyard. And for some reason, the possibility that we might find a technological relic is highly controversial. And people keep attacking me even personally just by proposing to leave it on the table as a possibility. And you ask yourself, how is that reasonable that extra dimensions string theory for 50 years is able, you know, and of course the answer is those critics that attack me, they say nothing about string theory because there is a whole community there.

### 🔖 セクション 76

And what is the power of a community? It's just like a religion or a cult where you don't need experimental verification. And anyone that deviates from the herd you know is immediately attacked or sidelined or ridic or or you know marginalized and they have their own set of belief and they have their own criteria for uh you know what is impressive what is not. It's based on some intellectual gymnastics and and some mathematical uh virtuosity and things like that. They have nothing to do with the physical reality.

### 🎨 セクション 77

And so the fact that you can have this construction of a community that dominates the mainstream of theoretical physics for half a century within science, you know, makes you wonder if there is anything different between the social forces within science and what you find in religious cults. Because I'll give you an example. Um the there is the Lubavich community in Brooklyn. You might be familiar with it. uh and they h believed that their rabbi will become the messiah after he died and and then he died and he didn't come back as the messiah.

### 🚀 セクション 78

So what did they say? We just have to wait. >> There was no way for this theory to be falsified. And I'm asking if there is no way for a religious belief to be falsified. What is the difference between science and you know a belief system?

### ⚡ セクション 79

The main difference is you you should you know you should put the the head of a theory under the guillotin of experimental verification because only when you you know the experimental verification chops the head of the theory then you know that this theory is wrong and then you move on to some other theory and that's the way science makes progress. You know learning is is done through making mistakes and eventually figuring out what's right. But if we don't have feedback from experiments we can't do that. So it's not just a nuance that you can say okay for the next century forget about experiments let's just think about what whatever we want to imagine. No it's a very substantial point that that without this ingredient we can't make progress.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Okay. So if you are taking away the most essential aspect of doing physics and you are claiming to represent physics, sorry, you are misrepresenting physics because you are supposed to, you know, uh uh put the theory under the the standard procedure of experimental verification for it to become a physical theory and not a mathematical theory. >> Right. Well, and I mean at least maybe misery loves company. This is a problem that you see across the entire world.

### 🎬 セクション 81

world. I mean, how many politicians have said, "Just give me this money and I'll fix the problem." And they don't. And they say, "I need more money to keep working on it." And it just goes on forever. So, >> yes. >> Um, yeah, it's definitely, >> you know, I I completely disagree that this that science is doing better than than politics or or or religion.

### 📋 セクション 82

Uh, I think we have the same issues across the board. And um for us uh to make progress we need to hold you know the practitioners uh responsible for for what what they're doing. You know we we can't just let everyone be loose and do whatever they want because that's you know the definition of this profession is such that you need to verify ideas by experiments that there is no way I mean otherwise it's not it's not physical science. >> Okay. So one thing I just I just always had this uh just want to always say to the people listening, you got to you got to support the heretics.

### ⭐ セクション 83

You got to support your local heretics. The people that speak out against kind of the orthodox things. It is important that we have those people that are okay with being cancelled or not being liked by the community that they still are allowed to speak because very often they're the ones that end up being right and then of course later we're like of course they were right all along. So just just kind of throwing that out there. But >> well let me just explain that I'm not a heretic.

### 📝 セクション 84

I was in lead I'm in leadership positions. I I was chair of the astronomy department for nine years. I chair the board on physics and astronomy uh of the national academy. So I know what I'm speaking. I I I'm coming from the same culture.

### 💡 セクション 85

I'm just speaking out what seems to me like common sense. And the fact that it doesn't line up with what some other people are saying, you know, you can evaluate for yourself what makes more sense to you because common sense is not always common in academia. >> Sure. I meant more like Galileo, like somebody that at the time there were like we need to shut this man down. We need to he can't talk.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Let's burn with the steak. And >> but you might you might say you might say, okay, that's a history, but since then we evolved. Now we have science and then you glorify science. I'm just saying you can't do that because just look around at the practitioners of science and whenever they misperform, you should you should speak out. >> Yeah.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Well, and it's it's just so hard to get somebody to believe something when their paycheck depends on them not believing it, too. So if you had unlimited resources and let's say we could get past this sort of political cultural issue with money both in science politics and everything how how should we spend the money like what would you do and how would people hold you accountable if you uh didn't accomplish your mission >> right so my first of all the most important aspect of you know the physical sciences is experimental verification okay so I would cultivate the culture I mean put the entire culture should be centered on checking, you know, being guided by experiments just, you know, that's the way that quantum mechanics was discovered. We didn't imagine it to be that that way. And in fact, Einstein had problems understanding it. So for us to to fool ourselves that we can figure out how to unify quantum mechanics and gravity just by pure thought is not not is really arrogant.

### 💭 セクション 88

And I do think we should for example in the context of unifying quantum mechanics and gravity we should find experimental pathways to unraveling what you know how to do that because quantum mechanics itself was not anticipated. But in in in the context of doing that you know we should always think outside the box and cultivate uh innovation. And the way to do that is encourage people uh to deviate from the doctrine from the beaten path. And the way to do that is reward them if they open new pathways rather than punish them. And what happens right now is there are all these echo chambers of people who advocate you know maintaining the views we had traditionally and they just because that way we don't make progress and we keep staying in the same place you know and so how do you cultivate a culture of innovation you reward you give grants to people who are opening new or at least trying to open new pathways uh to knowledge and you know if they fail of course I mean it's just like invest investing uh um you you might invest a certain fraction of your funds in in bonds and some in stocks you know and um so um you can then have a diversified portfolio where you don't lose all the money but at the same time you might actually have great benefits from the risky investments uh and even if a small fraction of them uh turns out to be uh beneficial then they might pay for everything else.

### 📌 セクション 89

That's the way I see it. And I I actually wrote 13 years ago or 14 years ago, I published a a a an essay, an opinion essay in Nature magazine about that. uh and and so I think it's just a question of uh diversifying our portfolio and investing a fraction of our research funds in the direction of risky propositions that are not um you know are not accepted this the the mainstream approach to solving the problems we have um and perhaps one of them will will actually provide us with a breakthrough that that we need to to move on uh I think that's What's missing with the current funding system which is centered around selection committees that are uh filled with uh people that have um uh all these um echo chambers and and and they keep doing the same thing they were doing giving it to friends that are doing the same thing and uh it just doesn't bring us closer to to the truth. >> Yeah. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 90

And of course, Jeffrey Hinton, the godfather of AI, I mean, for a a while there, he was going against the crowd, the consensus in talking about neural nets. Yeah. And now, of course, everything that we're seeing, this massive buildout, all this AI craziness is as partly a big part thanks to him going, "Nope, this is going to work. This is going to work. This is going to work." You know, and here we are.

### 📚 セクション 91

>> Just just look a century ago at quantum mechanics. The foundation of quantum mechanics was worked out by Neils Boore. I actually visited Copenhagen and I really wanted to go back in time 95 years just to the same place and and speak to all these luminaries that founded quantum. Albert Einstein was arguing with Bourne and said in saying that no no no it it's still similar to classical physics and there couldn't be spooky action to this and Bore was quite courageous. He said, "No, no, it's a new way to think about the physical reality." And he was right.

### 🔖 セクション 92

And now all the gadgets that we use, including AI, are based on on quantum mechanics. So, as you say, uh when you open up a new understanding of reality, it it's the foundation for future technologies. It it will definitely have applications that will be beneficial to society. And we just have to focus on innovation. I I think much more than on repeating the mantras of past knowledge.

### 🎨 セクション 93

>> Yeah. Well, the the whole idea that you talk about with cosmic mod modesty is something that resonates with me. I mean, modesty in general across the board is something we need more of and in our space where Wes and I are watching intelligence um sort of transform day by day with many different architectures and def definitely def different modalities. It's like we have to have some sort of intelligent modesty also like the human brain is probably not the pinnacle of all intelligence. >> Exactly.

### 🚀 セクション 94

>> Even though it feels that way. >> Yeah. So I think we are about to discover that we're not at the top of the food chain. And there could be two reasons for that. One artificial intelligence our own kid may be smarter than us.

### ⚡ セクション 95

It's just like you give birth to a child and child happens to be better than you. That happens to many of us. um and um this is a technological kid that we gave birth to and might supersede our cognitive abilities. We might not recognize it at first and maybe already it does and uh on some in some aspects it it may be like a genius that you know in some practical aspects we can still do better and we can be proud of that but in some other aspects it's already beyond us. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 96

So um that is uh one type of AI that we are we will face in the near future and uh the second uh type of AI is alien intelligence and that could be even more overwhelming. Uh and that's what I'm trying to find. Uh and you know there is of course a question of language of how to communicate if we do find alien intelligence that is superior to ours or whether they even care about us. We we tend to think that anyone coming to the solar system is doing it because they want to visit us, you know, just like in Rico Fermy. Where are they?

### 🎬 セクション 97

Like why aren't they showing up at at Los Alamos? Like like who cares about you? Who cares about >> Nobody wants to date you, bro. >> Yeah. Like why is that such an important goal for aliens to visit you at all?

### 📋 セクション 98

Like the Earth is just a tiny rock, three parts in a million of the sun that left over from the formation of the sun. the bigger uh player in the solar system is Jupiter and if anyone would come you know would embark on a journey of that takes a billion years uh they might target Jupiter not earth you know it's not clear what their goal would be so um altogether I think it will bring us to a sense of humility that we we never had before and it may be a substitute to traditional religions that envision the superhuman entity in the in the name of God. Okay. So even for secular people that do not believe in God like NZ said in in 1882 he said that God is dead. Uh once we encounter alien intelligence superior to ours um we might have a sense of oh that is similar to traditional religions.

### ⭐ セクション 99

And I think in the in in in the distant future that would be sort of the new religion where there would be something in reality that is just a neighbor that happens to be much uh more wise and capable than we are. You can think of it as a sibling of our family of intelligent civilizations uh that happens to be more accomplished than we are. Maybe because they had more time to develop science and technology. Doesn't matter. For us it will be a learning experience.

### 📝 セクション 100

And you know the then we look back and at all these critics who say oh it's an extraordinary it would look completely ridiculous like a bunch of of monkeys on a planet saying oh we are the strong you know like we are at the top of the food chain and then not realizing just like the church didn't realize that the earth moves around the sun not realizing that you are just a drop in the bucket and there is much more out there that is far more accomplished than we are. And I think that would bring humanity to a better place recognizing that. >> Absolutely. That's very well said. >> You know, I I don't know if you're doing it, but it seems to me like if I was you, I'd probably be trying my best to sit down with people like Demis Hassabus and Sam Alman or at least as close to those people as you can get inside their companies to see how you could use AI to expand your search.

### 💡 セクション 101

>> I would love to do that. Uh um I would love to do that. >> Yes, >> absolutely. And we have to be respectful of your time. I know you have to go.

### 🔧 セクション 102

So, thank you so much for giving us this time. This was absolutely amazing. Just one last quick question, maybe 10 second question. You know, assuming there is some sort of bio signature, techn techno signature out there that shows that there's something else out there. Do you believe that it's just it's out there?

### 🎯 セクション 103

We're just not seeing it yet. Is that your kind of like, okay, that's and you know, if it's not out there, then of course I will not find anything, but I think we should give it a try because it might be out there. And usually in life, you know, uh it's important to be an optimist because sometimes life is a self-fulfilling prophecy. So if you're not seeking a partner because you said it doesn't exist, you will never find it. But if it exists, you might find it.

### 💭 セクション 104

So um I >> imagine how different the world would be if we all like if people just the culture was we believe in aliens and we put so much resource into it and we believe they're out there. We'd probably still say we need more time. There's it's a huge universe out there. We want to be depressed that we're lonely. It's an interesting >> Right.

### 📌 セクション 105

Right. And you know, it takes time for for us to make discoveries. You know, it's already almost a century since we found there is dark matter. We don't know what it is. So, we should be patient, but invest resources in the search.

### ✅ セクション 106

That's key for us to learn something new. And um yeah um at any event um my next commitment is uh to a forum called state of the world 2025 which is very fitting to what we just discussed. >> I'm glad we can warm you up. >> Thank you so much. Very optimistic, very fascinating.

### 📚 セクション 107

Thank you so much. Good luck to you in all your endeavors and uh to the listener. Uh thank you so much for watching. We'll see you in the next one.
