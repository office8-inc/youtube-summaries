## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This is what we are going to build today. It's going to be a podcast anythingiting app. Okay. So, let me just walk you quickly through how this is going to work. Uh the user can upload a document.

### 📋 背景・概要

This could be a PDF markdown text file. We're going to send this over to Gemini 3. And here we are going to use Gemini 3 to create a podcast script. And we want the app to be like a podcast editing. And for that we're going to use multispech.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh but we also want to be able to set some parameters in the app. This could be how long it's going to be. Is it going to be a style of a roasting the context? Steelman strawman the context. Explain it like a fifth grader.

### 📝 詳細説明

And basically what the Gemini is going to do is going to write the script for the multispech. We're going to send this to the multispech API from also Gemini. And what you get back is a podcast episode. And this has like two different speakers as you will see soon. And I think it works out pretty good.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And then you can just download your episode. you can listen to it wherever you want. So, basically that is the app I'm going to do today. So, uh yeah, let's just get started. I'm going to show you a few things we need up front and then we can just go into cloud code and build this.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, the context we want for this is uh some context from Gemini. We want the audio context. We want the multispech context. And we want the Gemini 3 uh yeah text uh context and yeah the documents so we can understand documents and all of this documentation you can find on the Gemini API um yeah page docs page Gemini API docs and you can find all the context you need here. So yeah here you can see the document understanding.

### 🎯 応用例

I just copy this, pasted it into my markdown file here in docs in my own folder. I have the Gemini API key. Uh I also have a test script here. I just wanted to see if it worked. That is just a simple test script.

### 💭 考察

And that is basically my whole setup uh before we get into claude. So yeah, we have the context, we have the ID, now we just got to build it. So like yesterday, we start here uh in the terminal. I'm just going to go into claude in the directory I'm in. And again, I'm going to switch to plan mode like we did yesterday because I want Opus 4.5 to generate a plan for me.

### 📌 まとめ

So now I'm going just going to explain the ID uh to Claude and then I'm just going to yeah bring you back when I have the plan. Okay, so I explained the full ID here now to Claude Max using my text to speech. I thought I could just skip this in the video because it's just such a long rant. So basically, if you want to read the full prompt, I gave it in here. You can just pause the video and just read what I said to it here using my text to speech.

### ✅ 結論

So what's going to happen now is that uh we have started now looking into the plan. So you can see we have these three explore agents and I'm just going to let this run and I'll take you back when we have the plan. Okay, great. That was done. Now we have the plan right and I kind of read through this and it seems pretty strong.

### 📚 追加情報

We have the TTS back end. We're going to keep this as Python and we're going to do kind of a Nex.js more style front end. We have our voices. We have our styles and the length is going to be we have a uh length here. So 2 to four, four to six, six to eight, something like that.

### 🔖 補足

Uh you can always iterate on this and we have the two voices. Uh and we have the the prompts for the write a comedic roast style podcast, right? And of course it's going to use the context we put in. And I just I think this looks good, right? Uh we might do some iteration at the end, but we'll see.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And we kind of have the everything here. So yeah, I think that looks pretty good. So yeah, I'm just going to ahead go ahead start this. So now we are back out from plan mode. We're just going to run through this and see if we can build up.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Okay, so that was done. So now kind of the agent has run through everything, right? You can see uh here we have the podcast editing. We have the structure, the features, and I open this in my local host here. Boom, we got it.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So here we can just upload our file. So, I I actually did I grabbed kind of my I guess I could show you this my just a few lines from my credit card statement, right? And I just wanted to see if we can roast this. Okay. So, let's just upload our credit card statement.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And okay, so you can see now we get the UI. We can pick roast explain steelman strawman. I'm going to do roast two to four minutes and hit generate. And if you scroll down here now, you can see we have this nice timeline. And now we're just going to wait to yeah, we are generating the audio and hopefully we can also play this now in this uh window here.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So yeah, let's just let this complete and I'll take you back and let's listen to kind of the result here. Yeah, we got it. So you can see your podcast is ready. We have the option to download and let's listen to one minute. Okay, so we're going to do one minute of each and we're going to do three examples.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, I'm just going to play this now and yeah, I guess you can just listen. >> All right, Sarah, let's dive into the financial abyss, shall we? This month's credit card statement looks like a Viking raid on my bank account. >> Oh, boy. Where do we even start with this masterpiece of modern spending?

### ⭐ セクション 19

It's like a travel brochure for Norway sponsored by Apple. >> Exactly. We've got apple.com bill twice. Are they charging me extra for the existential dread their products induce? >> And then there's many Norway and Remma 1000 Norway.

### 📝 セクション 20

You were definitely eating well or at least attempting to. >> I was experiencing Norwegian culture. Sarah, which apparently involves overpriced groceries and questionable fermented fish. >> Okay. But then there's Herz Norway.

### 💡 セクション 21

Frank, you didn't buy a whole Herz franchise, did you? No, it's a rental car. Though, honestly, given the total, buying the franchise might have been cheaper in the long run. >> Followed closely by be. >> Okay, so I guess it tried to be humorous here.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Did it make it? I'm not quite sure. Uh, but it did work. That's what I wanted to see. Okay, so yeah, pretty cool.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Uh, let's try something else. So, I found this um I found this uh bench uh bench butter bench paper here. So this is evaluating LLM controlled robots for practical intelligence. I downloaded this. So uh let's do create another and let's upload this PDF file.

### 💭 セクション 24

Okay. Butterbench. Uh I guess we need to Yeah, let's see if this actually works. I'm not quite sure. Let's try it out and see if we can get this to work.

### 📌 セクション 25

Yeah, we got there in the end. It just had to kind of upload this. So this was 4 megaby, so it took some time. So here I going to think we're going to do simple explanations for everyone. I think that's a good idea here.

### ✅ セクション 26

And again, let's just do the two to four minutes because yeah, I guess we could also make it longer, but just for the sake of this, let's just do the shortest version. So yeah, I'm just going to again generate this and let's listen to uh explain it like a fifth grader about the butter bench bench uh paper. So again, let's just do the same. Uh, I'm going to play uh about a minute of it and yeah, let's see how this turned out. >> Hey everyone, welcome back to the show.

### 📚 セクション 27

>> Today we're diving into something really cool. Robot butlers. >> Not quite Rosie from the Jetsons, but we're talking about robots controlled by AI to help us with everyday tasks. >> Sounds futuristic, but what tasks exactly? >> Well, researchers at Andon Labs created a benchmark called Butterbench.

### 🔖 セクション 28

It's all about testing how well these AI powered robots can handle practical intelligence. >> Practical intelligence, what's that in robot terms? >> Think about it like this. Analytical intelligence is solving a math problem. Practical intelligence is figuring out how to navigate a crowded room to grab a snack.

### 🎨 セクション 29

>> Ah, so it's about dealing with the real messy world. >> Exactly. Butterbench tests things like finding a package, figuring out if it needs refrigeration, and even noticing if someone's moved from where they're supposed to be. >> Yeah. Again, uh I think this works pretty good.

### 🚀 セクション 30

We did follow the instructions to do a simpler explanation for this. So, you can hear that in the example. Uh yeah, I might listen to the full thing, but for now, we just going to keep it like this. So, the explain it like your five from the better bench paper worked. I like that.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Uh I want to find one more example so we can also test out the steelman versus straw man debate. I'm just going to find some article I think. Okay. So I have this article here. Antropic CEO weighs in on the AI bubble talk and risk taking among competitors.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So this is Dario Amade. Yeah. Having a talk. Uh so we have this article. So let's head over here and let's do article.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Okay. And we're going to do the steelman versus straw man again. Let's do 224 and generate. And yeah, uh let's hear uh if you can actually follow the prompt here and we get this back and forward arguments. >> Welcome back to the podcast everyone.

### 📋 セクション 34

Today we're diving into some recent comments from Anthropics CEO Dario Amod about the AI industry. >> Specifically whether or not it's all one big overhyped bubble or at least that's what I'm hearing from the news. >> Well, Amod's take is a little more nuanced. The core argument is that while AI has incredible potential, some companies are taking unwise risks regarding infrastructure investments and that could lead to trouble. Let me lay out the strongest version of this.

### ⭐ セクション 35

>> Okay, hit me with it. >> The most compelling argument is that the rapid growth of AI creates a significant dilemma. Companies need massive computing power, meaning they must invest heavily in data centers. However, the economic payoff timeline for AI is still uncertain. >> So, what's the problem?

### 📝 セクション 36

Just build more data centers. It's the future, right? >> That's the straw man. The problem is the timing. Investing in all that infrastructure.

### 💡 セクション 37

>> Maybe not 100% what I wanted. I wanted to uh if I redid this prompt, I think I wanted one host to do the steelman argument uh for this article like pro and I wanted to do the straw man argument kind of against this or maybe not a straw man I guess some kind of uh yeah but I guess it worked out fine. Uh so I'm pretty happy with this and overall again super smooth workflow using cloud opus with cloud code. We got the app, everything worked first time. We did some preparation here with uh the documentation preparation and the context engineering and that worked out well.

### 🔧 セクション 38

That's a good tip. But again, we did a new uh chip a new app uh for shipmas day two. So yeah, look out for tomorrow for day three and have a great weekend.
