## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

My name is David Andre and in the last 12 months, I spent over $150,000 on AI and I've built and sold my first AI startup. So, here is all the alpha I learned in 2025 as well as my predictions for 2026. >> All right, David. So, what was your biggest takeaway from the last 12 months? >> I think the biggest takeaway from 2025 in AI has to be that you really need to be in AI.

### 📋 背景・概要

If you just think back to January, cla code didn't exist. Codex didn't exist. So many things simply did not exist. And even the best model in CH GBT was like GBT 4.40 just crazy right now. We have GBD 5.2, we have Opus 4.5, we have Gemini 3.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

State of AI is completely changed in 12 months alone. And there's a lot of people watching it that watching this that want to be an AI that have been watching AI for 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, but still haven't taken the jump. And you have to realize every 3 months you wait, you're losing massive progress. So if you want to get into AI, if you want to take the jump, build your first AI business, whatever it is, do not delay it because 2035 is clear proof that you simply cannot wait 12 months. >> All right.

### 📝 詳細説明

So how are you going to build Asian Zero into a billion dollar company? >> Yeah. So Agent Zero, for those who don't know, is the company that acquired Vectal, my startup. And actually, I think there is a very clear path for us to make Agent Zero worth eight or nine figures. And let me prove it to you with some math.

### 💡 実例・デモ

If you look at GitHub, Agent Zero currently has around 13,000 stars. If you look at Lang Chain, it currently has over 120,000 stars. So, not even 10x more. But Langchain as a company is valued at $1.2 billion. Right?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, my plan with Agent Zero is very simple. I want to make it so that thousands if not tens of thousands of developers are building on top of agent zero and so that thousands of different companies integrate agent zero as their backend for AI agents because it's open source it's free it's private it's secure right a lot of companies don't want to use open AI or enthropic because they are not open source right so that is a very simple plan is simply grow agent zero as a product the better of a product it is the more developers will work on it and the more developers work on it the better it becomes. So I think if we get tens of thousands of developers building on top of agent zero then uh it will have immense value as an ecosystem potentially to acquire it you know two or three years or if we want to keep it and grow it for 5 to 10 years that's also a possibility. >> Mhm. All right.

### 🎯 応用例

And what was the best new AI tool that you found this year? >> Yeah. So this year a lot of new stuff came out. I mean if I had to choose one, it probably has to be Navana Pro, right? It's just took AI images to the next level.

### 💭 考察

I mean Mid Journey already existed. So you could generate amazing images, but you couldn't really edit them. At least not without, you know, doing some Loras. Like you could take Flux and do a Laura Lorax adaptation. basically fine-tune that model on your face on on your product stuff like that which most people didn't have the technical abilities to do that and it also required high quality data with Nano Banana Pro you just upload one image of yourself and it can create anything right it you can get a side profile it can put you in a business suit it can you know put you holding a large boulder whatever you want to imagine it just completely revolutionized what's possible and people were already aware about AI coding and how powerful the coding agents are like cloud code, cursor codecs.

### 📌 まとめ

But people don't realize how powerful nanoana pro is because with it you can do like a whole another thing. You can do AI designing, AI marketing, AI logos, AI photo shoots. Before if you needed like a professional headshot, you need to hire a photographer, studio, get a nice suit. All these things cost time and money. Now you just upload yourself into Navanar Pro and you have a professional headshot, right?

### ✅ 結論

That's just one example. If you're selling a physical product, you can upload a couple photos of that product and Nanovana Pro will give you this product in Greece, this product on the moon, a professional model holding this product, whatever you want. So the cost of marketing, advertising, creating assets, branding, brand identity, all of those things are going down to zero. So a lot of people understand, okay, building software and building things with AI has never been easier. The AI models are amazing at coding, but people still haven't really understood that tools like Nanabana Pro make it insanely easier to market and to get customers and to grow your AI software company.

### 📚 追加情報

All right, so that's a closed source tool. Are there any local models that you would uh point out that were really good >> for images? I think the local models are behind. I mean obviously stable diffusion has been out for a while but it's not as good at editing as Lavana Pro. Right now there was a LFM 2.6B really insane model that's literally 2.6 billion parameters but it's better than the original GBD fork right and for people who were in AI in 2023 you remember how GBD4 was like a real breakthrough.

### 🔖 補足

A lot of people don't understand like they don't remember. They think CH GBT released and it was just a smooth sailing from there. But that's actually not true. Yes, CH GBT was growing fast in even in the first month, but then it kind of plateaued. The growth slowed down.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Only in March of 2023 when GPD4 was released, then it really took off because the first model was GPD 3.5. It wasn't that good. You know, it was still obviously AI, but GPD4 was a huge improvement. And the fact that now we have a model that's just 2.6 6 billion parameters which you can run on your iPhone. That is better than GBD4.

### 🚀 セクション 14

That's insane. So local models are making massive progress and again a lot of people are simply not paying attention. >> And so why is it that you support running local models? >> I think this is like the number one way to ensure that George Orwell's future doesn't happen. Because if you think about it, having a single entity, whether it's a government, company, a p person controlling a super intelligence, like that's the Oralian future.

### ⚡ セクション 15

If we have decentralized AGI, meaning if everyone is running powerful AI models on their like PCs, phones, laptops, or like a homemade supercomputers that are open source that you can see the weights, you know what training data went into them. That is a way to prevent the biggest dystopian future. A lot of people now nowadays it's not that popular but if you go back two years there was a lot of AI doomerism you know oh like AI is going to become super powerful it's going to kill us all that stuff that is not realistic at all. The biggest danger by far is the control. Is a single bad actor, say a totalitarian government having control of AGI or super intelligence and using it to enslave everybody else for mass surveillance for total control.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Right? That is the single biggest risk. How do we prevent it? Is by decentralizing AI. The same way Bitcoin decentralized finance where you have a lot of different nodes and even if a single Bitcoin holder dies, the network continues.

### 🎬 セクション 17

We have to make sure that the same thing happens with AGI where it's a lot of different computers all across the planet and everybody knows that these models are open source and you know what training data went into the model because if you have an AGI it's going to be a super convincing super powerful entity and if you don't know what training data went into it it might have like a bias that you're not aware of right it might like force you to eat certain foods that are harmful to you or you like use different products or chemicals that will will damage you and you don't even know it because it will convince you. You know, maybe it's fine tuned to support certain brand or certain corporation and you will simply not know because if you don't if the models are not open source, you don't know what went into it. So, it's very important for many different angles, not just like the obvious privacy and security of you know, I don't want the government to know what I'm asking. Like, that's obvious. You know, if you run a model locally and if you ask it a question, nobody knows what you asked it.

### 📋 セクション 18

If you chat with CHBT, it goes through multiple different providers. It goes to OpenAI. Then it goes to Microsoft because they use their compute or whatever data center they use. So it multiple different points your data is not yours. It's going to other people.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So this is the obvious point, but people don't think long term. If you think 5, 10, 15 years into the future, we really need to make sure that open source and local models win. Otherwise, we're facing a dystopian AI control future. So obviously you're pos positioning yourself to be part of that with Agent Zero, but why do you believe that Agent Zero specifically is going to be part of that revolution? >> Yeah.

### 📝 セクション 20

So that's actually one of the main reasons why I wanted to join Agent Zero and why the acquisition makes sense is because you know now people don't realize that we're going to continue with Yan building it together. So Jan is going to be the CTO, chief technical officer. I'm going to be the CEO, chief executive officer, and together we're the co-founders of a new holding company which is going to own both Agent Zero and both Vectal. And as you said, Asian Zero is open source. It's fully private.

### 💡 セクション 21

It's completely secure. It's runable locally and it's free to use. So, it aligns perfectly with my values of what I think AI should be like and what I think the future of technology should be like. Now, in terms of if Agent Zero is that future, who knows? But what I can do is do my best to build that future.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It's like Elon when you know he co-ounded OpenAI then in 2018 he left and then he saw like release of Chad GBT and he saw Enthropic growing super fast and you know Google catching up and he was like oh [ __ ] I don't have anything. So then he founded XAI and in the first year and two years of XAI being founded they went from being completely behind and having nothing to Crock 4.1 being one of the leading AI models, right? So it's kind of the same position because he did that because at least he's in the game. When he's in the game, he has some power to control the outcome. So that's the same logic here.

### 🎯 セクション 23

I'm not saying Agent Zero will be the most popular open source AI framework, whatever. I cannot guarantee that. But what I can guarantee is if we join Agent Zio, we can build it into something that is open source, is private, is runnable locally, is secure, and does doesn't track your data, doesn't have any built-in bias, and at least it's an existing alternative to all of the open AIs of the world and anthropics of the world, which are completely closed source and which have a very strong bias in their models. >> A lot of people are asking this, what is going to happen with vectal now that you've joined agent zero? Yeah.

### 💭 セクション 24

So, to be honest, we should have made that video longer, the announcement video, because there's a lot of unanswered questions. So, first off, with vectal, a lot of people underestimate how my setup looks like in terms of AI agents, right? So, even myself, I can do a lot of lot of like improvements with a few prompts. Anytime I notice a bug, all I have to do literally, it's that simple. I just alt tab into cursor where I have codeex where I have cloth code and cursor agent obviously and I just describe the bug to all three of these coding agents and then I look at the plans whichever plan seems the best I tell it to implement it.

### 📌 セクション 25

So let's say you know cloud codes plan is the best. I have it implement then I deploy that to my dev environment and my staging environment. I leave it there for a day or two and if it looks good, if the app isn't crashing and the bug seems solved, I do a release to production. And this is all just me, right? So imagine having one developer, two developers, three developers.

### ✅ セクション 26

Imagine having automated CI/CD pipeline. For every deployment I'm doing, I'm having Cloud Code CLI check it on the GitHub pull request. I'm having Codex auto checking on the GitHub pull request. I'm having Cursor Bugbot also check it. So, this allows me to ship a lot faster while having confidence that I'm not shipping slow and that I don't have bugs.

### 📚 セクション 27

Also, I people people have to understand I have well over a thousand hours working with these different AI cooling agents. So, I know how to squeeze them to the fullest. and know how to get the most out of them in the least amount of time. So if I want to implement a new feature or redesign the front end or fix some bug, it takes me probably 10x 20x less time than a complete beginner who never used cursor or clotco. So yeah, I will continue developing vectal.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Perhaps not as aggressively as before, but it's definitely not going to sit there. I'm still going to be making sure that the best and latest models are available in there and that if there's any bug, I'm just going to fix it because uh yeah, it's simply that easy in 2026. So, you dropped some names of tools. What are some tools that uh were released this year? >> Yeah.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So I mean it's kind of crazy because if you look at like what March, April, that's when Claude Code was released and now Cloud Code is a household name. So the fact that it's less than 12 months old, it's kind of crazy. Same with OpenI Codex. I mean, it technically Codex was a name for different OpenAI products and models, but I mean, the coding agent really only became a thing in like April again. And then in June and July, we released the GPD5.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So, a lot of different things were released this year. And it kind of makes you wonder what will happen in the next year. You know, what what's going to happen in the next 6 months, in the next 12 months. If you even if you look at AI coding alone, there's going to be massive improvements, massive progress. So yeah, what matters is really staying staying at the cutting edge and paying attention.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So if you want to do that, make sure to subscribe. Which new tools do you think people should master? As I mentioned, Nanovana Pro is the obvious choice. On the topic of Google, I think definitely Notebook LM. It's very underrated.

### 🌟 セクション 32

It's probably one of the best ways to learn. So, Notebook LM is like the the podcasting is kind of crazy because you can do deep research, right? You can use Gemini to do deep research on any topic and then you can have it create a audio podcast of two people which is both our avatars talking to each other and then you can listen to that. So you can get a highly researched podcast on any topic on demand within a couple of minutes and you can listen to those whether you're driving, you know, on a plane or when you're just on a walk and you have some free time. So notebook LM for sure.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Then I would say I mean I would probably say like the the CLI tools in the terminal. A lot of people are scared of the scared of using the terminal for anything, but it's not that scary. like you really need to only know a few commands and this the sooner you get your hands wet or h your hands dirty or your feet wet the better right so if you start using clo code in terminal or codec cli or cursor CLI it doesn't really matter but just start using some terminal tools and get yourself familiar with the terminal because that will unlock a whole new world of software development >> so it's easier than ever to build stuff yourself but still a lot of people are scared so they fall into the trap of hiring very early. >> Yeah. >> What do you think about that?

### 📋 セクション 34

>> Yeah, I see this pattern quite a lot. People the moment they have some success, you know, they get their first few paying customers, maybe they reach like one, two, threek MR with their startup, they're instantly trying to hire. You can get pro like it's crazy. You can probably get to 100K MR as a solo death as a solo founder if you know how to use AI coding tools, right? So that is the big if because the less technical you are.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I think who said this? He was the founder of deal.com. So Deal.com just reached $1 billion in ARR is one of the fastest growing software companies of all time. And he said the founder's effectiveness is your ability to sell times your technical skill. Right?

### 📝 セクション 36

So if you want to build a successful company, grow it to 50k MR or whatever or sell it eventually, you shouldn't ignore this equation of what makes an effective founder. The ability to sell times your technical skill. So don't avoid either. If you're terrible with people, if you're ter terrible at camera, if you cannot sell, if you're bad at persuasion, you're not going to be able to build a large company. But the same goes for the technical side.

### 💡 セクション 37

If you're scared of the terminal, if you're scared to install an IDE, a lot of you are still using like repletable bold, which again it's fine. It's better than nothing, but you should be using VS Code or cursor. Those are proper idees where if you want to build serious software, you need a proper IDE. Same thing goes with the terminal as I said earlier. So don't be shy of learning technical stuff.

### 🔧 セクション 38

That doesn't mean you need to remember syntax. I think that's like the old paradigm. A lot of people don't have a good mental picture of what it means to be technical. That just means knowing how to use a computer and how to get a lot done with little. That doesn't mean you remember seven programming languages, right?

### 🎯 セクション 39

That's like the thing of the past. So remember this equation again. It's not from me. It's from the founder of deal.com. And if you want to be an effective founder, an effective CEO, you need both technical skill and you need ability to sell.

### 💭 セクション 40

>> Yeah. So let's say they still decide to hire. How would you manage a remote team? Have you learned anything about that with >> Vectal? Yeah, of course.

### 📌 セクション 41

Like over the last 14 months, I've learned a ton because it's a completely different skill set. First, I guess let me wrap up the previous point. Like, if you're not at $20,000 in MR, monthly recurring revenue, you shouldn't even think about hiring. Like, you should be able to do this as a solo founder easily. You just need to master the AI coding agents and you need to build in some automations, right?

### ✅ セクション 42

Whether is a proper CI/CD pipeline or some other automation that's saving you time. Don't even worry about hiring your first developer if you're not at $20,000 MR or more. Now when it comes to hiring you know once you're at that point or maybe you start a startup in multiple people and one of you is technical one of you is more business oriented that's also a good formula you know a lot of investors in fact do look at startups that are like two or three founders as more promising that I think statistically they have a higher success rate than solo founder startups but whatever the point is that when you do need to hire or whether you have already some developers on your team if it's a remote team is completely different game than having an inerson office, right? Let me give you a very concrete example. Let's say you hire a new person.

### 📚 セクション 43

It's an intern. Doesn't matter what position it is. If you have an office in a physical location, you can see that person coming in, right? You you see it's very binary. Did that person show up to work today or not?

### 🔖 セクション 44

Did he sit there and was there eight hours or did he leave after two? Right? If you hired a new person and that person left after two hours, you'd be like, "Fuck." And you probably fire him the next day, right? But some for some reason when it comes to remote, people are completely incompetent when it comes to measuring your team's performance. Like, are they showing up?

### 🎨 セクション 45

How long are they working? What are they doing? What task did they complete? This is a whole another game. And you have to realize, yeah, remote has advantages for sure.

### 🚀 セクション 46

People can work on their own time zone. you can type in a much larger pool of people, right? Like if you're in a physical location, it really matters what city you're in. That's why a lot of people build startups in SF, in London, in New York, because you need a large city with a lot of technical talent to build something in a single location. When you're remote, you can tap in people from Brazil, from Kazakhstan, from Poland, Czech Republic, Qatar, doesn't matter.

### ⚡ セクション 47

But there are also disadvantages. And probably the biggest disadvantage is is training. If you have a new hire in a physical location, that hire will be there 8 n 10 hours a day, depending how locked in your company is. But no matter what, even if it's just eight hours a day, that person will see how you and your team operate for eight hours a day, every day. So by day 30 of them joining the company, that person will be already so much more like aware of how the company functions.

### 🌟 セクション 48

what are the current business goals for this month, this quarter, this year, how you operate, what what style of communication you prefer and like what level of standards there is at the company just by day 30, right? And you really don't have to do that much because that person is there physically and it's able to pick up on different cues and behaviors. But then you take a remote remote if you do not put enough time into training that person simply doesn't know how your company works and how they should behave or how much they should do. So if you have a remote team, you have to put in dedicated time towards training people like minimum one hour per day for a new hire. Ideally two or three hours per day with different people in the company.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So that's another disadvantage. But also depending on the role you need to track performance, right? So that could be hours, that could be like pull requests, that could be some number of tasks, doesn't matter. But you really need to be strict with performance tracking when it comes to remote teams because again in person you can see what the person is doing and if they're scrolling reels on their screen you can call that out if they're [ __ ] playing Minecraft you'll see it on their screen but you won't see that in a remote team. So you need some system, some software that's tracking performance, that's tracking time, you know, project management, whatever it is.

### 📋 セクション 50

You need multiple different metrics how you can track performance and how you can spot the moment people um stop performing because there's been plenty of times where someone was working seven, eight, nine hours a day and then suddenly that dropped to like three hours a day. And if you cannot notice that within the first few days, then you will have a hard time scaling a remote team. You touched on this a little bit, but how is it possible that so many people are looking for jobs, but we still struggle to find talent? >> Yeah, this is crazy. This is like one of the biggest dichotoies in the job market, right?

### ⭐ セクション 51

More and more people are unemployed and are actively looking for positions. But as someone who runs a company and who's actively hiring for multiple different positions, this absolutely baffling. Now yeah we do get candidates lots of candidates right hundreds for some position over thousand I think for developers we have 1.5 doesn't matter basically we have hundreds of candidates from all countries imaginable but we're struggling to find competent individuals right so let's look at this what does it take to actually land a well-paying remote position at a company that lets you grow and lets you learn and lets you scale Well, it doesn't take a highly specialized knowledge. That's like people think you need PhD in machine learning and stuff like that. It's completely opposite.

### 📝 セクション 52

All it takes is the fundamentals of being a good person, of being a competent individual, showing up on time, wearing a t-shirt in the interview, giving daily reports, asking how to improve, how to learn, being humble, and listening to people who are more senior at the company. Literally, those are the fakes. Like, it cannot be simpler. Like, if you show up early to calls, if you're proactive, if you complete your tasks in the first half of the day, if you're like, if you communicate with concise messages and not long ass [ __ ] reports, if you know when to use LLMs and when to write things by hand, those are the things that people like me with, you know, remote companies that are growing fast are looking for. It's not like does this person have 10 years in AI?

### 💡 セクション 53

Yeah, obviously that would be nice, but you know AI is still rapidly evolving field and it's really been popular only for like 3 years. Same with YouTube. We're hiring for a bunch of YouTube positions, but it's been surprisingly difficult to find a competent video editor, right? We have uh our CMO who's great. We're looking to hire a second video editor, but so many of them and we're training like one or two people per week.

### 🔧 セクション 54

And again, we have hundreds of candidates, but most of them aren't even worth trying because on their video, they come in in bad lighting. They come in with a [ __ ] microphone. Legit, some of them didn't even wear a t-shirt. Some of them cannot even link the past work, right? It's just like a simple question on the forum.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Link two past videos you've edited. Somebody links like a folder with 10. Somebody links some some download file. Just link two videos. Okay?

### 💭 セクション 56

Like people are absolutely incompetent. A lot of people cannot be consistent with anything. They cannot show up early. They cannot present themselves. They're not willing to learn.

### 📌 セクション 57

And a lot of them try to like snake this. Right? If you say this is a full-time position, a lot of people will try to have [ __ ] on the side. Either their own side project, some some, you know, running an agency on the side or being employed at multiple companies and they think, you know, you won't notice. So yeah, it's it's surprising.

### ✅ セクション 58

This dichotomy is fascinating. like more and more people are unemployed. They want to find job. There's like millions of people who are actively looking for a job that's remote and online. But at the same time, companies like mine are struggling to find competent people simply because all these candidates don't have the basics of what it takes to be a great team member.

### 📚 セクション 59

>> Yeah. So, especially when you're hiring like this, you're eventually going to have to make some difficult decisions. So, how do you go about making difficult decisions? >> Yeah, I mean to be honest, I think this is probably one of my biggest strengths as a person, not just in business, but in life is in general. Like whether it's like stop being friends with somebody who you knew for 10 years or exiting a relationship that you're both like deeply in love but it just doesn't make sense or firing an employee that you know you have a close connection with or firing multiple employees in a single day.

### 🔖 セクション 60

You know that's the next level. Yeah it it's it's u never easy and I think the best like way to think about it is there's never an easy time to make a hard decision right. So a lot of people will wait will they will delay it. They postpone it. But that only makes it harder.

### 🎨 セクション 61

And I think it was Ben Horvitz who said the biggest mistake you can make in business is to hesitate. As a CEO, the worst mistake, the biggest sin you can make is to hesitate. Doesn't matter what situation you're in. You have to realize that action produces information. So if you're like faced with two bad options, simply acting and doing something will result in new information which allow you to progress further.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So you cannot hesitate, you cannot postpone, you cannot delay. It's it's honestly a muscle, right? Like you have to recall past experiences where you made a hard decision or if you haven't, you have to simply must up the balls and do it again. Sometimes that involves completely killing a startup idea when it doesn't work. Sometimes that involves firing your best friend.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Sometimes that involves fighting multiple people in the same day and you know taking two steps back like in the past for example when I was running the Minecraft channel a lot of people couldn't do this like I was 20 years old I was making between 20 and $30,000 per month all basically all profit and I decided to completely stop it switch into AI my income went down to $600 a month I decided to move in back with my parents which is a massive social hit all these things like to me are obvious because again I think it's one of my strengths the ability to make hard decisions like to me once something is obvious that longterm this doesn't make sense or like longterm I'll have to do this then I I tend to not delay it by more than a month but it really is a muscle so you have to realize like the opportunity cost you have to realize that it also wears you down personally there was like a I don't know what it was it was some study of showing how unmade decisions are directly related to some like chronic diseases that you're actually physically sick. You're your likelihood of getting sick is much higher if you have like multiple unmade decisions that are like crippling in your life. I know there's one story of a guy who had a what was it this like some bowel disease like acid acid reflux I think basically he had to sleep in while was sitting because it was so bad and it was like going for months and years and it stopped the day he asked his wife for divorce because he knew that this wife he has to divorce her and he kept delaying it for months and years and literally to the point of developing acid reflux a serious health condition right so you have to realize the cost of unmade decisions is much higher than you think and it usually comes with some health cost as well. >> So you touched on this a little bit but at what point do you think it's not planning but overthinking and how do you avoid overthinking? >> Yeah, also this is a super common mistake when people go into AI when they want to build their AI business.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Like so many of you guys are overprepared. you've spent too much time planning, you know, drafting, thinking about the idea, researching the markets, all that stuff. It's productive procrastination. You feel good while you're doing it, but it actually isn't accomplishing anything. And you have to realize every unit of time, let's say every hour, could be spent in many different ways.

### 🎬 セクション 65

This hour doesn't exist in a vacuum. This is also a great topic that I want to touch upon. a lot of people who are kind of beginner entrepreneurs or like you know newer to life. I don't know how to explain it. They they're not they're not doing difficult things or they haven't been like really pushing their limits for a long time.

### 📋 セクション 66

Most people don't realize that nothing exists in a vacuum. Let's say somebody says like yo David do you have time for a five minute phone call? Sure you can say like it's a five-minute phone call. And even if it actually ends up being 5 minutes, which almost never is, even if it was exactly 5 minutes, it's not the five minute cost that assumes that time exists in a vacuum. But it doesn't.

### ⭐ セクション 67

In those five minutes, I could have done anything else on my calendar, anything else in my task list, anything else possible in this universe. So you have to realize everything you're doing, you have to contrast it with the other options. This is one of the dangerous things. is like working on the seven out of 10 task. What's not dangerous is like the one out of 10, two out of 10 waste of time, right?

### 📝 セクション 68

Like scrolling Instagram, scrolling Twitter, watching Netflix, everybody understands those are a waste of time. What's really dangerous in life is the seven out of 10 tasks. The things that feel productive, that seem productive, but actually aren't doing anything. They are not the 10 out of 10 most important task. Solving the biggest problem in your life or the biggest obstacle in your business.

### 💡 セクション 69

They're like the seven out of 10 thing. You're checking emails, scrolling your calendar, whatever it is for you, right? Responding to Slack, those are the most dangerous. So this lesson of that nothing exists in a vacuum. You have to really understand this with your time, with your energy, with your actions, but taking on a new project.

### 🔧 セクション 70

You know, nothing is free. People think, okay, I'm just going to join this new project. But anything you start has a cost to the things you're already doing and those are usually the most important. Right? So for example, if you're going to the gym four times a week, if you start some new project and it results you to not go to the gym four times a week but only go once or twice, you have to wait against that cost.

### 🎯 セクション 71

A lot of the times it's not worth it. So with the preparation question again that time doesn't exist in a vacuum. If you spend 50 hours researching a startup idea and you know drafting on a micro board and all that stuff that time could have been spent on validating or invalidating the idea and maybe finding out okay the market doesn't want it and moving on to something else and starting the second startup already. So no time exists in a vacuum. Don't overprepare.

### 💭 セクション 72

Focus on validating your startup idea as fast as possible. Focus on getting the first paying customer as fast as possible. Are there any uh tricks that you use to uh be mindful of your time? Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of things I've learned over the years.

### 📌 セクション 73

People have to understand like I've been like on the self-improvement path for I don't know since like maybe 15, maybe 14. So that's like 9 years. So there's a lot of things that are like second nature to me that to people seem crazy. Maybe the most radical is tracking every 15 minutes in calendar. People think that's like some insane notion and that I always stress about time, but it's really simple and within two weeks, which coincidentally that's like the typical time it takes to develop a new habit.

### ✅ セクション 74

It it's it's like you get used to it, right? When you're going somewhere, if you know it's going to be 60 minutes, you just put a 60-minute block. Or if you don't know how things are, you just track it every 15 minutes. And what I did is I wrote a I used AI to write a custom Python script that makes like a subtle sound on my MacBook every 15 minutes so I know to go into Google calendar and track it. Now you might thinking, "Okay, David, what about deep work?

### 📚 セクション 75

Does it interrupt your focus?" Actually, and by the way, this is from Hormosi, so I'm not going to take credit for this, but actually it doesn't interrupt your focus because if you're already focused, you continue. If you're wasting time, however, you'll have to track that you're on social media on or that you're doing something unproductive. And that is like very painful. Nobody wants to put a red block into your calendar showing that you're wasting time, which again most of the time will refocus you on the thing that actually matters. So this is one of the habits that definitely is useful and you don't have to do it permanently, but I think everybody should do it for a period of two to three weeks so that you can actually see how you spend your time.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Because a lot of you guys, you have a completely distorted view of where your time goes. You might think that, you know, you only spend two hours a day on your phone or that you don't spend that much time on Twitter or YouTube and that you actually work a lot more. But when you start tracking this, you realize, yeah, you might be at your job for eight hours or at a computer for eight hours, but you're only working four of those if you're good. So, a lot of people think they're working eight hours a day, but if they actually tracked every 15 minutes, they would realize that they're working like three or four. This is one of the habits.

### 🎨 セクション 77

So, what else do I do? Well, I have people review my stuff, right? So, M, you help me with this. Every week you review my calendar and just give me input on what I'm doing. Because sometimes you need to remove your ego and you need to have somebody else look at your actions and see like is this aligned with how you should be spending your time.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Are you doing something that's like super low leverage that maybe you should stop doing or that you should delegate to somebody else? That's also helps. Just working with a timer also helps. You know another hormosi tip like there's a lot of fundamentals. People think there some secret tricks but there's a lot of fundamentals.

### ⚡ セクション 79

It's like having an office that's closed, right? Not having your wife or your girlfriend walking around the same room or or your kids. Like you should have a closed room, closed office that you can work in. You should have noise cancelling headphones. If there's still a lot of noise, you should wear earplugs and noise cancelling headphones.

### 🌟 セクション 80

You should invest into a good computer. If your computer is lagging and you're [ __ ] switching windows and there's like two seconds delay, it's going to throw you off. So, invest in good hardware. A lot a lot of basics. Invest in a good monitor, right?

### 🎬 セクション 81

A nice chair that you can sit in, a standing desk so you can alternate between sitting and standing. Lots of lots of fundamentals that over the years add up and you know become second nature. So yeah, when you ask me this question, I kind of struggle with answering because so many of these things are absolutely obvious to me, but it's kind of crazy how many people don't even do them. And one more thing, food coma. If you're working and you go for a lunch and you take a bunch of fries or potatoes or bunch of carbs, you're you're stupid.

### 📋 セクション 82

You're actually [ __ ] because the next two or three hours are going to be so much less productive, right? You want to eat a low carb, high protein diet, not only to get these gains from the gym, obvious, but to also not give yourself food coma. What you eat has massive impact on your focus and productivity. So, if you're constantly, you know, battling these carbs and like these uh processed refined carbohydrates, you're going to have a hard time focusing. So, like you want to stack the things in your favor.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Another pro tip is getting a CO2 monitor. A lot of you are working in an office or in a room with super high CO2, like 1500 or 2,000 ppm, which is parts per million, which means how many CO2 molecules there are per 1 million air molecules in that air. If you simply ventilate or open your window and get the CO2 levels down to like 400 to 600, you're going to have a much easier time focusing, right? So, all of these things are absolute fundamentals. All of these things you can do to stack the odds in your favor so that you don't have to rely on willpower or motivation to be productive.

### 📝 セクション 84

So, obviously, there are a lot of ways to be more productive yourself and not waste time. But what was the biggest time waste with Vectal? >> Biggest time waste? I mean, I would say I'm going to answer differently. I'm going to say the biggest money waste was like being spending too much, right?

### 💡 セクション 85

Because I had other successful businesses and I could spend the money. But what I didn't realize and only later on is that if you look at you know Uber or Amazon which are the two examples that people always give of companies that were unprofitable for a long amount of time the reason they were spending so much money is to grow is to get more market share is to grow their customer base and there was a there was a very clear reason why they're spending money. So in the early days I started spending a lot of money on velo because I wanted to like take more risk right almost all of us don't take enough risk in life and business. So I just wanted to take more risk but there wasn't really any clear ROI. So that was definitely a mistake.

### 🔧 セクション 86

The biggest time waste probably adding the team plan too soon to be honest and that wasn't a core feature right like we needed to first validate the core features and make sure that for a single user the the app was really good really smooth super useful but we added a team plan because we kind of needed it as our own. But then when we added it, first of all, it added like 20,000 lines of code into the codebase. So it created massive technical debt, massive amount of complexity, a lot more stuff to maintain. Like if you add any feature, you have to test. Does it work well for a single user?

### 🎯 セクション 87

Does it well work for a team owner? Does it well work for a team member? Lots of complexity, slows down development, makes it harder to maintain, and inevitably creates more bucks. But again, it wasn't a core feature. It didn't even add that much revenue.

### 💭 セクション 88

Like maybe we had like 5% of our revenue coming from team clients. So that definitely wasn't worth it at all and that wasted weeks of development. >> Mhm. So a good way to avoid this would be to ask for feedback. But >> yeah, >> a lot of people are working solo.

### 📌 セクション 89

So who should they ask? >> Yeah. So, the best thing you can do is sit down with a customer or someone who is a potential customer. And I define a potential customer as somebody who fits into your target avatar, aka people who should be using your app, people who you're building the app for, right? And give them your app and watch them for 20 to 30 minutes.

### ✅ セクション 90

Don't send it to them beforehand like, "Yo, John, check this out." No. for the first time ever they have to be using your app. You sit them down for 30 minutes and you watch how they use it. Is the landing page clear enough or do they get confused of what you're building? Is the onboarding clear or is it too long or do they get annoyed?

### 📚 セクション 91

What about the what about some features maybe they cannot even find one of the main features because the UI is bad and it's kind of hidden. This is invaluable. You're going to learn so many things that to you as the founder are not obvious and that you're kind of blind to because you've been building your app, your your software from day one. Now you have to realize how you make decisions doesn't only rely on your customers, right? This only a data point.

### 🔖 セクション 92

You have to think of all things as a data point. So what your customers tell you is a data point. What you see your competitors doing as a data point. What your employees and other team members tell you as a data point. what you read in a book or watch in a YouTube video is the data point.

### 🎨 セクション 93

But ultimately you as the founder, you as the CEO have to take in all the data and refine your own judgment to make the best decision possible. So there is no simple answer to like listen to your customers. Obviously you should talk to your customers as much as possible. If you're in the early stages of the startup, minimum one or two hours per day, you should be talking to your customers and personally onboarding them and you know being available 24/7 for uh response and and like answering questions. But you shouldn't listen to them 100% in terms of what features to add, what changes to make because ultimately you need a clear vision for the product and you need to develop that fingertip feel, that judgment as a founder.

### 🚀 セクション 94

So yeah. >> All right. Are there any books that you would specifically recommend to new founders? >> Yeah. Before I touch on that, ebikes are cheating.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Okay. Let's get that clear. Okay. Books to new founders. I mean um I would say like a lot of the classics like zero to one from Peter Peele, the lean startup which is like about validating assumptions.

### 🌟 セクション 96

The hard thing about hard things. Well, that one from Ben Horvitz is more for people who already have a startup, but they're kind of struggling to grow or they're struggling to validate the product. But yeah, like really these books, you should read them, but they're not you're not going to understand them on a deep intimate level if you haven't done anything because the way to read books and the way to learn is to first do a [ __ ] ton of actions, right? do lots of volume and then you read some material and then it clicks because you can recall your own experiences and your own failures and you're like oh my god I made this mistake exactly the way he described it and then you listen to the solution the book provides but if you read the book first and you have no experience you're going to read like okay looks like good advice but you're probably going to forget it the next day so don't focus on reading books focus on taking massive actions a lot of you guys are compulsive watchers which again I appreciate it like if you watch every single video It means a lot, but at some point you have to take action, right? So, if you've been watching AI videos for 12 months, but you you still haven't started your own AI business or you still haven't switched industries to be an AI, it's time.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Yeah. One issue that a lot of people run into when they start their own startup is that they lack money specifically for advertising. So, how would you advertise if people don't have cash? Yeah, I would say this is a pretty common myth that you need money to start a business and I know it firsthand because when I was 15 16 I didn't have any money and my parents didn't give me any money and I had too much ego to ask for any money. So every single business I started maybe before vectal like maybe vectal is the first business that I started with money every single business before that I started with zero money which means the business had to be profitable from day one.

### 📋 セクション 98

So how did I go from literally like my first seven year in business everything I did was profitable day one aka started with zero money. So this is a huge myth that you need to run paid ads or do some crazy advertising at the beginning. You can get your first few paying customers completely for free. And there are many different methods, right? First of all, organic content.

### ⭐ セクション 99

You can post on YouTube. You can post on Twitter. You can post on Instagram or on all of these platforms. Number two, SEO. You can create a website and write blog articles.

### 📝 セクション 100

Use LLM to help you write more blog articles and more SEO optimized blog articles and then you get traffic that way. Number three, cold DM. you go to where your audience is located. So, let's say you're just selling like fast fashion. You're selling some clothing that's like in the niche of like Zara and H&M, right?

### 💡 セクション 101

How do you find people that are interesting in this clothing? Well, you go to H&M Instagram. Let's say you're close selling men's clothing, right? So, like you go to H&M men Instagram account. You go to the latest post and you click on the people who like the latest post.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Now the latest post is going to be only few days old and you're going to literally see people who are actively liking fast fashion for men. What then you can do is you can go and DM these people called DM them on Instagram one by one. Start with a simple question like yo how's your Tuesday which will give you a higher response rate and then you sell them from there. If you don't know how to sell, ask a reasoning model cloth 4.5 Opus GBT 5.2 to pro. How would I give me a step-by-step sales script for closing people with Instagram DM cold leads for X product and you describe your product.

### 🎯 セクション 103

That's just one way. Another way could be subreddits, right? Or spirit communities where you find a subreddit in your own niche or industry and you start interacting there. You develop some reputation in that community. Or Facebook groups, that's another thing.

### 💭 セクション 104

Or school communities, that's another thing. You go into school communities that are relevant to your industry, start talking to the people, become one of the most active people in the community, you know, develop some friends, and then you'll be able to DM those people, mention what you're doing, solve the problem, or maybe even the admins will like you and let you do a post that's like half value, half advertising. So many different ways of getting customers with any money. Obviously, they take time and they take some creativity, but it's a huge myth that you need a large advertising budget to start. Mhm.

### 📌 セクション 105

What's the biggest mistake people make when trying to uh make money with AI? >> Okay. The biggest mistake? Well, I think the single biggest mistake is a bad business model. It's like the Warren Buffett saying like it doesn't matter what boat you're in, but how hard you're rowing.

### ✅ セクション 106

What matters what boat you're in, right? You might be the hardest rower. You might be the hardest worker, the smartest person in this universe, but if you're working on something that nobody wants, if you're trying to be an elevator boy, which is automated and replaced, you know, that job no longer exists, you're you're not going to win. So, in AI, it's all about what you're building and what business model you choose. A lot of people choose a business model that's becoming obsolete, that's saturated, that's highly competitive, that requires a high startup budget, that doesn't give them enough time freedom.

### 📚 セクション 107

So choosing the right business model is the single biggest decision that's going to impact whether you're successful in AI or not. And actually, we made a whole video on that, which I'm going to link to here. If you want to start your own air business, watch this video
