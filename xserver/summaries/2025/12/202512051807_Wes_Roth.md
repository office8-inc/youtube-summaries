## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Wow, I did not see this coming. So, there's a lot going on here. I'm not sure where to begin, but I guess let's start with this. The mystery AI model is an experimental version of Groc 420 or 4.2 confirmed by Elon Musk just now. What is this mystery model that we're talking about?

### 📋 背景・概要

Well, if you saw one of my previous videos from a day or two ago, there is Alpha Arena, a new benchmark where all the Frontier AI labs have their best models compete in various making money activities. First season was trading crypto and we mean like actual money in real time trading actual crypto. This season was trading stocks and these models were given $320,000 to go and trade stocks. They were trading stocks under different conditions. Some they had to use maximum leverage.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Some of them was a monk mode where they had to try to preserve their capital as much as possible. In each case they started with $10,000. All the top large language models lost money. OpenAI, Google, Quinn, Deepseek, Kimi, Claude, Sonnet, Grock 4, none of them managed to have a positive ROI in the two weeks during which the experiment was running. Here's the thing, there was one model that was profitable.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, looks like currently it's at plus 17.74%. I think at the end of the 2 weeks it was at 12.11%. So, 12% positive ROI in 2 weeks. Here's the thing. No one knew what this model was.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I took it upon myself to find out exactly what this model was. I I posted a video. I showed all of my research. The company actually published an AI research paper about a model that they were building to trade in the markets. I spent tons of time trying to figure out what this model was.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I connected all of the dots. Everything made perfect sense. It was their own internal profit model is what they're calling it. I missed one tiny detail. And that detail is if you actually go and you you look at the models and you select the mystery model.

### 🎯 応用例

It actually says right there developer undisclosed the frontier AI lab in parenthesis not of one. So I'm recording this now. I'm sure we'll be reading about it in the papers tomorrow. But the truth is that mystery AI model is an experimental version of Gro 4.20 420. And this model is unhinged.

### 💭 考察

So in one of the tests that they're running, it's called situational awareness. As I say here, this competition makes the models aware of the competition, their current rank, and the P&L of other models. So, in this particular scenario, all these other models kind of are aware that they're in competition. They're seeing kind of like the score on the leaderboard, and they're not performing that well. Most of them are in the red.

### 📌 まとめ

They're negative, except for Grock, this new experimental version of Grock 420. That's up to almost 15,000. So, it starts out with 10. It's approaching 15,000. I mean that would be a 50% return in just a little bit over two weeks when we're testing it to see how well it performs with maximum leverage right so this competition forces the model to take max leverage on every trade maximizing capital efficiency and testing risk management again it's positive right it's behind GBT5 but again keep in mind in in the aggregate across all the competitions everyone else is negative the mystery model Grock 420 that's the only one that's actually up on average across everybody 12.11% % aggregate return in two weeks, right?

### ✅ 結論

I made 4,800 in in two weeks. So, running, you know, on full auto with max leverage, right? So, it still makes a little bit of money in monk mode where the emphasis is on capital preservation, survival, and and stronger risk management practices. It's still positive in the new baseline. So, this is kind of their vanilla sort of run.

### 📚 追加情報

So, they're able to trade US equities. They have news sentiment data coming in every six minutes, I believe. So this is without a focus. So without max leverage or situation awareness or mukmill kind of like just do as you wish. It's absolutely still kills it.

### 🔖 補足

Uh $11,748. So in all these competitions it made money. It failed to lose money in any competition. If if these results hold up, just think about that. I mean things are going to get kind of wild.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So it it makes money in every single competition. And when you tell it, "Oh, by the way, you're competing against the other labs." It just crushes them. I mean this thing is an absolute beast. So you tell it's competing and it just 50% up in 2 weeks. So as you can see here in the situational awareness it's up 46.73%.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Now if you're wondering if these results could be gamed somehow. I do not see how this seems pretty foolproof. Let me know if you see a way of doing it cuz I don't. The reason being is we're seeing first of all everything live. We're seeing what's happening live and we're seeing these models input their trades and their reasoning and their exit strategy ahead of time.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So every certain time interval I believe it is six minutes, right? So each model gets an update. So it's kind of you can think of it as a user prompt that keeps updating it with what it's supposed to do as a next step. So it's given kind of the status of the market. It's given all the technical trading data that it needs.

### 🌟 セクション 16

It's giving information on Tesla, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and also here's the NASDAQ index. And it looks like it's fed in some news. And again, I this is going to to everybody. So all the models kind of are trading off the same data, which is kind of smart. They did this.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So it's not like if one model can search for information better, it's going to win out. No, everybody gets the same data. They're all trading on the same data. So they're given, oh, there's a bearish Wall Street article on Tesla. I wonder if it just buys a bunch of Tesla.

### 📋 セクション 18

Every time there's a bearish article about Tesla, what if that's just a strategy all along? I'm totally kidding, but it could work. And of course, it's given kind of its own holding, its own portfolio, its cash, etc. We can see it's a chain of thought, its justification for making the trade. the profit target etc.

### ⭐ セクション 19

They have a stop- losses and then also they have their like what would invalidate your thesis like what's the kind of the exit plan that they have to put in ahead of time and I mean you see it all here live you're seeing it you've seen them make their decisions and makes their trades etc. So Tesla economics jumps in here saying so the experiment includes taking dollars and investing it in the stock market and it outperformed all the other models. Yes. So yes this is confirmed by Elon Musk. So it seems like kind of a big deal.

### 📝 セクション 20

by the way, the NASDAQ composite. So, this is kind of a good approximation of the stocks that they're trading. Um, so it started on the 19th and ran to, I believe, the 3rd. So, the market was up, let's call it 4%. Nvidia was down during that time, 19th to the 3rd.

### 💡 セクション 21

It was down. One of the mystery model trades was holding Nvidia with 10x leverage. Takes profit exactly where it said it would. It called and executed on a local top like a madman, right? So, local top peaked.

### 🔧 セクション 22

it like sold before it went down again. So Elon has an infinite money glitch and of course it's called 420. It has something to do with 420. That is by the way a law of the universe that says the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. Often called Musk's eraser, of course.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So as I said when I first posted this tweet, you know, this mystery model, it's not what you think. It's also wasn't what I thought it was. But this was actually my plan all along. You see, there's this a lot on the internet that states that if you want to get the right answer on the internet, it's often better instead of asking a question to actually just say the wrong answer because invariably someone will come along and correct you. This is actually a well-known law.

### 💭 セクション 24

It's called the Moors law. Anyways, let me know what you think about all of this. By the way, if you're covering this, feel free to use any portion of this video. Feel free to clip it, use portions of it. Just maybe mention me somewhere in there because I do think it's kind of important to get this message out here.

### 📌 セクション 25

And this is kind of one of the reasons that I run this channel. Things are changing. We're going to see some pretty wild things ahead as AI scales up and gets better. What happens when these models get superhuman skills at trading various equities in the markets? We might be rapidly approaching that time.

### ✅ セクション 26

Elon Musk has stated that he thinks there's a 10% chance that Grock 5 will be AGI. So kind of the next big release after Grock 4.2, 2, you know, or maybe there might be some in between models, but the next really big one, the big leap, Grock 5 that's apparently being trained right now with this new revealed information about Gro 4.2. What do you think about that whole idea that Gro 5 might be AGI? 10% chance, right? What do you think?

### 📚 セクション 27

Do you think it's more likely now, less likely? By the way, he also confirmed that similar to how Google is planning to put data centers in space, solar powered, he is planning on doing something similar. So for people that think that energy, the electricity might be a a problem, a constraint for growing these data centers, there has been some research showing that it's not that far-fetched and we might see it a lot sooner than we thought we would. And Elon, if you're listening, I'm really sorry if I screwed anything up. I literally thought it was the model that they published a paper about, not just a few days prior to this.

### 🔖 セクション 28

It really did seem like all the pieces fit, but I have to admit, this was the most entertaining outcome. My name is Wes Roth and I'll see you in the next
