## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So let's check out our agents customization screen. So here we have arbitrage logic high frequency CPU risk dampener prediction engine quantum trading market analysis and we get this drone model and this hash rate greed and speed. Okay, that was pretty cool. Today I think we have a pretty cool application we're going to build. So I'm just going to walk you through what we're going to do today.

### 📋 背景・概要

So the basic idea is that I wanted an application where I can just speak out and it will record my voice. So I uh kind of uh based this on that I want to speak in some kind of ID I have. It could be anything but I want to focus on some IDs. And when the user speaks in this we're going to record this and we're going to transcribe it with uh to text using whisper. And from there when we have the text we can use Gemini 3 and we can use Nano Banana uh Pro to generate five visuals and an overview and a rating on the ID.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So you end up with kind of like a one pager that you can see some visuals around your ID. You can see some text maybe you get a rating or something like that. I think it turned out pretty cool and I want to show you kind of how I did this and how this uh application works now. So, as always, let me show you kind of what documentation I needed to actually build this in cloud code. And basically, I just needed again the Gemini 3 documentation and I brought in some documentation around Nano Banana Pro that we have used before in this uh shipment series.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, if we head over to Claude now, I can just go in here and basically again I just basically said what kind of application I want. I went to plan mode. Uh I don't have any recording of me actually building the app uh because I did that yesterday. But uh I think we want to do some small changes today and you can kind of see how I use cloud code and Opus 4.5 to do that. But now I think we're just going to run some demos of the application we built and see if there are anything we want to change some small tweaks and stuff.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So let's just do an uh I think we're going to do an MPM uh was it rundev or was it start? I can't remember. Let's try start and let's just head over to localhost 3000 refresh. And here you can kind of see the app. So you can see it kind of saved some of the IDs I did in my testing yesterday.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So I think I want to try to replicate those. And you can see we have share your ID. We can do text. We can do record. So basically when we record this uh this will be saved and transcribed with whisper.

### 🎯 応用例

And you can kind of see this. So let me just try to record an ID. I'm just going to come up with something here live now. So, I'm just going to press start record. Okay.

### 💭 考察

So, I have an idea where uh I want some kind of device that I can put next to my let's say my flowers or something. Put it in like a pot where I have the flowers. This has some kind of metal rod that is measuring maybe some uh um humidity or the temperature and it also take images of the plant. So it always monitor the plant. It's very easy to deploy.

### 📌 まとめ

It runs on like a USBC charger. So it has a long battery with a small camera and it could be connected to the cloud. So uh on my app I can always follow along with all my plants, see how they are doing. Maybe it had some AI analysis or something like that. So yeah uh that is basically me my ID.

### ✅ 結論

So you can see it now. I just pressed stop and you can see transcribing audio with whisper and this is going to take some time and after we have gotten it in text I think it should pop up. Yeah. Okay, that was pretty fast. And now you can see we are analyzing your ID with Gemini and then we're going to do the illustrations or visualizations.

### 📚 追加情報

And yeah, let's just see how this turns out. Okay, so you can see we got this uh title here. Flora lens smart stick. see what your plants feel. That is basically what we turned this into.

### 🔖 補足

Okay, so we got a rating of 8 to 10. And here comes our images. So this is our hero product. We can kind of see a camera sticking into the soil here. And we got a closeup of the hero product.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Okay, that looks pretty cool. And yeah, let's see what else we got here. You can see we have the analysis, an intelligent camera equipped IoT monitoring stick. Uh, and yeah, we get some feedback. We get some suggested improvements.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Add a module solar planner clip on accessory to extend battery life near windows. Okay, that's pretty smart. Include a man manual privacy shutter for the camera since this will be placed inside homes. Also a good idea. Design the head of the device to be adjustable, tiltable.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Okay, not bad. So, yeah. And we got a a mobile um UI mockup. Okay, that's pretty cool. Uh Insitu lifestyle photography.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay, so here we can see our flora lens. It's inside the plant. Pretty cool. And then we get a technical um exploited. Okay, so here like a blueprint.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, we have the visual sensor, the neural processor, lithium battery, hydrometer rod, and the USBC. Pretty cool. Uh, let's see now. Here's the macro detailed shot of the Flora lens. Okay, so you kind of get the point here.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, I went from just reading in my ID to ending up with something like this. And maybe I had some kind of export or something. Export to PDF. I haven't fixed that. Uh, but I think that's a pretty cool thing you can do.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Uh, I want to try it on one different idea. So, let's try to visualize like a video game. Okay. So, let's try a new ID. So, we're just going to click on new ID.

### 📝 セクション 20

We're going to keep those. And I'm going to record this. So, I'm just going to think of an idea. I think I have something. So, let me just record this.

### 💡 セクション 21

Okay. So, I have a pretty cool idea for a video game. So the game is going to be more of like um a realtime uh game where you uh control and generate AI agents. So you can train these agents. So basically they can be trained or leveled up in like cryptocurrency.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Some agents you can train up, level up, pick skills and stuff maybe for poly market prediction markets. Some could do stock options. So basically you in the game you control like a fleet of AI agents that you send out to maybe earn money. So it's more like a a real life game play. Uh you pay a fee of course to get access to the platform that can execute and the platform we run of course will take a cut of the earnings from the AI agents.

### 🎯 セクション 23

uh the players will need to stake their AI agents themselves, but we kind of provide the platform, the interface and stuff like that. So, uh I kind of want the interface and the look of the game to be more like this um more this like isometric uh hacker look with like a terminal pixelated styling. Okay, so let's just try that idea. I'm not 100% sure if that's going to work, but let's see what Gemini comes up with here. And I also think the idea is going to get a really low rating because that is like a ludicrous idea, right?

### 💭 セクション 24

But let's just see what happens. Oh wow, we did get actually an eight out of 10. Net yield zero. Okay, that was a bit pretty cool name. Deploy the code.

### 📌 セクション 25

Harvest their reality. Okay, so let's see what the visuals is going to look like. Okay, not too bad. I kind of like this. So this is the command deck UI.

### ✅ セクション 26

So we kind of have like some uh bots here. We have some code. We have some Bitcoin. Okay, maybe not the most um uh useful thing, but let's see what else turns up here. Let's read some of the points.

### 📚 セクション 27

Realtime strategy mechanics applied to financial markets. RPG style progression for AI agents. Uh real money economic only staking and yield sharing. Okay. Integration with data sources like poly market and stock exchanges.

### 🔖 セクション 28

The feedback is this is a cultural relevant high potential concept that merges addictive loops of RPG management games with [music] the thrill of crypto speculation. Okay, I think this is a cool idea. So improvements are implement a sandbox mode using paper money. So then test. Okay, that's a good idea.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Create guilds and syndicates where players pull computational power. Okay, that's pretty cool. Uh, add a visual boss battles representing high volatility market events, earning calls, election results. All right, not too bad. So, let's check out our agents customization screen.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So, here we have arbitrage logic, high frequency CPU, risk dampener, prediction engine, quantum trading, market analysis, and we get this drone model and this hash rate, greed, and speed. Okay, that was pretty cool. I'm going to download this one. This was awesome. And here we kind of see the network.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So this is the an isometric world map representing different financial markets. We have the poly market, crypto, commodities, derivatives, forex, forex, and we going to have some Yeah, maybe the players can move around. We have uh what is this? A visual representation of agent executing a trade. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And here kind of is the logo for the game. net yield. All right, pretty cool. Yeah, I think this turned out very well. And we can kind of see from this application how fast we can kind of go from an ID, we get like a suggestion of a uh a name.

### 🎬 セクション 33

We also get some visuals, you get an an AI analysis of the ID and you get some suggested improvements. I think this is just super cool. I I really like this app. This is one of the favorites we have made so far in the shipment series. We can go back and check this, right?

### 📋 セクション 34

So, we can see the one we made before. And yeah, this is working pretty good. But to be honest, I don't think I need to change anything. I was kind of ready to go into cloud code and make some changes to this app. Uh, but I just think it works.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I don't think I need to do anything. Maybe we could have had something that could you could follow up and make some changes. Uh, but other than that, I think it looks pretty cool. I really enjoy this one, the drone unit, right? and the BIOS setup utility.

### 📝 セクション 36

Uh but yeah, that was uh this day's uh AI app suggestion or like uh yeah, and thank you for tuning in so far. Uh it's been really fun to doing this daily and I'm going to keep trying to do this more. So yeah, have a great day and I'll see you again hopefully tomorrow, if not day of day
