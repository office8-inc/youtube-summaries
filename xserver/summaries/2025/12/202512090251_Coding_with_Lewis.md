## 💡 概要

この動画では、49,000人以上の開発者が参加した大規模調査の結果を紹介しています。JavaScriptが依然として最も人気の言語であり、Visual Studio Codeが圧倒的なシェアを誇る一方、Cursorの急成長が注目されています。Rustは最も「憧れの言語」として支持され、ChatGPTが最も利用されるAIモデルとなっています。開発者コミュニティの現状とAI技術への複雑な感情が明らかになった、プログラミング業界の最新トレンドを理解できる内容です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **フルスタック開発者の優位**: 27%以上がフルスタック開発者として活動。JavaScriptとNode.jsが引き続きWeb開発の主流を維持
- **VS Codeの圧倒的シェア**: 76%の開発者がVisual Studio Codeを使用。Cursorがゼロから急成長し、新しいコードエディタとして台頭
- **Rustへの憧れ**: 毎年「最も憧れの言語」としてRustがトップ。速度とパフォーマンスを求める開発者からの支持が高い
- **AI信頼度の二極化**: 3%のみが「高度に信頼」、多くは「ある程度信頼」。AIツールは依然として開発者の間で議論の的
- **ChatGPTの人気**: OpenAIのGPTが最も使用されるAIモデル。Claude Sonnetがクロードコードなどで第2位にランクイン

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Over 49,000 developers gave their opinion on the state of programming. Here it is. Now, over 27% of developers are full stack developers, which honestly is pretty crazy. JavaScript is still the most popular language. No surprise there really, but it's just insane how it still dominates after all this time.

### 📋 背景・概要

And Noode.js being one of the most used web uh framework is actually pretty cool, too. And now I just find this really crazy that Visual Studio Code is like so far ahead of everything else. cursor probably jumped the highest from like zero to this, but like still 76%. That's just such a massive W. I love this one too where it's like community platforms, you know, you're filling out our our survey here maybe uh throw us a vote so we don't get completely replaced by AI.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Open AAI's GBT is the most popular model by far which kind of makes sense because like Chad GBT is what most people think of when they think AI while sonnet being second which is kind of like the more popular option with like claude code and everything and Rust right here is the most admired language as it always is every single year people just want that speed baby. Now let's look at the bottom here for desired admired. I want to know that 1.3% of people who are like oh I just like desire it. [laughter] I need it. And again, Stack Overflow giving them a whole entire section here like frequency a few times per month, multiple times per day.

### 📝 詳細説明

And this section right here is really interesting with accuracy of AI tools. 3% have said they highly trust it, which you know, I definitely don't highly trust it either, but I definitely do somewhat trust it better than me, but then highly distrust. So, it's interesting to see how like it's still such a polarizing topic, especially amongst developers. What are [music] your thoughts? Do you agree or disagree with anything that these developers have said?

### 💡 実例・デモ

Let me know.
