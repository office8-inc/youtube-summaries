## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Over 49,000 developers gave their opinion on the state of programming. Here it is. Now, over 27% of developers are full stack developers, which honestly is pretty crazy. JavaScript is still the most popular language. No surprise there really, but it's just insane how it still dominates after all this time.

### 📋 背景・概要

And Noode.js being one of the most used web uh framework is actually pretty cool, too. And now I just find this really crazy that Visual Studio Code is like so far ahead of everything else. cursor probably jumped the highest from like zero to this, but like still 76%. That's just such a massive W. I love this one too where it's like community platforms, you know, you're filling out our our survey here maybe uh throw us a vote so we don't get completely replaced by AI.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Open AAI's GBT is the most popular model by far which kind of makes sense because like Chad GBT is what most people think of when they think AI while sonnet being second which is kind of like the more popular option with like claude code and everything and Rust right here is the most admired language as it always is every single year people just want that speed baby. Now let's look at the bottom here for desired admired. I want to know that 1.3% of people who are like oh I just like desire it. [laughter] I need it. And again, Stack Overflow giving them a whole entire section here like frequency a few times per month, multiple times per day.

### 📝 詳細説明

And this section right here is really interesting with accuracy of AI tools. 3% have said they highly trust it, which you know, I definitely don't highly trust it either, but I definitely do somewhat trust it better than me, but then highly distrust. So, it's interesting to see how like it's still such a polarizing topic, especially amongst developers. What are [music] your thoughts? Do you agree or disagree with anything that these developers have said?

### 💡 実例・デモ

Let me know.
