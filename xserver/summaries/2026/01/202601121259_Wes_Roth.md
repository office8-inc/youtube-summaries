## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Welcome to the year 2026. We are entering the part of AI development that's uh basically this. Let me zoom in. This green line, that's a dumb human. This yellow line, that's Einstein.

### 📋 背景・概要

Right? So, basically, we're currently witnessing AI's ability kind of going across this line. And we're kind of slowly going from, oh, that's cute. That's adorable to WTF. So, you've probably seen announcements around this.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Basically, there's this very well-known mathematician. His name is Paul Erdish, I believe is the pronunciation, and basically has a collection of open math problems referred to as the Eddish problems. And he describes these problems as these acorns which require deep and subtle insights from which a mighty oak can develop. So, it's basically very difficult problems that have not been solved up to this point. They have not been solved by humans.

### 📝 詳細説明

That is the Erish problems. And currently there are 1,135 problems in the database and 40% of them have been solved. But here's what's happening right now. Like literally right now, within the last few days, AI autonomously solved one of these problems. And within the last few hours, it solved yet another one.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Now, you've probably seen a lot of announcements like this recently. Some of them seem like they're controversial. Some of them turn out to be wrong or overstated. So, I know a lot of us kind of just started ignoring the noise. This one as of right now, we're fairly confident it's legit.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

This is Terrence Tao. Considered by many as one of the greatest mathematicians living today. Currently, he's a professor at UCLA. He's considered to be the Mozart of mathematics. I pulled up some data from Gemini 3.

### 🎯 応用例

So, it sounds like at the age of two, he was teaching other children how to count using wooden blocks. He learned from Sesame Street and then at 2 years old was was teaching other kids to count. age nine taking university level math courses. Kind of a leap it seems but and by age of 10 he became the youngest person ever to compete in the international mathematical olympiad. Took him a couple years but by age 13 he won the IMO gold medal.

### 💭 考察

To this day he remains the youngest gold medalist in history. So again credible figure that we can kind of trust if he's if he thinks this is happening we can assume you know it's happening. I believe there are some reviews still going on and maybe we'll get some news back later, but at this point I think it's pretty reasonable to to call it. Here's what Terrence Ta saying. He's saying recently the application of AI tools to airish problems passed a milestone.

### 📌 まとめ

An airish problem number 728 was solved more or less autonomously by AI after some feedback from an initial attempt. In the spirit of the problem as reconstructed by the airish problem website community with the result to the best of our knowledge not replicated in existing literature although similar results proven by similar methods were located. So this is important because not replicated in existing literature. So there were some previous claims that these AI models ch I think solved some new thing or or provided some proof in reality just did some research found some proof online that somebody has has written and kind of reproduced it. this as as far as we can tell this is the real deal.

### ✅ 結論

So it it didn't find some previously existing solution elsewhere. It did so in the spirit of the problem as far as I can tell if I understand correctly in the original kind of a phrasing by air dish. there was some loophole like he didn't phrase it quite in such a way as to close all the loopholes basically allowing there to be a a trivial solution right so kind of if you were willing to kind of lawyer your way into it it's like oh well actually you forgot to do this so therefore you know this is a basic solution so assuming that's not the case assuming that airish didn't mean for that simple solution to exist that that cheat code solution you had to solve it in the proper way so to speak this AI did it in that fashion right so it didn't use a loophole. And finally, so this is a little bit cut off, but I think this is a very important thing to understand. So Terrence Tao is saying this is a demonstration of the genuine increase in capability of these tools in recent months.

### 📚 追加情報

So that's important to understand. It's recent months. He's not kidding. These are brand new results for from fairly brand new models. This is brand new territory that we're entering.

### 🔖 補足

This capability is new. That's why I started with that graph of that person kind of being shocked by how quickly those things shot up. By the way, Terrence did post his entire post on Mastadon which is here. I'll have a link down below if you read it and and we'll look at at another part here that I think is interesting. We'll come back to that because he's specifically talking about as he says a a story which he finds more interesting than the solution itself which is the emerging AI powered capability to rapidly write and rewrite expositions of the solution.

### 🎨 セクション 13

All right. So, January 7th, AI solves a problem number 728. So, fun times, but wait, there's more. This is Neil Somi. So, he's a QR at Citadel.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, he's doing a quantitative research at, you know, this large investing trading firm. So, again, one of the higherend math guys, if you will. He had some time over the weekend, it seems. So, he's saying we can't win. The proof I submitted to air dishes problem number 397 was accepted by Terrence Tao.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Again, that's not the same problem we were just talking about. That was a 728. This is a 397. All right. So, over the weekend, another problem got cracked and accepted by Terence Tao.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, Neil continues, "The proof was generated by GPT 5.2 Pro and formalized with harmonic." Many open problems are sitting there waiting for someone to prompt Chad GPT to solve them. How crazy is that? This seems like it's, you know, not priced in, if you will. I don't think people are fully grasping what this means, right? we we all have this chat GPT or whatever other LLM the chatbot is in front of us and slowly over time they're getting a little bit smarter and smarter and now they're at a point where you know like he says here there's there's many open problems that we have as humans right those problems that we haven't been able to solve for 50 years specifically the the best and brightest people mathematicians weren't able to solve for 50 years and now if we plug it in to that little chatbot that just sat there getting smarter all of a sudden it can crack those problems Greg Brock from OpenAI jumps in saying great work.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So Neil is saying that only GPT 5.2 Pro was able to do it. By the way, a few weeks ago, this is around Christmas time 2025. This person, I wasn't following this too too much, so I apologize if I miss some details. So this is David Button, and he posted that he believed that he could solve the Navier Stokes Millennium Prize, meaning that he had a solution to the Navier Stokes smoothness and existence problem. Marcus Hutter bet $10,000 that David Budnet will not solve the Navier Stokes a million problem, right?

### 📋 セクション 18

So that you know this is the uh manifold of markets everybody's betting. So a lot of people were saying that this person David is suffering from LM psychosis. So he basically talked to these LLMs long enough to where it convinced him that he found some magical solution and he's kind of like losing it. Those are the things that people were suggesting. So I'm not 100% sure what's happening with this bet.

### ⭐ セクション 19

I mean the bet was lost, but it seems like he's still working on the problem. So no clue what's happening there. But we did in just a few weeks ago from you know this man that thinks that an an LLM solved some mathematical equation or some math problem like obviously he's crazy you right that that was a few weeks ago to now where no of course it's true as confirmed by you know people at Duke QR at Citadel one of the greatest still living mathematicians of all time and you know a lot of people in the mathematics community the airish problem community etc are all kind of confirming this In fact, yes, recently AI's crossed that threshold. But here's yet another thing that kind of I think illustrates where we are. So this is Terrence Tao's GitHub page.

### 📝 セクション 20

He's got a specific section where he talks about the AI contributions to air dissue problems. He's got multiple kind of categories here. So one is AI generated solutions, partial solutions or negative results for previously open problems. Right? So the red is where the LM produced an incorrect result.

### 💡 セクション 21

It's funny they're using CHP, the free version here. So maybe that's why I don't know. Interestingly, Alpha Evolve. So that was Google's model. It had a slight improvement to a past construction, right?

### 🔧 セクション 22

So it's a partial solution. That's an improvement. Notice the dates on this. So this is the end of 2025. Chad PZ 5.2 in, you know, just a few days ago in 2026 had a partial solution to problem number 486.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Alpha Evolve at the end of 2025 had a, you know, they're calling it a partial solution to problem 507. And actually this, I believe, was the first air dish problem solved by, you know, ChadBt or an LM. This was a 728. Few days later, we had 729. The one solved by Neil using NinjaT 5.2 Pro, that was number 397.

### 💭 セクション 24

That's not even in here yet, as far as I can tell. So, this hasn't been updated yet. But notice there's like this wave, like this wall that is just, you know, beginning to solve these problems. Yes, some of them are wrong. Some of them are partial solutions, but we're seeing them fully solved.

### 📌 セクション 25

In some cases, we have three fully solved problems. Actually, four now, right? With the new problem that was solved, if that gets accepted, that would be four if I understand correctly. Notice mainly it's CHAGBT 5.2 often 5.2 Pro. That's the one that's really driving a lot of these solutions.

### ✅ セクション 26

And again, note the dates, right? It's November and December 2025 and January 2026. So, just the last few months. So, GBT 5.2 2 officially came out in December 11th, 2025. So exactly 30 days ago was probably available for research use before that.

### 📚 セクション 27

So I think we can say that's the first model that is able to make a dent in these unproven unsolved math problems. Then we have kind of another category. So these are fully AI generated solutions to problems that were thought open but for which an earlier human solution was was found. Right? So NLM solves it but then later they're like oh actually a human solved it previously.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So they list the number of them. So so this is meaningful but we just maybe we don't know if Chad GBT found some information online found that proof and then used it or it was in its data somehow or it was it was completely new. Notice here they're they're asking is it similar proofs and in these two cases yes. So here maybe it was you know copied or somehow they used the existing proof to write their own. But this one it says no.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So it seems like it's a completely different approach. And we have a third category. These are AI generated tools applied to problems previously known to be solved or partially solved. And notice here in some of these cases using things like alpha proof, for example, we're finding new proofs. So we we had an existing one from 1975, but the AI found a new way of doing it and there are a a number of those.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So the green circles means that it's completely new. And we also have the category number four, solutions generated by humans in collab with AI. By the way, here they're only talking about the air dish problems as far as I can tell. We've seen some other examples of people doing work in other fields in math, but you know, not underneath these set of problems that credited in that case, I believe it was a GPT, maybe not 5.2 because it was early in the year, but maybe it was one of the earlier versions of the GPT. Specifically, I'm referring to Scott Aronson's.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Here's his post. This was in September of 2025. And so so you can read it for yourself because there's some you know asterisks there. But here's the important line here. He's saying this is the first paper I've ever put out for which a key technical step in the proof of the main result came from AI specifically from GPT5 thinking.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Okay. So that's yet another example. Then category number five problems with AI powered literature review. And there's a few green circles here as well as you can see quite a bit actually and a lot of yellows. Six is proofs that were formalized by AI and we have all of these here and seven human solutions with some with some secondary AI tool uses.

### 🎬 セクション 33

There was a few here as well and some other ones. But the point, you know, as I scroll up, notice the dates, right? It's all either beginning of 2026 or very end of 2025. You know, here's where a human used some tool use. I mean, we're specifically talking more about like the brand new discoveries, right?

### 📋 セクション 34

All of these, right? AI generated solutions, autonomous solutions. notice it's all either late November, December 2025 or you know the first few weeks of this year 2026. So this is brand brand new brand new capabilities. We didn't have this 3 months ago.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Briefly coming back to Trent's house post here as he's saying here you know in the beginning he said that this problem was solved more or less autonomously by AI but deeper in here he's talking about you know something different. He's saying, "But to me, the more interesting capability revealed by these events is the ability to rapidly write and rewrite new versions of a text as it needed. Even if one was not the original author of the argument." So, even if AI wasn't able to autonomously discover new things, just the ability for it to be used kind of like Photoshop for math, I guess. I'm not sure what the exact analogy is, but there's tons of tools that make it easier for, let's say, you're a photographer or graphics designer. There's stuff that makes it easier for you to do your job.

### 📝 セクション 36

you're able to create templates and create layers at a different layers. So if you have an image, you don't have to start each one from scratch. Excel is another example, right? If you change one formula, a lot of times there's logic that updates how that's reflected throughout the sheet. With a lot of these math papers, if I understand correctly, right?

### 💡 セクション 37

If somebody gives you some feedback about one particular thing that might impact other portions of the paper, the poor professor, the poor mathematician has to completely basically like rewrite everything and update everything. Basically, there's a lot of work that can be automated by LLMs. That would be very helpful to mathematicians, even if it's not generating brand new solutions. It just allows for automation of the mindnumbingly boring difficult tasks that that can be automated. If you never saw the movie Moneyball, it's actually a pretty good movie.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Basically, this math nerd goes into baseball back in the days when they didn't really use a statistical analysis. They didn't really use advanced calculations to figure stuff out. you just had kind of old school coaches looking at players, seeing how they do, and just kind of going with their gut. And he was able to use kind of the statistics, the math to see a lot of things that were hidden if you weren't kind of parsing it through with math, if you were just trying kind of to observe it. So there's this idea of being able to quantify stuff, whether that's, you know, athletes or or stocks, interest, industries, economies, etc.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Math is the underlying kind of foundational level to a lot of the universe. Him coming in, this one person with with a computer, some coding skills, and some understanding of, you know, statistics comes in and basically flips the entire sport on its head because he's able to see strategies and make decisions that that other people can't even comprehend. They're just not able to see what he is able to see. And we've seen this happen in a lot of other industries, right? Investments.

### 💭 セクション 40

I actually got kind of curious. The point is when math comes for certain industries, those industries are transformed, right? Finance is an obvious one. The rise of the quants, right? Before 1970s, trading was dominated by intuition tips and fundamental analysis.

### 📌 セクション 41

Right? We're studying the company's business model. Now, a lot of that is obviously disrupted because we tend to use math and quantitative analysis, quantitative research to make decisions about the movement of markets. We can create algorithmic trading, etc. Logistics was a big one.

### ✅ セクション 42

There's a lot of people that in the 90s, I think, started using machine learning to try to figure out what are the best routes for delivery vans to get to where they were going with the least amount of time and fuel used. And then drivers would follow those routes. One of the biggest things that they discovered is you never want to turn left. You know, if you're driving on the right side of the road, you want to take right turns wherever possible. So if you're laying out a route and you can and you can eliminate as many left turns as possible, that route is likely going to be much much more efficient.

### 📚 セクション 43

Agriculture and precision farming, politics, you know, campaign resource optimization, etc. Dating got turned into an algorithm. Ads, this was a huge one for me because back in the days I used to work doing online ads. You would design pages and test conversion rates, right? You would split test different versions of it.

### 🔖 セクション 44

You would buy traffic, buy media from a big online sources, put them to your website and see if you can convert them into a sale. And I saw this firsthand because there were people that used to do marketing, you know, for 50 years and they kind of had, oh, like I know this stuff. I have a gut feeling about it. And working that field, I I quickly realized that most of the time they had no clue what they were talking about. It was a coin toss.

### 🎨 セクション 45

The way to figure out what ads would work or what layout would work, what pricing would work would be to test it. tested on actual customers because that gave you real statistically relevant results that you could trust that they were going to work moving forward not just some hunch or guess. So that means that when we take smart people and you know we give them some math abilities right we teach them some math we give them you know calculators and excel spreadsheets computers whatever right they tend to optimize certain industries disrupt certain industries figure out how to do stuff better and of course understanding of math kind of goes up over time. Our ability to produce better machines and calculators and computers goes up over time. The number of humans smart humans is very limited but it also tends to go up over time.

### 🚀 セクション 46

And so our ability to sort of quant the world sort of has been improving over time, right? Understanding of math, better technology, etc. Right? So over time, this might have been our ability for for humans to improve various technology and industries, etc. Over time by by using math and here comes AI, specifically these neural nets and and so for a long time, they weren't as good as humans at doing that.

### ⚡ セクション 47

You always needed a human in the loop. They might have been useful tools, but they weren't able to autonomously drive research understanding forward. And then right about now, in the last few months, it kind of went like this, it seems. I don't know if you say that these models are necessarily better than humans, but we're seeing the beginning of this transition to where these models are at least as good as the world's best mathematicians, maybe are even getting better in some ways. But here's the thing.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Here's the kind of big difference, the important thing to grasp about AI. When we compare human mathematicians researchers versus AI researchers, let's assume they're equal in their abilities, right? We're not even saying AI is better. We're not even looking at that. Let's let's say they're equal.

### 🎬 セクション 49

With AI, we can run a million copies. We can't clone a human just, you know, Ctrl V, a bunch of smart researchers. We can with these large language models. There's there's a cost, electricity, GPUs, etc. But you can infinitely clone them.

### 📋 セクション 50

They work 247 without getting tired. They might even work at faster speeds than humans. 10x, 100x, who knows? These machines can read every paper ever written. Like just imagine if they can just read every paper that was ever written in the field of math, maybe even every blog post or or book or or anything written by mathematicians.

### ⭐ セクション 51

That ability to kind of see the entire playing field and maybe kind of synthesize ideas would be in of itself a pretty powerful thing. They can of course write tons of proofs and modifications, expand all all the stuff that we have like expand how well it's organized, explained. They can write whatever code is needed to run experiments. And all of this comes from just one model, right? So like right now most of the progress came from GPT 5.2 that we've seen with these air dish problems.

### 📝 セクション 52

So it's not like every single lab has to produce the greatest mathematical model of all time. We just need one, right? You have one, you make a million copies. It runs 24/7 at 10x the speed of a human researcher. It has access to all of the human data.

### 💡 セクション 53

It can create entire libraries of text that can access and run experiments, etc. So that's something to think about as let's say this red line is our AI progress, the abilities of these AI models, right? It's kind of going past the abilities of your average intelligence human. and it's rapidly approaching and in many ways already exceeding that of a high intelligence human at least in the areas that it's kind of trained for, right? It's getting really good at coding.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's getting really good at math. So, as it's doing that, right, there's going to be a lot of industries that are going to be impacted just like the the previous industries that were impacted by quants, just like we talked about. That might mean some scary developments. Think about, for example, that being applied to something like lawsuits, right? Each lawsuit becomes almost like a stock or an asset that is quantifiable by risk and cost and ROI.

### 🎯 セクション 55

I mean, that's kind of scary to think about, right? Maybe there's going to be some firm out there that's utilizing AI just to find the highest reward, lowest risk lawsuits and then either taking on themselves or just providing that service to the lawyers, right? Hey, here's a basket of cases that have a very high chance of netting you millions with a little work and low risk of failing and just just selling that data to the lawyers. I mean, that could really mess up the legal system. There's tons of places where it can be much much better with medicine, for example, the ability to kind of doing that n equals one trials and optimizing for each person's unique chemistry based on their blood work and, you know, genome, etc.

### 💭 セクション 56

That could be huge. Right now, we have no idea if our specific metabolism and agenic structure. Maybe we shouldn't be eating certain foods or doing certain things that are bad for us. And just a few tweaks might make us a lot healthier and better, but we have no idea. The data is probably out there.

### 📌 セクション 57

There's just no way to kind of sort it and comb it and give it to people in actionable little bites. With infrastructure, it will completely, I think, revolutionize everything. Just think about how we construct things. There's probably a million different ways in which our buildings and designs aren't efficient because we have to have highly paid humans working on them. What if it was very fast and cheap to create efficient designs for for homes, for energy grids, for every single part on a car or on a house or anything, anything, anything.

### ✅ セクション 58

What if those designs could be improved? What if your mask could be 15% better and your steering wheel 10% better? What if every single thing that you see out in the world that's technology that's humanmade can be made more more efficient, more durable with better materials, whatever that means, we just don't have enough sort of cumulative brake capacity across the entire world to think deeply about every single tiny little design decision that people make. These AIs might change that. It might be cheap intelligence for every process that we run.

### 📚 セクション 59

And of course, it will also apply to all of the industries that we've talked about to to finance to logistics to ads and agriculture and baseball and just everything everything. So anyways, wild times ahead. We are here and uh it's getting interesting. Don't sleep on this. If you made it this far, thank you so much for watching.
