## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Just like we've seen Vibe coding and Vibe automation, we now have Vibe editing, which is such good news for anyone wanting to build businesses and make money online. So, in this video, I wanted to bring on Simon, good friend of mine, who's been absolutely at the cutting edge of this new trend to show us what Remotion is, how it works, and how to set it up for yourself so that you can start editing your own videos using Claude Code in just a few minutes. I hope you enjoy. Simon, mate, great to see you and excited to get into this. You've been absolutely uh blowing my mind with some of the stuff you've been sending through the group chat.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, wanted to bring you on and uh break down how you can use clawed code to uh with the combination of Remotion to be able to generate videos uh as if you had a a really good editor on your team. So, this is a absolutely cutting edge stuff and I can't wait to get into it. >> It's actually nuts the things people have been cooking up like I have some demos very recently right here. Like now you can literally even make Hey Gen and Remotion. So, you can get your own AI avatar.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

You can have motion graphics happening in the background and all of this just by you prompting. So technically you don't even need to be in front of the screen anymore and there's like cool explainers on the side. But you know people have been making like really cool stuff as well. Like for example this one where it's actually let's say nano banana or cling you can make videos with those and from them you can use reotion to stitch them all together and make really cinematic shots and videos as well right and then people have also been using it to do simple stuff like this is for the accelerator we built with one prompt it even found your name your logo and stuff like that and you know make these fun little motion explainers as well. >> Cool.

### 📝 詳細説明

Yeah. And so this has all been made possible through rem reotion which is what like a plugin. What do you even describe it as? >> Remotion is basically a service that makes video editing or generating any components or any motion graphics into code. And because Claude, especially the Opus 4.5 model, is so good at generating code, it can take advantage of this new Remotion service and create any videos you want just by you prompting it.

### 💡 実例・デモ

>> Right. that's starting to make a bit of sense. But like, so we have the raw elements of a video, right? Say it's the it's the the footage of like an A-roll of say this a YouTube video that I'm filming or it's uh the animations that go on top, it's the the music, the sound effects. Is all of that stuff taken care of here or is it mainly just for basically I have some video files.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I can now play around with them programmatically and determine how they get kind of stitched together. And how does it handle layering on top? So say I have footage on the background like that space scene. How does it then put animations on top of that? >> Yeah.

### 🎯 応用例

So ultimately if you think about it um what are the video editors doing right and video editors in the back end is just code. So what you can do with reotion is when you set up a cloud project let's say you dump in all your let's say your a-roll your other uh stat uh other assets like for example here um like it actually just like scraped Liam's your Liam your face and your stuff and put it in there. So it can actually take these things from inside your project because claude can you know see your assets and embed it where you need to. So for example, let's say you have a video of yourself here like this hijen one. You could just be like hey can put me on the right and what remotion does is give yourself the positioning and layering so you can put yourself on the right or wherever you need to.

### 💭 考察

It's essentially like a codebased video editor if you think about it. Remotion that's all that is. Okay guys, very quickly. If you're an aspiring entrepreneur and wants to start your own AI business and you haven't already joined my free school community, it's down there in one of the links in the description below. Has my full free course on how to start your own AI agency as a complete beginner.

### 📌 まとめ

And you're surrounded by over a quarter million people who are also striving towards the same things. There's no better place on the planet right now to be surrounded by like-minded people. And you get free weekly Q&A with me where you can ask questions directly to me about how to start and scale your business. I'll see you in there. So, is there any other theory we need to know before we like jump into into playing around with this?

### ✅ 結論

Only other theory we need to know is there are some best practices into using it. And the way we do that is by teaching Claude a skill. And what a skill kind of is and how it works is essentially like this. Um Liam, hopefully you're also a big fan of Pokemon like I am. >> Yeah, this makes sense.

### 📚 追加情報

>> Yeah. So, what we're kind of doing is like right here in Pokemon when we need to, let's say, get through water or get through a tree, we would teach our Pokemon a skill like cut or surf, right? In the same way, you can teach Claude other skills like, "Hey, here's your video editing skill, and you're going to be using Remotion to do that, right?" So, we teach them the skill and then after Claude learns the skill, it can start doing these things. And it's really easy to, for example, like this TM install these skills because it's kind of like if you've ever played GTA, it's kind of like you just having to enter a cheat code into Claude and then it kind of just learned the skill on its own. >> It's just a command uh that we can run to add the skill to Claude and that's it on screen.

### 🔖 補足

>> Exactly. That's it. So, um, just if you want to make it easier, Liam, I'll send it to you so you can give it to these guys. Um, these are what you just need to enter into Claude and it will just learn all of it, right? And, you know, we can get into actually building one live.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, it's going to be a lot easier to follow along. And you know when we want to build this stuff all we have to do just because and this is why it's so cool is because the barrier of entry is getting lower and lower because all you would have to do is just go to your cloud desktop app and type into this little chat box and that's all you need to do. So let me start doing that. I just opened up claw desktop. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to make a new folder and I'm going to call this folder let's say remotion Liam.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I'm going create this and open it. So, what we're doing right here is we're kind of telling Claude to build any videos that it needs to or whatever it needs to do in here. So, you're actually really focused. And if you're curious how to get here is all you need to do is when you're in the Cloud app, you just hit this code button and you're good to go. That's all you need to do.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, this is just an easier way of using cloud code. All right. And then what we want to do is I'm just going to move this one second. And I'm going to grab this thing right here. All right.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Right here. I'm going to paste this. And this is a skill. So now it gets really easy. This was the hard part.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Now I'm just going to speak to Claude like, "Hey, um, I'm trying to create a video for Liam's AAA accelerator. Can you go out to the web? Can you search for Liam's AAA accelerator, get all his colors, branding, and all that, and then make an explainer video on what it really is. But first, before you do that, I want you to install the skill I have for you above and then with Remotion, I want you to create that project and give it to me. All right.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, after I did that, uh there is I had this ask thing because there's ask, code, and plan. And intentionally I was really vague with this prompt. So I want to see where it messes up if it does. But right here after I just put it to code so it doesn't ask me for random stuff. And then I'm just going to hit go.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And then I'm going to trust this workspace. And you see it just all it does it just asks you for permission over and over. So first it installs the reotion skill. Boom. Installation failed.

### 📝 セクション 20

Okay cool. And now it's going to keep doing it trying new stuff. >> Damn. So this is I guess the move for with it like the the clawed codification of of everything which is kind of what we're going through here for startups to be able to create some functionality that builds on top of or gives a very powerful new use case to claude code I suppose is the move but I suppose there's only a certain number of these major areas like this that are that are yet to be tapped right so the video editing being one I guess you got uh image gen video again. Um, obviously got the code side of things already, document creation.

### 💡 セクション 21

Um, is this the new move for startups? >> Honestly, yeah. So, the reason why all these AI models like Claude, GPT, Gemini, they invest so heavily into code and their models being able to code stuff. It's it's the reason is essentially because if you can code, you can technically do everything on a computer, right? Because everything on the computer is ones and zeros is just code.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And if you can get that good enough, you can just have autonomous people like like what we're doing with our hands and and our keyboards and eyes. You can do that and get your computer to do ultimately anything you want. So yeah, that's pretty much it. You just learn cloud code. You just learn to prompt a little bit and you're good to go.

### 🎯 セクション 23

>> I mean, the the future of like SAS and software is an interesting one as well. like building a SAS and future does come down to depending on if you actually need to access the interface or not. But it's like creating these functions or external like specific things that a user can do once logged in and they can go to set up their account but the interface becomes whatever whether it's claude code or or co-work or this new interface where we're doing everything from or or chatbt and kind of like how we had chatbt plugins like forever ago and that that seemed to be like the direction it would move. seems like we've finally come full circle on on that being the case where as a as a software uh like a SAS platform, you want to be able to build a key a set of key functionalities that can plug into this and then people won't actually be using it on your site. They'll just be paying for the subscription for cloud to be able to hook into it.

### 💭 セクション 24

That's actually really good point because like A6 A16Z they have been investing really heavily into the the future of the web and they kind of see it as being kind of aic. So for example like right now to buy a plane ticket um for our Africa uh South Africa event Liam um I would have to go to Google flights find the best flights and then go buy it right what A16Z is predicting is the future of the web is more agentic based so they won't be building UIs and stuff anymore but more so like creating websites and apps so that other agents can use them and the reason they're doing that is because that's kind of what's happening right No, I don't really care as long as I get my output. I just tell my AI agent, "Hey, go find me the cheapest tickets and then I'll go do it." If you're a business owner who's interested in what Generative AI can do for your business, you can get in touch with me and my team at Morning.AI in one of the links in the description below and we can start your entire AI transformation process going all the way from the education and training of your staff to the identification of the best AI use cases for your company all the way through to development and beyond. We have worked with some of the world's biggest sports teams and also publicly traded companies. So, rest assured, you are in good hands.

### 📌 セクション 25

>> Yeah. And I guess what we are missing is the say in this case for the editing use case until Claude code or co-work and things like this have a a video player that allows us to maybe tweak around the timeline and things like this the very finetuning uh parts of it. >> It's just a matter of time until they add in the layers and layers of UI that are needed. Yeah. To do these to to do this kind of stuff.

### ✅ セクション 26

>> So yeah. So I was actually playing with this a while back. So you see this is how it gets generated right. >> So this is on remotion itself. This is >> Yes, this is Remotion.

### 📚 セクション 27

Oh, this is like a voice over, but this is Remotion running locally. And you see there is a little video editor that you can mess with. Um, you can render your videos. And then there's even like a little place for your assets. So, right here, you'll see, you know, this is your logo.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Uh, this is, you know, uh, this is you. It went and scraped all of it. I didn't do any of this. And then there's a voice over. >> So, it stitched all these together.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Uh, to when you mentioned the assets for the videos, this is just just about it. It keeps it here. It uses the assets to generate the videos. And you know, if you really want, you can get in and then adjust the nitty-gritty of it. But you can also do that by just prompting.

### 🚀 セクション 30

I always think back to like the uh the instantly use case. If you're setting up like a a cold email campaign, >> like what's at a certain point, what is the actual value of me going onto the platform and making like a dozen clicks to set up a new campaign? I should be able to have my my clawude console kind of workspace here and saying, "Hey, let's look at the marketing number that numbers that have come back from the last campaign. Let's look at the new strategy that we're rolling out for this quarter. Let me pull that data.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Let me look at the strategy. Let me come up with a new strategy. Plan out a whole new campaign, new copy for the emails, new AB test planning, and then just use like a an instantly tool or integration to be able to set up that campaign and basically give the all clear on it all from just in the chat interface. So the the SAS platform becomes like the power of of instantly would be that it can uh push those cold email campaigns at at scale and provide you with the uh the email sending like domains and accounts. It's really fun that you mentioned that because we were actually in the middle of and this is done through like these connectors and MCPs and we were literally in the middle of building for our platform booked in an MCP and we were experimenting with this but like now what we were doing is just literally being like build me a voice agent for this company and then it goes up does it and then call them like every day and then it does it too.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So all these little things are being automated but it's still going to be up to you to know which software has the best opinions. Oh, I think it's done. Uh, but which software has the best opinion that you want to follow? Okay, so this video looks like Oh, it's still going, but uh let's see. It might die.

### 🎬 セクション 33

AAA accelerator. I guess you didn't use your colors this time, but >> complete business blueprint. >> Yeah, I mean, this is like a oneshot prompt cuz I made it, you know, learn the skill and do it. Maybe it's messing up, but I'm actually impressed that in one prompt without me even >> Oh, no, no, no. It's It's getting it.

### 📋 セクション 34

It got mixed up. As you can see there, 280K. That's my free community. So, it must have got >> mixed up in the in the process and like taken the the free community information, but thought that it was the the accelerator. >> Yeah, probably.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I mean, I just told it, hey, go scrape uh Liam's aa accelerator. I didn't even wasn't even very specific. So, >> okay. And so what does it look like to edit it from there? If we were to say, um, hey, just change the change the text from AAA accelerator to AI automation agency hub, which is what my free community is called.

### 📝 セクション 36

>> You just do that and say, hey, can you change the text from AAA accelerator to AI? Sorry, what did you say again? AI automation agency hub. Okay, let's see. Let me just be a little more uh specific.

### 💡 セクション 37

Liam has two communities. Can you make this to make sure there is no AAA accelerator mentioned here? more so AI automation agency hub for Liam. Um if you want also like these things you can change you can just be like hey on can you change the text here >> uh screenshot if we just take a screenshot of that and chuck it in be like can we change number three to scale to $1 billion a month >> and for this scene can you make sure it says scale to $1 billion a month. >> Uh that's a nice claim.

### 🔧 セクション 38

>> Yeah I'm sure I won't get in trouble for that one. Yeah, then now it's also going to, you know, go ahead. It's going to do its thing. Um, and yeah, the stuff. >> What are the the use cases for this then?

### 🎯 セクション 39

Either as a just a personal productivity or like another skill, say like the whole AI generalist thing that I've talked about. It's it's another skill that you as an individual can have power to now create uh video edits like you have a I don't know 2 three years experience in in video editing. Is this just another personal skill that you can add on or is there the the opportunity to to turn it into a service and make money with it? >> It's kind of a bit of both. So, you can definitely use it for yourself.

### 💭 セクション 40

Like I actually I think it was yesterday I released this video and I edited the whole thing with Remotion. It just took me prompting here and there. I generated all the motion graphics and everything. So, for your own lead genen, you can use it to create your own videos and you can use hgen like the one uh example we saw before. But if you want to take it a step further, if you're an AI agency, imagine SAS companies, they probably want like product videos.

### 📌 セクション 41

Imagine marketing agencies, they probably want like um videos of their product. Like ecom agencies, you can use Remotion to insert those assets and be like, "Hey, I just made you this really cool ad. Do you want to do you want like an ad every day for the next 30 days and you pay me x dollars?" >> Okay. So, if we like think about it from like a I think these like workspaces are really where it's where it's going. So, say you're you wanted to start a service for a certain you could go direct to an ecom client perhaps um who's running their own ads or you go to an agency and you're you set up a workspace for one of their clients.

### ✅ セクション 42

So, you have a folder for one of their clients and in there is like all of the product with their their photos and sorted by into folders and you've got the names of the products in the folders and therefore you can like reference, hey, create an ad for this and then you've got their brand pack which has got the colors and their website branding and so on. It's got a text document that has all the information on their brand guidelines and and stylistic decisions like typography um the exact hex codes of their brand colors and so on. And then you could brainstorm within uh claude code itself and maybe have like a like a plan out a new ad creative and it will take in into account all of that information it has there. It might be able to pick out that particular product, reference that in the plan and then be able to generate a new video ad based off that plan. Correct.

### 📚 セクション 43

Yeah, definitely. That becomes just like, you know, it becomes your creativity and your workflow. Whatever workflow you're doing, if there's anything where you need to kind of like change your graphics around or edit a video, you can just add this in and get it done for you. And it makes it a lot easier uh to essentially just build these motion graphics cuz you know, the one I showed you was very rudimentary. I didn't put a system.

### 🔖 セクション 44

>> How crazy how crazy can we push these motion graphics? At the moment, >> you can make fullon basically product demos. I think you have one one from Booked in, right? >> I have one for book 10. Yes.

### 🎨 セクション 45

>> Meet Bookedin, your complete AI powered sales engagement platform. Let's take a quick tour of what makes Booked in so powerful. >> Uh, I'll just show you this. So, for example, right here, what it does is I have my UI and I put it in the same folder as my Remotion thing, right? So it grabbed my assets from my UI and built this this whole uh generation with my UI components in mind.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So in the same way kind of reotion uh right here maybe they made a better one. You just need to prompt it more. But see you can have those kind of swivels going up and down. Uh I think there's more. Uh >> well so I assume they've done all of this.

### ⚡ セクション 47

>> Yes, they have done there's so many things that are going on. There's like map animations that people are making. You're kind it kind of like the world you're see this one is also made with reotion if you can see this like this map world animation this 3D yeah so it's kind of it's your creativity oh by the way I think the thing is done uh right here >> let's have a look uh I guess I just skipped ahead and so I could get provide information on which 11 Labs voice to use here so I've got my own voice it can generate and what about generating images and and extra footage on the fly. Scale to 1 billion a month. There we go.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Great. [laughter] And so you can just add in logos into the assets file there and it'll be able to start inserting those there as well. >> Exactly. Yeah. Anything you want like like I don't know if you saw in the other one, it literally used your face.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So, so the more the more I can stack into this project file, whether it's like photos of my team, photos of me, photos of like successful people, a bit of like success stories and information about each success story, like the more stuff I can just jam into all those folders, the more freedom it has to like be creative with those and make better looking visuals. Yeah, I I will still say the creative shouldn't be the AI, the creative should be you. So, um, have you seen that Rick R, uh, what was it? Rick Rubin, his, um, clip where he's like, "I don't know how to play a music. Uh, I don't know how to play the instrument." >> Yeah.

### 📋 セクション 50

But he just knows taste and that's all you need to be. >> Yep. Love it. Sweet, bro. Uh, what was the other I think you have a few more things on the board.

### ⭐ セクション 51

>> Yeah. So, I want to make sure like uh you saw like one of the easier things you can do with we were just making like really fun, you know, just product demos or videos right now. But you can also stack skills, right? And what stacking skills is, so for example, uh if you saw in this video right here, this is all realistic images. This is not the type of product demo that we were making.

### 📝 セクション 52

And how this this one is done is by essentially making a bunch of let's say Sora 2 or V3 videos and then stitching them together. So when you're thinking of Remotions, just make a folder. Let's say you have a bunch of clips. Just be like, "Hey, dump it in and be like, "Hey, organize these for me. Put them together, put some music on it, and it'll get that done." >> Well, okay.

### 💡 セクション 53

But what if I was wanting to do more of the workflow there and I I have say I'm working from a brief and it's like I need to make a a interstellar themed uh sequence that's going to sort of dramatically promote X product. Can it help me to I guess using just the general like writing ability of claw code and and the the clawed models to plan that out into a plan and then be able to take those prompts and pass it into a video generator and then I get those files back within the within the workspace. Right now what you can do is like let's say you want a product demo that's in the interstellar theme. What you can do is give it the assets and it'll basically layer it on top. So it'll generate the nanobanana pro images and you know that can basically create anything right.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So you create those and then you take those and then make uh videos out of that. So for example, you can take nanobanana pictures and then put it into an AI image video model like V3 or cling and it makes that video and then it stitches it together in reotion. So what I'm trying to say is like you see right here there's some like assets like scenes. It would take the AI video and let's say place it here and it can even layer this stuff on top like these little things. >> Cir.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And you can just prompt your way to whatever the whatever motion graphics you want over your over your A-roll. >> Exactly. Yeah. You can you can use any A-roll, any assets you need. It's just, you know, getting the taste and the creativity out from yourself.

### 💭 セクション 56

It's basically just a video editor that you can prompt. That's that's all Remotion is. But the nice part is that, you know, you can also just like with cloud code point it at your assets as well. So you can make branded everything in your own theme. So the thing you mentioned with the marketing brief, if you had that, what you would have to do is put it inside the claw.md and the claw.md would make it consistent and always use that style or what you're trying to do.

### 📌 セクション 57

>> Okay. So for someone who's looking to to get started with this probably for I don't know their own content creation. Maybe they're trying to make some YouTube videos or maybe they're trying to market their own their own product and they want to make sort of a a demo video for it or something. So it's just getting their uh clawed workspace set up basically whatever you are. Do you recommend using the the uh desktop application or is it actually better to just use it directly in like in VS Code with a uh claw code in the terminal?

### ✅ セクション 58

>> Depends on your level of experience. I feel like if you're just starting out 100% just go to cloud desktop and then just use the the code from here because it makes everything like the same as claude. But if you're a bit more advanced, then if you do use VS Code, you can just see all the assets on the side and it's a lot easier to manage, right? It's just, you know, baby steps into getting into it. So if you're brand new, just use Cloud Desktop.

### 📚 セクション 59

If you're a bit more advanced and you know how VS Code works, maybe use cloud code through that. That's awesome. Thank you so much for sharing. I'm definitely going to have a play around with this and get my my edit team working on it cuz um they've been waiting for something like this for a while. But it's incredible this like claude code explosion we're seeing.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Um, and it's it's kind of scary to think where things are going to be in 12 months from now, but appreciate you coming on, bro. And um, hopefully have you back on soon for soon for some more source because um, this this is obviously just scratching the surface and um, I'm sure you'll be pushing the limits of this over the next while. So S is absolute legend, guys. If you want to check out his channel, he's dropping a whole lot of source on this exact method on his channel over there. Um, but you got anything uh, any last minute words, mate?

### 🎨 セクション 61

>> Yeah guys, this cloud code space is absolutely blowing up. Like literally, I bought this Mac Mini right here so I can like build these videos and marketing assets on the fly on my phone. So, keep looking into it. Just play around, have fun, and you know, you'll be good to take that and sell it to anyone when it's when they require it. So, with that, thanks for having me, Liam.

### 🚀 セクション 62

>> No worries, mate. And, uh, yeah, thanks guys for watching. So, that is all for this episode of the podcast, guys. If you want to see something similar that I really think you'd like, you can click up here to watch another one. And remember, if you think you have a story worth telling and some valuable insight you can share with the community, you can fill out my podcast application form in the description below.

### ⚡ セクション 63

I'd love to have a chat with you and get some exposure for your business. Aside from that, guys, that's all for the video. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next
