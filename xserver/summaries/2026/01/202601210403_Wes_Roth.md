## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness. Come on, slow resation to the end. Always the end, always the end. So when we found we could not make sense. Well, you said that we would still be friends.

### 📋 背景・概要

But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over. It was over. I don't even need your love. You treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. No, you did so long.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Cut your brace. Guess that I need that. Now you're just somebody that I used to know.
