## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Starting an AI business in 2026 and building your dream life has never been easier, even if you have no coding, AI, or business experience. And I know this because I literally have the data to prove it. I run the world's largest AI business community with over 270,000 members. I also run an accelerator where we've launched over 4,000 AI businesses in just the past 2 years. And every year, my team and I pull all the data from all of our coaching calls and all of our wins channels as well.

### 📋 背景・概要

And we're essentially tracking what people are selling, how much they're making, and how fast they're getting clients. Basically, what's actually working in the AI business space right now. And in this video, I'm showing you what that data says about starting an AI business in 2026, such as the two best business models that are working for people from all backgrounds, the simple method that complete AI newbies are using to land their first client in 9 days on average, the top selling AI offers that are getting people anywhere from 10,000 to $50,000 per deal, and how to start with zero AI business or coding experience. And I know that sounds like a big promise, but remember, I do have the data to back it up. So, here's the plan for the video.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Firstly, I'll explain the simple AI business model that is seeing the most success and explaining why. Then, we'll dive into the data, what's actually working for beginners starting these businesses in 2026. Then, I'll outline the two proven paths to 10K per month. One for nontechnical people and one for builders who don't want to sell. And in the final chapter of this video, I'll be giving you the exact steps to start this week in just a few hours a day.

### 📝 詳細説明

And before we jump into things, if you are new to the channel and don't know who I am, my name is Lee Molley and just 3 years ago, I had zero AI experience. And this year, my business is on track to do over $10 million in revenue. And my clients include publicly traded companies and even an NBA team. So on this channel, I share everything that I've learned about building an AI business because I believe that anyone can use AI to build their dream life just like I have. And the more people I help with videos like these, the bigger my brand grows and the more doors open for me and my team.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, it's really a win-win. So, let's get into it. All right. So before we dive into the data from my communities about what's working and what's not, we need to understand what we're actually measuring here. Because this isn't data from people who are raising millions and millions of dollars to build SAS companies or launching AI startups in Silicon Valley.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

This is from people who are exactly where you are right now. That's students or consultants or real estate agents, truck drivers, or even developers who are looking to go solo or break out of their current job. And what are all of these people doing? Well, they are starting an AI services business from scratch. An AI services business is a pretty simple idea where you help small to mediumsiz businesses to understand and then use AI.

### 🎯 応用例

That's it. And this gap in the market is the biggest opportunity since the internet. Not according to just me, but according to some of the world's smartest entrepreneurs like Kevin Olri and Ian Mark Cuba. I was fortunate enough to kind of stumble across this opportunity 3 years ago before anyone was really talking about it. And like many in late 2022 when Chachi PT dropped, I could tell that this AI thing was going to be the next big thing.

### 💭 考察

But I just couldn't figure out where the opportunity was for someone like me who had no AI experience, no investors, no millions in the bank, just essentially a laptop and a ton of curiosity around it. So I did what I always do. I looked back at history and I found that every time there's this huge technology shift like the internet or smartphones or social media or even like blockchain, the exact same pattern happens. The new technology drops. Companies know it matters but have no clue how to actually use it and get value out of it.

### 📌 まとめ

And then this wave of service businesses pops up in the middle in order to bridge that gap. So in the '90s it was web agencies helping these companies to get online and have a website. And in the 2010s it was app studios helping companies to build their own apps and get onto smartphones. And then after that we had social media marketing agencies helping companies to market on social media and get customers on these new and exciting platforms. And these businesses that were bridging the gap weren't billion-dollar startups.

### ✅ 結論

They were small teams, sometimes just solo operators who learned this new technology faster than the businesses could and then they got paid to implement it. So I realized that's the AI opportunity right now is just being that bridge helping businesses to understand and use this technology that they know they need but just don't understand yet. And that's when I started Morningside AI in early 2023. And since then tens of thousands of other people have been building their own versions of what we discovered at Morningside AI. And here is what we've all learned over the past 3 years.

### 📚 追加情報

is that there are two main paths that work for people trying to get into starting some kind of AI services business. The first path is around consulting and education where you learn tools like chatbt and claude and then you teach businesses how to use it through workshops or you audit their processes and find opportunities and recommend the kinds of AI tools and systems that can help them to get an advantage with the technology. And for people on this path, there is no coding required. Path two on the other hand is about build where you can learn to use no code tools to build AI automations and AI agents or you can go a bit more advanced and use AI to write code to create powerful custom applications for businesses. On this builder path, you're the person who's actually building the AI stuff for companies.

### 🔖 補足

But the great thing here is that you just pick the path based on your strengths. You don't need to do both. And we're going to be getting into how to pick the right path for you later in this video. But here's why this AI services model is working so damn well right now. It's because four businesses are absolutely drowning right now.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And they know that AI matters. They see the headlines. They see the competitors talking about it and the advantages they're getting, but they don't have time to learn it themselves. And they don't have $200,000 to hire McKenzie or Deote. So, there's this huge portion of the economy that are just stuck and don't have the AI help they need.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I think Kevin Olirri said it perfectly. Small to mediumsiz businesses create 62% of the jobs in America. They want to use AI. Help them solve for that and they'll pay you. So, that's the opportunity.

### ⚡ セクション 15

AI services for small businesses that don't have any help that they need. either doing AI consulting or AI education or building an implementation. So, in the final chapter of this video, I'll be breaking down the exact steps to start down either of these paths. But first, let's actually dive into the data that I've been talking about and prove this stuff is actually working for people like you and I. All right, so there was a ton of interesting insights that came from the data we mined this year from our communities, but I'm just going to save you time here and show you the three most interesting findings from this year's data for a beginner.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, first one centered around how fast the market for AI services is actually growing. Secondly, some key stats around what people are actually selling in 2025 and how much money they're making there. And thirdly, I'll be revealing the most effective way to get your first clients in days without creating content or spending money on ads. That's common across the entire community. So, first up, let's talk about the scale of what is happening right here.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, across my free community and my AAA accelerator program, we have tracked over $13 million US in reported revenue. Now, that's just what people choose to post publicly in the wins channel, but the real number is probably a lot more like 30 to 50 million when you account for everyone who doesn't share their wins in wins channel and also those who have maybe finished my program and are no longer in the community to post. But that's not all. The number of people who are getting clients and making money is going up 40 to 50% every quarter. So, we're not just seeing more people trying this.

### 📋 セクション 18

We are seeing more people actually succeed at this business. So, the whole space is accelerating right now. And honestly, that tells you everything you need to know about whether this market is saturated or not. Right now, it's clearly not. It's maturing.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And when markets mature, that is when the real money gets made. This is quite literally the perfect time to get into selling AI services. Next, let's dive into what people are actually selling. What kinds of AI services and automations and how much are they getting paid for those? So, back in 2024, the average deal size was around $4,120 with most people selling simple stuff like basic chat bots or simple AI voice systems and things like that.

### 📝 セクション 20

But if you look at the second half of 2025, the average deal size is now $13,870 dogs. And that is a 340% increase in about 18 months. This shows us that businesses are waking up and realizing that AI isn't just a fad and are willing to spend more and more money to get the help they need to adapt. That means that every day the amount of money up for grabs is growing. And get this, 49% of the deals right now are over $10,000.

### 💡 セクション 21

And back in 2024, that was only 8%. So, the market has completely shifted and even beginners are able to quickly increase their prices. And what changed? Well, let's look at what people are actually building and selling in late 2025. Firstly, simple AI chatbot sales are down 50%.

### 🔧 セクション 22

The market has clearly moved past that and nobody wants to pay big money for a basic chatbot like that anymore. Secondly, we have voice AI systems like AI receptionists that answer calls and book appointments, that kind of thing. Those are up 278%. And you have AI workflow automation through no code platforms like make.com and nat have held steady at around 24% of all sales proving to be a very reliable offer that businesses are seemingly always in need of. Then you've got some of the more complex things that are selling like rag systems and these are basically AI agents that can search through the company's documents and knowledge bases and give really accurate answers across all those documents.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Sales for these kind of systems are up over 300%. But the real surprise here is AI audits. And this is where you go into a business, you interview the team, you have a look at their workflows, and you deliver a report that says, "Here's where you should be using AI. Here's what tools you should use, and here's what we should build for you." This is basically the equivalent of a business paying for their first website back in the 2000s. That was like the first step of getting online.

### 💭 セクション 24

Now, the first step into using AI is an AI audit, which literally anyone can learn to sell in days, not months. This AI audit offer has grown 400% in the last year and it is now the fastest way to get your foot in the door to landing much bigger deals. We actually saw this at Morningside AI where at the end of 2024 we just kept running into this problem where companies wanted help with AI but they weren't ready to buy AI development or like they didn't know exactly what they wanted to pay for yet. So this basically meant that they didn't understand the technology and they didn't know what was possible for their company. So we started doing AI audits ourselves and we'd spend like 8 weeks going deep into a company.

### 📌 セクション 25

would be mapping out everything that they do, finding all the different opportunities that were available for them, and then we deliver this big massive report, and from there, we'd be ready to move on over $100,000 and more worth of development projects. So, this was a huge unlock for us. Now, that stuff may sound a little bit scary if you're just starting out, but people in my community are doing a simplified kind of one to two week audit version of this and selling these for literally $2 to $5,000 where they find opportunities and either implement them themselves or they say, "Here's what you need. Here's the audit. we can connect you with the right developers to be able to get that built.

### ✅ セクション 26

So essentially the explosion we've seen this year is taking the same thing that we do at Morningside but scaling it down to small businesses which is exactly where people like yourself can get started. And this kind of AI audit offer has become the go-to strategy for people who don't want to code necessarily but still want to be an AI and still want to make money and close deals. So the big picture here is this. The market has essentially matured and found the things that companies really want to pay for which is great news for anyone starting fresh in 2026. And I'm super jealous because when we started in 2023, it just was not as clear as this.

### 📚 セクション 27

And instead of having to feel your way around in the dark in 2023 like my team did, there are now very, very clear pathways to selling offers that businesses are actually paying for right now. Right now, let's talk about timelines, about how long it actually takes to get one of these businesses off the ground because I think this is where most people get it completely wrong and it really stops them from making the dive because they think it's going to be way more work to get started than it actually is. So when my team and I dove into the data from our communities this year, we tracked the exact timelines of thousands and thousands of people in the community who went from zero to their first client. And this is what we found. It turns out the median time to land their first client is just 9 days, not 9 months, 9 days.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And 91% of those first clients came from doing what's called warm outreach. Basically, this is just messaging people that they already knew. So their friends, their family, their old co-workers or bosses, which is a very very common one, or people on LinkedIn that they have connections with with just a simple message that is proven to open the door to conversations about selling some sort of AI service within days. And because I'm such a nice guy, I'm going to be giving away the exact resource used in my accelerator program to get these results for free in full course that's going to be coming with this video that's on my school community. I'll be explaining a lot more about that free course and everything that comes with it in the next chapter of this video.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, to summarize, the data screed for my communities this year kills three of the biggest myths around starting an AI business. Myth one, it's too hard to get started. As we've seen, all it takes is sending a few text messages and emails, and you can literally have your first client within 9 days. That is how hungry businesses are for help with AI right now. Myth number two, I'm too late, and the market is saturated.

### 🚀 セクション 30

As we've seen from 2024, the deal sizes are up 340%. Community wins are increasing 40 to 50% per quarter. If it was saturated, these would be going down. And finally, myth number three, you need to be technical to start one of these businesses. As we saw, the fastest growing offer is AI audits, which are up 400% yearonear, and they require zero code knowledge to do, and you can literally learn to do them in just a few days using the method that I'm going to be sharing later in this video.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, if you thought you weren't technical enough or you're too late, or this is going to take forever to get started, the data from this here says that you are wrong. Now, with all that data out of the way, we can get into the juicy stuff that you've been waiting for. We're going to be fully explaining the two different paths I've been talking about that people are using to start an AI business, regardless of their background. Then, in the final chapter of this video, I'm going to be giving you the step-by-step guide on how to do each of these pathways, plus a ton of extra resources for each step of the way. So, if you're not held back by the market, the timeline, or your technical skills, what is the next step from here?

### 🌟 セクション 32

It's choosing which of those paths is best for you because as the data clearly shows, there are two distinct and equally valid ways to succeed in the space. Two on-ramps depending on your background or interest. One is built on communication and sales. The other is built on build it. In my own journey with Morningside AI is a perfect example of this because as I said, we started way back in early 2023 and we were doing fully customcoded AI development for our clients.

### 🎬 セクション 33

But by the end of 2024, we kind of started hitting a wall and we realized that a huge chunk of the market of these businesses we were trying to help, they weren't ready to buy AI development at all because they didn't even understand what AI could do for them. So we decided to split our focus and we started offering both AI audits and education to help businesses understand AI and create their AI strategy. And then we had our AI development team as usual building out and implementing those solutions that we identified for them. So we essentially created two sides to our own business. the AI consulting and education and the AI development portion.

### 📋 セクション 34

And that is exactly what I want you to see here. You do not have to build both sides of the business from day one. Your power comes from starting by specializing in the one that fits you best. Your interests, your background, your connections, and what you really want to do with your AI career. So, path one is the consultant.

### ⭐ セクション 35

This path is perfect for you if you are a great communicator, a natural educator, or you love doing strategy. In this path, your value is in providing clarity and not providing code. You're essentially the one who goes into the business, can chat to them all, understand their problems, and design a blueprint for their AI transformation. You don't want to get into the weeds of debugging APIs and managing complex end to-end builds. You'd rather be on calls with people and kind of creating content or running workshops, building relationships.

### 📝 セクション 36

And the good news is that the data shows that this path is exploding. Remember that 400% growth in AI audits. That's predominantly people who are on this path. They're selling AI audits, strategy sessions, and team training workshops to help them understand and use AI. And when a project needs a custom AI development build, you can partner with a builder on the other path and take a cut when you hand it off to them.

### 💡 セクション 37

So, you can get a percentage of any deals that you hand over to someone who actually does the building for you. Great example from my AAA accelerator program recently was Rishi. And Rishi didn't start in AI or software at all. He came from an engineering and a consulting background. He was working a full-time job.

### 🔧 セクション 38

He had no audience and no product or no business. He started his AI journey by going to in-person trade shows and industry events across a bunch of different sectors. And then by using his communication skills, he was able to speak with business owners there and create a bit of interest and buzz around this AI help and consulting and solutions that he could provide. Those conversations turned into some follow-up calls and into paid discovery and scoping sessions. And only after that did he get in touch with some builders who he also found in the program and start to deliver some AI systems for them.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And in the last 6 weeks alone, Rishi has done over £10,000 in sales without ever writing a line of code himself. Now, path two is the builder. And I need you to listen carefully here because this isn't just for the hardcore developers who are watching this. This path is actually for anyone who's wanting to spend a bit of time to build a futurep proof and high-paying skill set for the AI era. And the entry point for most people here, like the thing you can actually start learning this week, is no code AI workflow automation.

### 💭 セクション 40

A skill that literally anyone can learn with just a few weeks of practice. This is using tools like make.com or n to connect different software together and make things happen automatically for businesses. It is the number one AI school right now that anyone can learn from scratch, even if you've never built anything before. Luckily for you guys, the free course that's going to come with this video on my school community already includes the step-by-step AI automation tutorials that will teach you everything you need to know as a beginner, which I'll be talking more about in a little bit. Now, as you learn AI workflow automation and you get a bit better, you can move up the value chain to building those high ticket voice AI or rag systems that we talked about earlier in the data.

### 📌 セクション 41

Great example of someone on this path is Miraza, who is a 22-year-old exarketing agency owner from my accelerator program who pivoted into the builder route by learning to build AI agents and automations and despite having no technical background or experience, has made over $65,000 just from community referrals by building voice AI systems for consultants in my accelerator program who bring him deals that they can't fulfill themselves. And if you're a developer already, you have a massive head start on this building path. All you need to do is watch those basics and just sort of skim through the free course material that is going to be on my school community for you to watch. And once you have those basics down, you're not far away from being able to build these 15 to $20,000 custom AI solutions for companies. So the builder path has a smooth on-ramp for beginners who want to start with the low code, no code soft.

### ✅ セクション 42

And then there's a fast track for experienced developers who can rip through all of that and jump into the much more advanced and high ticket development services. Now, the best part about this business model I'm teaching you here is that the two paths when you get to the end, they actually start to work together where the consultants find the opportunities and start to create strategy and then the builders can actually execute on that strategy for them. So, say for example, someone on the consultant path does a bit of warm outreach and gets in touch with an old co-orker or their old boss and sells them an AI audit for $5,000. Inside this AI audit, they identify a $20,000 voice AI project. They then reach out to one of their builder partners that they know, the people who are on the builder route, and they hand that project off to them for building.

### 📚 セクション 43

In this case, the consultant gets paid for the audit and then paid for the referral fee when they hand off to the builder, and the builder gets a perfectly scoped and high ticket project without ever having to generate the leads or have to do any of the sales work together there. It's literally a perfect synergy of allowing people to do what they do best. We've seen this two-sided dynamic play out hundreds of times in my community where we have people like MZA who I mentioned before getting $65,000 of voice agent deals from consultants who didn't know how to deliver themselves. Another great example is M and Ali who started out in my AAA accelerator program and quickly became development partners and they were able to make $320,000 over 6 months by partnering with consultants who had leads they just couldn't service themselves. Now these two have actually started doing AI audits themselves and have expanded to offer that full service themselves.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So the question you need to ask yourself at this point is do you want to be the one who helps businesses to kind of see the need for AI and then prescribe the solution that they need or be the one who actually does the building because in 2026 both of these two paths to making a killing you just need to pick your lane. Right to finish things off let's get into the how. You're probably thinking okay Liam I get it. I get it. But what's the best thing to sell first?

### 🎨 セクション 45

How much am I supposed to charge for this stuff? Where do I get my clients? What is the best path to 10K per month on each of these paths? Well, I'm glad you asked because we are now going to break down the first steps for both the consultant and the builder pathways. In this video, we're just going to be skimming along the big picture of each of these pathways.

### 🚀 セクション 46

But there is a full free course on my school community, which is going to walk you through the exact processes for each path and provides resources along the way so that you know what to do and make the journey that much faster for you. You can access it in the first link in the description down there. All you need to do is request to join. Wait a minute or two, then head to the classroom section once you get lined in, and then make your way step by step through the course material that's there. But before we break down those pathways, there is one last thing that we need to explain that both of these paths have in common.

### ⚡ セクション 47

That is really the secret that unlocks everything else. It's going to make your journey so much easier as a beginner. By this point, the data is undeniable. 73% of people now making six figures in my community started with a free project. And here's why that's so powerful.

### 🌟 セクション 48

You have a choice. You can try to sell a paid service from day one and spend 3 months getting rejected and maybe land one client. Or you can get your first free client in 9 days like we've said before and get a real world case study, a glowing testimonial, and then use that to springboard into your first paid deal in literally a fraction of the time. This is some super source for you guys right now. And if you choose to ignore my advice here and try to go for a paid project your first time, you are literally adding 3 months onto your journey when you could get started within 9 days.

### 🎬 セクション 49

This free project is not charity. It is the fastest marketing and on the job learning that you'll ever do. It's you buying your first customer for $0. It's how you and thousands of other people get the ball moving with this business faster than other people who are obsessed with making money immediately. So with this in mind of trying to get free work first and converting it to paid next, here is the step-by-step process to start each one of these paths.

### 📋 セクション 50

All right. So if you are a consultant, your path starts with one simple offer. It is called the AI tools audit. This kind of AI tools audit is much more accessible to beginners to start with on this consulting path because you're not having to go super deep into businesses and identify all these custom AI systems that you're recommending for them like we do at Morningside. Takes a bit more experience to understand the ins and outs of where AI can fit in and how you can build custom systems.

### ⭐ セクション 51

But if you're just starting with the lowest hanging fruit of hey here's chatbt which can be used like this. Here's cord. Here's perplexity. Here's tools like Higsfield for AI video and image generation. So the strategy here as a beginner consultant is to start with something easy.

### 📝 セクション 52

Start with something you're probably a bit more familiar with and recommend offtheshelf AI tools rather than custom development use cases. Now as for the actual method to execute on one of these AI tools audits, all of that is broken down for you in my free school community in the coursework. And that's going to include things like templates and just generally how to sell these things. The next step is how to actually get your first client. And as you know from the data, we're going to be using warm outreach.

### 💡 セクション 53

91% of people are getting their first clients in that 9-day window just by reaching out to people that they already know. That's friends and families and old co-workers and bosses, LinkedIn connections. And to make this a no-brainer for you and make it super easy to get started, I'm going to be giving away the exact warm outreach system that is using my paid AAA accelerator program for free inside the school community. It's a full guide with example messages and spreadsheets and showing the exact method that these people have used to get their results so fast. So after doing a bit of warm outreach, you might land two or three of these free orders.

### 🔧 セクション 54

You're going to deliver it using the method and templates that are on the school course for you. Then you can start to get your testimonials and you can start charging real money. So you might start small, maybe like $500, then increase that to a,000 and you can just build from there. The path from a first few hundred dollars to $10,000 per month involves a few key steps. And I've broken that entire value ladder and scaling process down in the school community course for you to follow.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Now, on the other hand, if you are a builder, your path is going to start with skill acquisition. You need to learn the basics of building with AI. No matter what your tech background, my free course on my school community has the beginner guides that you need on AI automation, AI agents, and even how to build apps with AI using what's known as vibe cutting. Step one for people on the builder's path is to watch those beginner guides and then apply what you learn in them to a few of your own personal projects and really try to flex your skills and see if you can sort of go outside of just what the tutorial taught you. And from there, you're ready to go and start helping other people to solve their problems with the skills that you've got.

### 💭 セクション 56

Your number one way of getting clients as a builder is within my free community. 11% of all leads reported in my community came from just talking to other people and being helpful. There's over 270,000 people. So just by talking to other people and being helpful, you can easily land your first free and eventually paid clients. What actually works for a lot of people is using the school community as like a personal LinkedIn.

### 📌 セクション 57

You can go onto the school community. You can set up your profile. You can be very active and help people with different development issues that they have and really just have a a safe space to work on your skills and build yourself up to the point where you can start charging more and more and more for the help that you give out. So the school community is really the perfect place as a builder to start building your reputation and getting free and paid clients. You get started by helping someone for free, maybe building a small automation for someone, fixing something for them.

You ask for a testimonial. They make a post saying how great you are in the community, and you can build your reputation there as a skilled and reliable AI engineer or AI automation developer. And that's ultimately going to lead to your first paid projects. So, the path to $10,000 per month from there involves going on things like Upwork or even better partnering with a great consultant or consultants from the community who can bring you a steady stream of qualified leads without having to do all the sales and marketing yourself. So, we have two clear parts and both start by providing value for free.

Both have a proven progression path to your first few thousand and both are broken down step by step with resources to help you every step of the way inside my free community with the course. So, that is it. That is the business model. That is the data of what's working. That is the paths that have appeared for us to go down and that is the blueprint for each for you to take action on.

Look, we're into 2026 and you have a choice to make. You can let this be another year where you just put off that dream that you've always had, you know, to build your own thing, to have real freedom, to work on your own terms, or you can finally get into the right boat. AI is going to be the single biggest wave of the next decade or more. And you can either learn to ride it like myself and tens of thousands of others who are doing it from all bloody backgrounds or you can just watch it pass you by or worse actually get washed away by it. And I hate to use that kind of fear and doom stuff in my videos but that is the case.
