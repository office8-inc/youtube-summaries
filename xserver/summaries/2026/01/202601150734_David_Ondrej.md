## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

It's actually very easy to focus when you have nothing going on in your life. When you have no interesting opportunities, no hot chicks blowing up your phone, no business deals coming on your door that are like super appealing and super promising, no invites to travel worldwide, people flying you out, you know, paying all the expenses. It's very easy to focus if you have nothing going on. But focus is one of these things you have to relearn. On each level of success, it becomes exponentially harder to focus because all the other opportunities are that much more appealing.

### 📋 背景・概要

But it's one of these lessons that you have to learn and relearn if you want to keep growing.
