### 🎬 導入

Here is how you can get 100 paying customers from Reddit with zero marketing budget. Most people think that Reddit marketing is spammy or that it doesn't work. But that's because you're doing it wrong. I found an AI tool that monitors Reddit 24/7, finds highv value conversations related to your product, and helps you write real authentic comments that actually convert. Here's the process.

### 📋 背景・概要

Go to okara.ai/reddit. Select the Reddit agent. Tell it the keywords you want to track. So, let's say you're building a Chad GBD alternative. Just type in chat GPT alternative.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

The agent then finds highly relevant Reddit threads where people are already searching for this and then it writes helpful comments that you can instantly post. So all you need to do is just copy the comment and post it. If you want to try this yourself, go to okara.ai/reddit.dit.dit.dit.dit.dit.dit.
