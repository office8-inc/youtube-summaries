### 🎬 導入

Here are five softwares that improve your productivity as a developer. Not sponsored whatsoever. First is a to-do list. Simple. Yeah, I know.

### 📋 背景・概要

I use a to-do list because it has some like nice natural language processing and it's a bit minimal. But really, anything [music] works. Even pen and paper would be great, but that's that's how software. This just helps you organize your priorities since you'll have a lot. A global keyboard shortcut to launch things fast, like raycast or the command pallet.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

It means you can launch an app that you want quickly without leaving the keyboard. And some have integrations for other types of softwares. It's honestly great. Obviously, AI, of course. But here's something different.

### 📝 詳細説明

Try out Open Router. Open Router lets you use one API key for every AI model out there and can intelligently route your query to the right model since all models have their pros and cons. Note-taking is a rabbit hole. I use Obsidian, but like you can use anything. The whole point of note-taking is for developers to document common workflows that might not make sense to commit to your source code, whatever.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Honestly, just get used to it. Keeping a history of things you copy and paste, which is a lot of things if you're a programmer, is key if you don't want to have to constantly search for things that [music] you just had a minute ago. Paste, Macy, or Raycast are great options for this. What softwares do you use? Let me know.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Fall for more.
