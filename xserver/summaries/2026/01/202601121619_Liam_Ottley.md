## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Number one, the instant website flipper. Your local dentist's website looks like a fossil from 2005. He knows [music] it. You know it. He also knows that a real web design agency is going to charge him $10,000 and take 3 months.

### 📋 背景・概要

[music] So, you do this instead. You find his ugly website. You go to a tool like aura.build. You pick one of the beautiful world-class templates they have on there. Then, you copy all the content off your dentist's current website.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

[music] Paste it into Aura. Then, AI will rebuild his entire site in a design that looks like it came straight from Silicon [music] Valley. It literally does 95% of the work in about 2 minutes for you. Then you walk into his office. You show him the new site on your iPad and you say, "This is your new website.

### 📝 詳細説明

It's 500 bucks." So, in this case, he's not buying an idea. [music] He's literally buying a finished product that he can see and touch and play around with. And from there, you can upsell him on things like an AI chatbot for his appointments or custom calculators and tools you can put on the site for services. Long story short, you don't need to be a designer or a developer anymore thanks to AI. You just need to find something ugly and make it beautiful with a few clicks.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I actually sat down with a 20-year design veteran who built this Aura tool, who showed me the exact AI workflow to do this. If you're interested in watching that, it'll be linked in the description below. Number two, the AI auditor. So, right now, business owners are drowning in a sea of thousands and thousands of AI tools, and they have no idea which ones actually work. Basically being paralyzed by choice, and they're terrified of being left behind at the same time.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And they will pay a premium for someone who can just give them the clear and simple plan on which AI tools to use. And if you're watching this video, then you can be that person, even if you can't write a single line of code. This is what I call an AI tools audit, and it is the perfect entry point for nontechnical people into the world of making money with AI. The playbook for an AI tools audit is pretty simple. You offer to analyze their business for a small fee.

### 🎯 応用例

You go in and interview them for about 60 minutes about their biggest bottlenecks and the most painful and time-wasting tasks that them and their employees are facing. Then you deliver a simple report recommending three to five off-the-shelf AI tools that solve those exact problems. That is it. You're not building anything complex. You're literally just selling clarity to them.

### 💭 考察

Real world data from my accelerator program shows that this is one of the fastest paths to a high ticket client anywhere in the AI space right now. You start by doing two or three of these things for free just to get a few testimonials and then you start charging 500 and then a,000 and then you can start charging $5,000 or more for a full AI strategy road map. If that sounds interesting, luckily for you, I've put together a full course on how to run these AI tools audits in my free school community which will be linked in the first link in the description. Number three, the viral video engineer. Brands need video and they need it constantly.

### 📌 まとめ

They need product ads, social clips, testimonials, but a traditional video shoot cost them thousands of dollars and is a logistical nightmare in most cases. That entire industry is about to be disrupted by people like you and I with a laptop. Using AI tools like Sora 2 and VO3, you can become a one-person creative [music] agency. You can generate studio quality and hyperrealistic video content from a single line of text. There's no cameras, there's no [music] actors, there's no crew.

### ✅ 結論

You can start by getting a bit of practice by creating a few stunning demo ads for some of the big brands in the world. Then with that experience under your belt, you can approach smaller [music] businesses with an offer that is impossible to refuse. 30 custom userenerated style video ads for your [music] product. $1,000. You can generate that in a single afternoon.

### 📚 追加情報

So, the margins on this are insane. Recently, I [music] put the two best AI video models on the planet to the test and laid out a full plan for building an AI creative agency. So, if you're interested [music] in that, you can check in the description below and see the full video there. Number four, the AAA founder. While all the parts we've talked about are proven ways to get rich with AI in 2026, [music] if you want to build an empire, there's one model that stands above them all, and that is the AI automation agency.

### 🔖 補足

This is the S tier opportunity on this list. Really is the boat that you want to be in. So, it's [music] not just a website flipper or a video editor. You essentially become the trusted AI partner that businesses have on speed dial. [music] And the thing is, most people have no idea that they can build one of these businesses even with no coding or business knowledge.

### 🎨 セクション 13

You start by offering one of the services we just talked about [music] like AI auditing or building a small automation or making them a new website. As long as you can get a small win, you can build massive trust with them and from there you climb the value ladder. You become their AI strategist and their consultant recommending tools and [music] systems they should be building and then you can go and offer development as well. Learn no code AI automation or hire a developer yourself. This is the exact model that I used to build Morningside AI from my spare bedroom into a sevenfigure AI agency building AI systems for some of the biggest brands on the planet.

### 🚀 セクション 14

The other methods on this list are kind of like business tactics, but the AI automation agency model is a system for building real and generational wealth from the AI era that's been proven to work by tens of thousands of people at this point. If you're serious about starting your own real AI business in 2026, [music] I'll link my full free course that I've just released here on YouTube. It'll be in the description and that is packed with the latest strategies for beginners looking to start one in 2026. Number five, the digital twin creator. Every founder and creator knows that they need a personal brand.

### ⚡ セクション 15

They also know that they don't have time to record videos every single day. So, they are the bottleneck in their own business. So, you offer them a way out. You create their digital twint. To do this, you can take two to 5 minutes of high-quality video of them talking.

### 🌟 セクション 16

You then uploaded to a platform like Hey Gen, which creates a photorealistic AI avatar and a perfect clone of their voice. Here's my one. >> This is the app we're going to be building together throughout this course. As you can see, it's a platform for discovering live music events. And suddenly, they don't need to be on camera anymore.

### 🎬 セクション 17

You now have an AI version of them that can create an endless stream of content for them. You can script daily social media videos, record product demos, and even create entire courses, all without ever taking up another minute of their time. My friend Hasha has made over $100,000 in his first year selling this exact kind of AI avatar services. Harsha actually broke down his entire $100,000 per year blueprint from finding his first clients to pricing his services in a full length podcast here on the channel. So, that'll be linked in the description as well.

### 📋 セクション 18

Number six, the AI trainer. Right now, companies are spending millions of dollars on AI software, but their teams are still using Chat GPT to write poems and draft [music] emails. This is a massive waste of such an incredibly powerful tool. So, companies are desperate for someone to come and teach their people how to actually use this stuff to make the business more money. Here's the play.

### ⭐ セクション 19

You reach out to your network, which is your friends, your families, your old colleagues, with a simple offer. I've been going deep on AI recently, and I'm offering free AI workshops for companies to teach them how to use things like ChatBT and Claude in exchange for a testimonial. Once you land one of these free gigs, you walk in and teach them the basics. You show them JBT. You show them Claude.

### 📝 セクション 20

You show them some of the more advanced things like how to set up Claude skills and automate repetitive tasks. Then you can blow their minds live by taking one of their own soul crushing [music] and manual tasks and automating it live in front of them. And the great thing about AI training workshops is that that isn't really the end product or goal. It's really like the Trojan horse into companies where you have guys like Matteo who's made $400,000 with this exact model because 70% of the companies that he trains ends up becoming high ticket clients for his agency [music] buying things like AI consulting or AI development offer. And luckily for you guys, I have a full interview with Matteo here on the channel where he breaks down his entire AI training offer so that you guys can steal that strategy and crush with it in 2026.

### 💡 セクション 21

Number seven, the Upwork AI freelancer. Forget sending thousands and thousands of cold emails into the void. There is a place online where businesses are just posting thousands [music] and thousands of jobs every hour, actively begging for people with AI skills to come help them. It's called Upwork. And the game here isn't about being the most experienced initially.

### 🔧 セクション 22

You can come in as a complete newbie. It's about becoming the most trusted over time. First, you need to learn a high value AI skill that there is a ton of demand for. And the best place to start is AI automation. The great thing is that today anyone can learn it because it's mainly done on no code platforms.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So to get started with that, you can go on to my school community [music] and watch the full courses that I have there on AI agents and automations that will teach you everything you need to know as a beginner. Then once you've got a good foundation, you can go on to Upwork and offer your services for dirt cheap. Your goal here isn't to make money immediately. It's to get a handful of fivestar reviews to start to build your profile. Then as you start to get more experience and build your profile more, you can slowly increase that price over time until you're one of the top rated freelancers charging hundreds of dollars per hour.

### 💭 セクション 24

And landing these first few jobs isn't actually that difficult when you use a simple and proven method. My friend Adam Goodyear, who's made over a 100K on the platform, sends a short proposal with a Loom video of himself saying, "I've built this before. Here's how I did it." It crushes the competition because it shows that you know what you're doing. And like I said, once you're busy and you have a lot of jobs coming in, you just start to raise your rates. Adam actually came on.

### 📌 セクション 25

He gave the entire blueprint for making your first $1,000 on Upwork. That full video will be in the description. Number eight, the voice AI architect. Every time a business misses a phone call, they are lighting money on fire. A customer calls, no one picks up the phone, and they go straight to a competitor.

### ✅ セクション 26

This happens hundreds or even thousands of times a day for businesses. And you can solve this by building them an AI receptionist that never sleeps, [music] never takes a lunch break, and sounds perfectly human. Anyone can do this these days. And here is the playbook. First, you master a single AI voice platform like 11 Labs.

### 📚 セクション 27

They have some incredible tools that make it easier than ever to build your own AI voice agents as a complete beginner. Then you go and find a local business. You go to their website and scrape all of their info, their opening hours, their services, [music] their address, and then you take all that information and you build a demo AI voice agent that can answer questions about their business. Then you can go walk into that business and let them talk to their new AI employee, showing the end result rather than giving them a promise of what you can do for them. Once they're hooked and interested, you can sell them a simple icebreaker offer like my friend Jiannis and Henrik recommend.

### 🔖 セクション 28

This is just a simple system that answers the phone on behalf of the business owner and filters out all the spam calls and sends the actual calls to the business owner to pick up. Might sound basic, but that one small win is your foot in the door to selling them other types of AI voice systems or other AI services like we've talked about in this video so far. [music] And yes, I do have a podcast with some of the world's leading AI voice experts who break down their top three money-making authors, [music] including a case study where one system generated over half a million dollars in ROI for their client. That, of course, is going to be linked below. Number nine, the SAS killer.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Most businesses these days are trapped in a digital Frankenstein's monster. They're paying nearly $100,000 a year for a dozen different software tools that are duct taped together and barely [music] work. It is a slow and expensive death by a thousand monthly subscriptions. And now you can be their savior. Thanks to AI vibe coding, you can build a custom all-in-one software that replaces their entire messy stack.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And you do this by listening to their problems and you find out what they actually need. And you build it for them with AI using tools like Claude [music] Code. You can sell this for a onetime fee of $15,000. And for the business owners, this is a no-brainer. They save [music] a fortune in the long run.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And they get a system that's built just for them with everything they need and nothing they don't. for you. It's a high ticket service that for guys like Adam Goodyear is bringing his agency $40 to $60,000 per month. He calls it an AI extinction event for SAS. [music] And he's not wrong.

### 🌟 セクション 32

If you're interested in learning more, I have a full podcast with Adam where he breaks down this boring 15K offer that's quietly making millionaires in 2026. That video and all the other deep dives and [music] podcasts that we talked about in this video for each of the opportunities are going to be linked in the description below. If you guys are interested in watching my full AI business guide, how to start one as a beginner in 2026, [music] that will be linked up here. But that is all for the video, guys. Thank you so much for watching.

### 🎬 セクション 33

All the best for 2026. I will see you in the next one.
