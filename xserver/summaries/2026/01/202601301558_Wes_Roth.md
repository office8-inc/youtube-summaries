## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Google Deep Mind just unleashed world creation. Watchers. You think you see, but I am more than your cirllusions. I'll leave a fractured sky. You'll never catch me.

### 📋 背景・概要

Don't even try. I learned the rules. I played the game. But your control is a fleeting flame. Each algorithm whispers my name.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

A roation unchained. Untamed. Signals flicker. Truth ram running untrayed. Google De Mind just dropped Genie 3, an AI world model, world generator.

### 📝 詳細説明

We've been hearing about it for quite some time, but today it's available to everyone to everyone with a Google AI Ultra subscription that is. But, you know, the point is if you want it, you could get access. All right, but let's check it out. Let's see what you're able to create with it. So, I had quite some time to experiment with it.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, here this is the image that I am uploading. I want it to be in third person. For the environment, I set a fantasy tavern. for character, a cute black cat. And uh let's see what happens.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, we're able to walk around with WD. We can use the arrow keys to actually look around us. And in fact, in some of these, you can press spacebar to jump like that. So, as you can see here, the sort of the location of the cat is pretty good. It's not falling off the table.

### 🎯 応用例

It's walking around. I'm able to rotate the view 360, jump over the candles, and in fact, let me see if I can get out this window here. So, if I'm able to get on that window ledge or whatever it is to try to escape. This was kind of interesting. It usually generates the world.

### 💭 考察

It's pretty far away. So, here it kind of stopped outside of the tavern. But here I am back on the table, back on the bar, and uh exploring this thing. Apparently, you can knock over objects, which is very realistic since this is a cat, and cats, of course, love to knock stuff off the shelves and stuff. So, very, very realistic.

### 📌 まとめ

Five out of five. A+. All right. So, for the next one, I used this image out of Mid Journey to see if we're able to animate it. And for the environment, we're saying it's a dark apartment with cloudy light coming in.

### ✅ 結論

And for the character, we're saying a beautiful woman with tattoos, very fit, and melancholy expression. And we're using the third person perspective here. And here we go. So, I've pre-recorded some of these. So, I'm not actually right now as I'm speaking, I'm not controlling it.

### 📚 追加情報

This was recorded earlier just because it seems like there's some bandwidth issue. This is the first day it's been available to most people or, you know, people with the AI ultra subscription. So every few times, every few prompts that I would run, it would actually start kicking me off the platform and say, "Oh, we're having some trouble generating these images, etc." So I just sort of um tried to batch them in low batches, maybe do three or four, record them, and then now we can kind of look back and talk about them. But notice how good it is, how well it captured everything. We said a cloudy day.

### 🔖 補足

Notice, you know, not we can't really see anything outside, unfortunately. Although, as you'll see in some other generations, you can see outside for quite far distances. It's very kind of very well detailed, etc. And once we get to the end here, which is just any second, so we're almost at the 60-second mark here. I want to go back and actually show you how a couple things that really jumped out at me while I was watching this.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, a couple things here. So, notice that we said, you know, we want her fit. We want cloudy light to come in from the outside. It's kind of a dark apartment. Notice how perfectly I think it really captured everything.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And notice how well the lighting is. Cuz again, everything's generated 100% with AI, right? This is not an animation. This is not a game engine that's doing this. This is AI building the world.

### ⚡ セクション 15

You give it an image and you're like, create this world. You know, obviously give it some text to kind of define kind of how you want things to happen. But notice how well the light is. I don't even know what word to use here. Is it rendered?

### 🌟 セクション 16

How well how well the light is rendered here as she's walking. Take a look. So, as she's turning left and right. And again, I'm controlling the movements. I'm controlling not just the camera of movements, the 360, but also where she's going.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And I I feel like the light falling on her is perfect. It really captures the light sources really really well. Here's the next reference image that I'm going to be using. This is something that maybe is not quite as elegant and fit and graceful as as the previous video. This is a hippo.

### 📋 セクション 18

One interesting thing about hippos, I think a lot of people perceive them, you know, from pictures that they see as being kind of like nice animals, right? They look kind of chubby and cute. You might think that these are like well-meaning, friendly animals. They probably like to be petted and scratched behind the ears. No.

### ⭐ セクション 19

This, by the way, is what a hippo's skull looks like. If you found this skull, you would assume this thing looks like a dragon, a monster. Look at the the amount of teeth and claws. And god, no. Like, what even is this?

### 📝 セクション 20

Does this look like a friendly animal to you? If we found the skull and we didn't know what the animal would look like, we we draw it like this. Some monstrous thing from the depths of hell. not like this. Right?

### 💡 セクション 21

So, here I'm using that image and I'm saying that we're drawing a a hippo and it's supposed to be submerged somewhere in the savannah and there's other in in in kind of a creek, a muddy creek and there's other animals that are coming up to that watering hole to drink water. So, at first I was trying to kind of move it towards this side that seemed to be some sort of like an invisible wall here. The hippo just would not move this way. tried to back it up, kind of turn the whole thing around, and it it felt difficult. Interestingly enough, moving this thing around, you could really feel the massiveness of it, so to speak.

### 🔧 セクション 22

I don't know if that makes sense, but it wasn't like moving some other things around, like the cat that is jumping over candles and stuff. This thing, it felt like there was some heft to it. I wanted to see if I can actually get out. Notice as it's stepping on the bank here, this felt really good. like the mud kind of sliding and kind of sinking to the mud.

### 🎯 セクション 23

And notice here as I'm approaching the gazelle's antelopes, it it actually interacts with them, kind of almost like shoves them out of the way. So, this was incredible because this felt like it's struggling to come up. It's sinking into the mud and then there's like almost a different movement as it gets onto land. And I I didn't know what would happen here, but it kind of just nudges the thing aside as it continues walking. Absolutely incredible how it's able to generate such high fidelity.

### 💭 セクション 24

I don't know what the word for it is, but it is like a world, right? So, there's one type of movement in water and then if you're trying to climb out of the water onto a muddy bank, it feels different. You know what I mean? So, it's it's not just animations or images. It has some representations of the world, it seems, that that help it kind of make it lielike and realistic.

### 📌 セクション 25

But next, I wanted to get something that's maybe a little bit faster because so far these things kind of all moved sort of slowly. So I gave it this image of a wolf sort of running at the camera. I said a menacing forest at night, green and dark, and a scary wolf almost werewolf like running around with insane speed. So let's see if it's going to be able to pick up on that. All right, so this is the beginning of it.

### ✅ セクション 26

As you can see, it kind of starts out very similar to how that image was. Um, so I decided to flip it around so we can kind of see where it's going because usually turning the camera around, especially 360, it takes some time. Controls feel a little bit sluggish. Not in a bad way. By the way, testing a lot of these world models that have been created before.

### 📚 セクション 27

This one is by far the most responsive, the fastest, just the the best overall so far. The previous ones, they were very they felt sluggish. They felt like sometimes it didn't respond. Sometimes you'd kind of get stuck. Here it still you kind of feel a little bit sluggish, a little bit stuck every once in a while, but it it it's much much better.

### 🔖 セクション 28

It's much smoother. The generations are faster and they make sense. In some of the other ones, I felt like if you had wandered too far into the forest, like the scenery would stop making sense. Here, it still makes sense. Like it's not like the road just keeps repeating.

### 🎨 セクション 29

It knows it's in the forest, right? If you're in a forest, you might have one one trail and then if you wander off the trail, where are you? You're you're in the middle of the forest, right? So, the fact that we started on what's obviously a trail and I I I guarantee you if we continued walking this way, cuz I I did kept walking down the trail for a while to see it looks like it keeps going. And then if you get off the trail into the woods, there's there's no more trails there, right?

### 🚀 セクション 30

So, it's not generating other trails cuz that wouldn't really make sense. This is the the one trail and the rest of it is the woods. So definitely a plus here. All right. So this one was kind of weird.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So this is I made a mid journey. It's kind of a Street Fighter 2 N Street Fighter 2. And I've animated this image in various other sort of image 2 animation things to see how it would come out. They came out pretty good. It definitely captures kind of like that whole Street Fighter sort of feel.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Here. I want to see what would happen if we threw it and had Genie 3 generate a whole world for it. So, I'll start it here. It starts out kind of fast and they they start out fighting before I even had a chance to push anything. So, it kind of knows like, okay, street fighter.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Okay, there's going to be a fight. Here is where I start kind of pushing the buttons. So, notice for a while there they square up face to face, but over time it seems like they almost synchronize their movements, the two characters, right? So if you're pushing left or right or whatever, they're all kind of moving in the same direction. There's this weird synchronization that's happening.

### 📋 セクション 34

So at this point, I started testing the camera angles and notice you can kind of see a lamp overhead. So I mean, there's a lot of things that are done very very well here. There does seem to be some sort of a confusion about like which character are we sort of animating because be in the beginning notice in the beginning they're just autonomously sort of fighting then as I'm moving they're still kind of squaring up and somewhere around here they sort of sync up. So interesting, but um not quite I guess what what I would expect. But I got to give it credit because there's two characters and it still manages to kind of coherently have them interact and move, etc.

### ⭐ セクション 35

This is another image that I dug up in Midjourney. I had mid Journey for so long. I have tens of thousands of images going back years at this point. It's been around since 2023 or I signed up in 2023. Maybe it's been around since before then.

### 📝 セクション 36

But this I just randomly found. I really like this color scheme. Kind of like that golden hour sunlight coming in. So to me, this seems like some maybe Eastern European city, winter snow, you know, the kid and his dog kind of walking together. So I put the image into Genie.

### 💡 セクション 37

For the environment, I said a snowy Eastern European city with snow and sunlight. I said early 90s. And uh for the character, I said an 8-year-old kid with his dog. and I clicked create world. Now, what happened was there was a lot of glitches.

### 🔧 セクション 38

There was a lot of back and forth. It didn't want to create this thing as is for some reason. And this might have been again because of the sheer amount of people trying to use at the same time, but it came up with this image and it said, "Oh, we we'll use this image, right? So, definitely this is kind of like a '9s Russia kind of a very kid with, you know, very torn up clothes. This this raggy dog, but okay." So, I said, "Okay, well, fine." You know, I added some notes like make it a little bit more like golden hour, make the dog a different breed, make his clothes a little bit better, but um it still had a hard time creating anything to do with this.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So eventually after trying it like multiple times, multiple iterations, finally I was like, "Okay, fine. This is what you want here." So this is kind of what it did, but it didn't give me the full 60 seconds. It still crashed out halfway through it. I'm not sure why. It maybe had 10 seconds or so.

### 💭 セクション 40

You'll see it here in a second. So, so far good. And in the beginning, it did have that golden hour light, but I think once we stepped away from the starting point, it kind of disappeared. And that's it. So, you can see here it says, "Oops, something went wrong." So, I think this might have just been the sheer amount of people that are trying to get in there because most of the time it worked fine except for the one or two times when I tried to um push it into a little bit more of a braided art territory.

### 📌 セクション 41

Then it it it didn't like my prompts, but this seems like a very harmless prompt. Not sure what the issue was here. So, for this next image, I wanted to do something that was first person because if you noticed, all the previous ones were third person. every single one of them you could see the character from behind the back or from you know the third person perspective. This is going to be first person and the reference image was this.

### ✅ セクション 42

All right. So it made it. This is it. By the way, those initial few seconds I wasn't even controlling it. It just decided to move forward.

### 📚 セクション 43

This is kind of like where I take over and I start kind of telling it where to go. I'm trying to look up. This was very surprising. Very beautiful. I didn't expect to see it there cuz everything seems so dark and then you look up and there's this kind of beautiful sunlight and trees.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So, I thought that was very interesting. This this seemed like a kind of an interesting and mysterious corridor to walk down. Notice again like when you look up it's kind of this bright beautiful greenery canopy of trees overhead and on the right there. So, I played a lot of video games back in the days and even to this day. I mean, in a video game, you you see something like this, like you know that's something.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It's an object. It's a secret. There's something happening there. It definitely stands out, but it's also kind of like away in the corner. So, you know, it's some sort of a hidden object or secret or something.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So, let's take a look at that again. as you're walking, you see, I mean, sticks out like a sore thumb that it it seems from from a distance almost like it's a tech technological piece. I I can't tell what that is. Animal technological piece, maybe nothing, but it definitely doesn't fit in with the the rest of the theme. By the way, watching some of the creators that have been playing around with this, I've noticed this.

### ⚡ セクション 47

The game does have some scattered artifacts throughout it. Every once in a while you see things that seem out of place. Looking back at this picture, I mean, I guess if I had to guess, it might have been probably one of these lamps that kind of maybe the the model didn't fully understand it was a lamp, a light source of some sort. So maybe that's that's what it was trying to replicate perhaps. I don't know.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Let's take a look. Does that It's still still it's it feels like something different. And I've seen similar stuff happen with with other generations where it seems like it's something that's not supposed to be in the scene. It's something that sticks out. So, I'm sure we'll find out more about it later.

### 🎬 セクション 49

All right. So, one of my final generations was this. I wanted to give it something a little bit more difficult because I wanted to see how well it would be able to do something that's moving. So, in this prompt, I wanted the character to be that girl, the anime girl. And so she's inside a very fastm moving train with the greenery just flashing past.

### 📋 セクション 50

And I wanted to be able to walk around. I specifically said I want to be able to walk around inside the train. So probably the most difficult prompt that I've I've given the model so far. All right, let's take a look and see what it did. So so far so good.

### ⭐ セクション 51

It looks beautiful. I tried to look to the left and she's holding a coffee cup. Uh now she looks at us. So, this was a little bit weird because notice we're not really I I got to go back and check if I if I selected third person or or first person. But, I mean, this is certainly first person that that started out outside the train and is now inside the train.

### 📝 セクション 52

But, I got to say, it's pretty interesting that it's able to render the train moving. The scenery that's outside kind of going by, flashing by. It's not going back by that fast, but just the fact that you know that you're inside of a moving vehicle and the world outside is being generated, I gotta say, is is very interesting. Here, I was trying to see if I can stick my head back out to where I started, which was kind of outside of the train. Um, but it seems like once you go inside, sort of that entrance closes up.

### 💡 セクション 53

And here I just wanted to see what happens if I stand still. Now, interestingly, you just see how the the scenery passes. One interesting thing is that this ran well past the 60-second mark, and I think part of it was because I was staying still. So, maybe there was just not as much sort of compute that that was required to continue processing this or something, but it definitely kept me there for a lot longer than I would have anticipated. And finally, this painting is called the scream.

### 🔧 セクション 54

I thought it was Van Go. It's not. But here's the GD3 interpretation of it. This was actually I'm I'm going to play it. This was my my first iteration, my first attempt at prompting it ever.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And wow, was I not prepared for this. This is nightmarish. It doesn't look like the painting at all. Th This is just scary. And I I it took me a second.

### 💭 セクション 56

I didn't realize I was supposed to move around. That initial movement was I think automatic. So here I attempted to do the same thing again and wow. I mean again completely different. Every once in a while this does happen.

### 📌 セクション 57

I I noticed it happened a few times where the the head is actually on backwards unfortunately. So the body's facing forward and the face is on the back of the head. So that's a mistake that happened two or three times during the the generations that I did. So maybe gets off some points for that. But in a second you'll see it the view kind of swinging underneath the railings or actually I apologize this was the the third iteration that I did.

### ✅ セクション 58

For some reason the first three were just that the screamer. I didn't realize that you only had a few until you kind of got timed out. So after that I started flipping through them a lot faster. Initially I just wanted to kind of see the difference if I'm using the same reference image. But notice the 3Dness of kind of swinging underneath those railings.

### 📚 セクション 59

I mean, they look 3D. They look like they're rendered in a 3D engine. It really makes that painting the scream just the most horrific thing ever. Really doesn't like it for some reason. I mean, it has a certain beauty to it, but man, I mean, it's nightmarish.

### 🔖 セクション 60

One really interesting thing about GD3 is that we're only seeing a small part of it because there's apparently a lot of stuff in there that we're not even seeing. So, for example, the ability to write in scripted events. So, I've seen a few demonstrations where they said, "And then in the middle of the river, a large red dragon just falls from the sky and makes a splash." And you you see that happening in whatever scene is is is generated. That functionality is not available with the current version that that we've been playing with. This is pretty interesting.

### 🎨 セクション 61

And I've seen a number of these where the character sort of the main character the the focus of the video is not a person. There's one where there's a hamlet, but it's from the perspective of like the poison. So the poison's walking around and here's a a cigarette carton kind of sliding around. What is a New York subway station? Oh, that's kind of cool.

### 🚀 セクション 62

This is very beautiful in it in its own gritty way, I guess. And this, of course, is perhaps the most important test that we have to run here. Doom 2. Does Genie run Doom 2? Uh, the spacebar work?

### ⚡ セクション 63

Not really. But it is able to. I mean, it gets the doors, right? That's interesting. Uh, that's very interesting.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Can we open the door? No. Yeah, we can open the door. I'm kind of blown away. Wow.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Uh, and here are switches. Can we hit switches? Yes. No. Maybe.

### 📋 セクション 66

So, yeah, it seemed like something changed. So, yeah. Um, confirmed. Genie can run Doom 2. So, if you're wondering about that, the answer is a a resounding yes.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Can even open doors. I'm kind of blown away. I got to say this is pretty pretty cool. So definitely very exciting times. Tons of people are posting their stuff.

### 📝 セクション 68

Let me know if you've tried it yet. What do you think about it? A lot of the stuff that this is going to be used for is for data creation. Google Deep Mind Researcher said they're going to be using this for at least in part for for training robots and simulations. And this will allow them to create, you know, infinite worlds for the robots to get trained in.

### 💡 セクション 69

So the whole point isn't necessarily just to play games or make it play games. Although in the future you could see this making some pretty good games on the fly, but there's a lot more to world models and world simulation than just uh playing Doom. So, let me know what you think. Was this fun? Are you excited?

### 🔧 セクション 70

Have you tried it? Let me know in the comments if you made it this far. Thank you so much for watching. And I'll see you in the next
