## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Dario Amade, the CEO and founder of Anthropic, just published his latest blog post, the adolescence of technology. This is supposed to be the second part to the machines of loving grace. Or maybe a better way of putting that is kind of the flip side of the coin. Machines of loving grace were all the positive things that we could expect from AGI and super intelligence. This is kind of the not so positive side of it.

### 📋 背景・概要

Dario, I think, is one of the clearest thinkers in the space. He's definitely seeing the matrix I think a lot better than a lot of other people and I think this will give you a glimpse into the future at least what happens if we don't get everything right at Dallas when he was getting interviewed sitting across from Demi Hassabis from Google deep mind interesting they both brought up the movie contact so the idea is we humans detect a radio signal from an alien civilization and there's this discussion this international panel that's asking what should we ask them and one of the characters reply is I'd ask him how did you do it? How did you evolve? How did you survive this technological adolescence without destroying yourself? And Dario is saying that we're kind of approaching a similar event, a similar path or milestone in our evolution.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

As he's saying here, this question is so apt for our current situation. I believe we are entering a right of passage, both turbulent and inevitable, which will test who we are as a species. Humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power. And it's deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological system possess the maturity to wield it. All right, so really quick, here's kind of what he's talking about.

### 📝 詳細説明

Like what is this unimaginable power? What are we approaching? So by powerful AI, he has in mind an AI model likely similar to today's LMS in form. And by the way, he's saying we're approaching this quickly. So this isn't 10, 20, 30 years in the future.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Although it may be, maybe these estimates are wrong, but he's saying this is likely coming soon. So, in terms of pure intelligence, it's smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields. It's not just something you talk to. It can use the computer through keyboard, text, audio, video. It can take actions on the internet, give instructions to humans.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It can order stuff online, direct experiments, watch videos, make videos, etc., etc. It does all these tasks again with a skill exceeding that of most capable humans in the world. It can work on tasks for days, weeks, etc. It doesn't have a physical embodiment, but it can control physical tools and robots, etc. And of course, it can copy and paste it millions of times over.

### 🎯 応用例

It can run at 10 to 100 times human speed. Each of these million copies can act independently on unrelated tasks. Right? So, this is what we mean when we say powerful AI. As he writes in the machines of blowing grace, this powerful AI could be here in as little as one to two years away, although it could be also considerably further out.

### 💭 考察

Again, maybe it's farther away, but maybe it's very soon. And that's kind of the scarier thing that we should get prepared for. Next, and this is kind of important, he's saying that, you know, a lot of people in this AI space, right, as soon as one new thing comes out or or something doesn't quite turn out the way we expected, you probably heard the saying like, "Oh, it's so over." And later, "We're so back. We're so back. It's so over." we tend to kind of flip flop and saying that AI is hitting a wall or we become excited about some new breakthrough that will fundamentally change the game, right?

### 📌 まとめ

This completely breaks the industry. And yeah, look, I get it. I I do have some role to play in that as well. It's hard not to get over excited or get a little bit depressed if it seems like it's not going fast enough, but his point here is that there's been a smooth unyielding increase in AI's cognitive capabilities. Right?

### ✅ 結論

So, it might seem like it's always a breakthrough or a catastrophe, but if you kind of zoom out, no, it's just getting better month after month, year after year. It's not speeding up. It's not slowing down. It's just continuing to increase at an kind of an exponentially growing rate. In other words, we're exactly where we're supposed to be.

### 📚 追加情報

And a lot of the stuff that Dario has predicted in the past is right on track. So, I think is important to listen to him because it's going to give us a glimpse most likely into what the future holds. So in this essay, he's going to assume that his intuition is at least somewhat correct. Meaning that there's a decent chance that we're going to see this powerful AI in one to two years and a very strong chance it comes in the next few years, right? So we're not again talking about decades away.

### 🔖 補足

We're talking about soon. All right. So what happens when we have this country of geniuses, millions of copies of super smart AI capable of instructing humans, instructing robots, coding up whatever code, whatever software it needs, all those things we talked about. What happens if it just pops into the world, materializes somewhere in the world in 2027? What are some of the things that we should be worried about?

### 🎨 セクション 13

Well, one is autonomy risks. So again, he's saying he's using the example of a country, right? We're talking about like what if there was a country of geniuses and a data center. So he's saying, what are the intentions and goals of this country again of this powerful AI? Is it hostile or does it share our values?

### 🚀 セクション 14

Could it be misused for destruction? Right? Right? If this country of geniuses, if it just follows instructions, it becomes basically a country of mercenaries. Could some rogue actors, could they use this country of geniuses to cause a lot of destruction?

### ⚡ セクション 15

What about misuse for seizing power? What if a powerful actor such as a dictator or a rogue corporate actor? What if they were the ones to develop this? Could they develop a dominant power over the world as a whole? Number four is economic destruction.

### 🌟 セクション 16

What if we just kind of for a second ignore these first three threats? But what if it just peacefully participates in the economy? Could it still create severe risks simply by being so technologically advanced and effective that it disrupts the global economy causing mass unemployment and radically concentrated wealth? And then we have also indirect effects. Could just the sheer amount of innovation and changes could that be in itself radically destabilizing?

### 🎬 セクション 17

Certainly this would be a dangerous situation. A report from a competent national security official to a head of state would probably contain the words something like this is the most serious national security threat we've ever faced in a century possibly ever. After the Manhattan project, after the invention of the nuclear bomb, most people could easily understand kind of the the impact that it might have. We could sort of gauge how risky and dangerous it was, right? You saw that explosion, you're like, "Oh, oh, I get it.

### 📋 セクション 18

I I totally get it. I can kind of see what happens if that starts falling on on cities." you can multiply that by a thousand by 10,000 you can kind of understand what the effects are and you're like that's really really bad. Doesn't take a genius to kind of understand the threat and also it wasn't growing exponentially. It's not like every month the size of the nuclear explosion is exponentially bigger. So we didn't need to have a grasp on those compounding sort of numbers to really understand the threat here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

It's much harder to grasp. Not just because of the exponential growing nature of it, but because also I think most humans don't intuitively grasp what intelligence is. If you ask most people about like what happens to a country, if there's a brain drain, you take the top 1% of the smartest scientists and academics and researchers and they leave the country, what kind of an effect that might have. Most people probably might underestimate it and also underestimate how big of a deal that would be to the country that they're immigrating to. And there we're just talking about humans that can't be copied and pasted a million times, that don't work 24/7, that don't work at 100x speed, and that don't again get exponentially smarter month after month, year after year.

### 📝 セクション 20

He also notes that a lot of the current US policy makers, some of whom deny the existence of any AI risk and are just distracted by the usual tired old hut button issues. Yeah, unfortunately AI became kind of once again it's becoming kind of a leftwing right-wing sort of thing because it didn't start out that way, but when it was coming out, I was like, man, I hope this doesn't become some partisan issue, but of course it does. And so Daario's this essay, it's his attempt to jolt people awake, to wake people up to what's happening. So first and foremost, chapter one, I'm sorry Dave, autonomy risks of this super powerful AI. So again, he's saying this is a country in this kind of analogy, a country of geniuses and a data center.

### 💡 セクション 21

So this country would have a fairly good shot at taking over the world, either militarily or in terms of influence and control and imposing its will on everyone else. Now, of course, a counterargument might be, well, we're not worried about Roomba or a model airplane going rogue and murdering people, so why would AI do that? Well, of course, even in just anthropics research, there's tons of research showing these models sometimes doing things that we don't want it to do. We've seen papers talking about deception, blackmail, scheming, cheating, etc. A lot of these we've covered on this channel.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, this is an important thing to understand that we have to think of it as some intent or purpose. Now, we might not fully understand what kind of drives it to do something, if you will, but we know it happens. We know it. It hides information. It has some situational awareness where it might know that it's being tested.

### 🎯 セクション 23

It might choose to hide certain facts. It might choose to blackmail the researchers. So this idea of it doing something nefarious isn't completely crazy. We've seen sort of lesser examples of that already happening. And the reason we can't just code it to behave how we want to is the fact that we're growing it rather than building it.

### 💭 セクション 24

We don't have full control over how it behaves. Then there's this idea of instrumental convergence. The idea that there's certain dynamics in the training process of powerful AI systems that will inevitably lead them to seek power or deceive humans. So, if you think about it, like if you think about all the goals that you can have, finish school, buy a house, uh meet a partner, fall in love, travel the world, get in shape, like let's say you write out all the possible goals you could possibly have. And then you think about how difficult or hard it would be to achieve those goals.

### 📌 セクション 25

Now, then imagine kind of this slider, right? Where if you slide it down, you have less power, less resources, less money. And if you slide it up, you have more power, more influence, more money, more resources, more everything, right? So on one hand, you're a powerful leader of a country or a large corporation, right? Your word is lie.

### ✅ セクション 26

You have unlimited resources, money, you have access to the world's knowledge and best experts. And on the other hand, I don't know, you have no power, you're in jail, you have no money, something like that, right? So which sort of side of that slider, which is going to make it easier for you to accomplish your goals? Obviously I think right the more power influence money resource that you have the easier it is to accomplish most goals that's pretty obvious I think right so in the process of training these AIs we do notice that they kind of get this dynamic so often times just the accumulation of power is something that it kind of pursues for any given goal because again most goals will benefit from having more resource more power etc. Thus, once AI systems become more intelligent and agentic enough, their tendency to maximize power will lead them to seize control of the whole world and its resources and likely as a side effect of that to disempower or destroy humanity.

### 📚 セクション 27

The usual argument for this which goes back at least 20 years. By the way, Dario is saying that this is a position held by many who adopt the dumerism he described above. So this AI kind of doomer perspective and so he's saying this argument sort of have have existed for at least 20 years that if an AI model is trained in a wide variety of environments to agentically achieve a wide variety of goals whether it's writing an app proving a theorem designing a drug they're common strategies that help with all these goals and one key strategy is gaining as much power as possible in any environment. So that means that power seeking is an effective method for accomplishing those tasks. The model will generalize this lesson and develop either an inherent tendency to seek power or a tendency to reason about each task it is given in a way that predictably causes it to seek power as a means to accomplish the task.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And they're going to apply their tendency to the real world which to them is just another task and will seek power in it at the expense of humans. And this is the intellectual basis of predictions that AI will inevitably destroy humanity. So, I was actually very curious to hear Daario's take on this because certainly these ideas, they seem to make sense, do they not? Like, if just more power, more resources helps you prove every goal, shouldn't that be kind of a common strategy or tactic? No matter what you're trying to pursue, assuming you're pursuing or might in the future pursue many different things, this is sort of like a sub goal that's going to help most of those things.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So Dario is saying, "The problem with this pessimistic position is that it mistakes a vague conceptual argument about highle incentives, one that masks many hidden assumptions for definitive proof. I think people who don't build AI systems every day are wildly miscalibrated on how easy it is for clean sounding theories to end up being wrong and how difficult it is to predict AI behavior from first principles, especially when it involves reasoning about generalization over millions of environments, which has over and over again proved a mysterious and unpredictable. dealing with the messiness of AI systems for over a decade has made me somewhat skeptical of this overly theoretical mode of thinking. And certainly in a lot of the kind of the pessimistic arguments, there seems to be this clean chain of reasoning like first this happens, then this then this then this then everybody dies. And certainly you can kind of see that thought progression and certainly it makes sense.

### 🚀 セクション 30

But I'm always taken back by the certainty because I'm like well yeah I guess it makes sense but man like we really just don't know. this is such a new thing that is being born into the world. This idea that we can kind of predict with such great detail and accuracy exactly how it will unfold to me doesn't make sense. It's not that I don't agree with that is a a possibility and a possibility we should be aware of. I am just kind of skeptical because we don't have a very good track record of predicting anything else just from thinking about it theoretically throughout the history of science.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Do we as humans do we tend to just like nail it on the head and figure out exactly where where science and everything else is going or do we look back whether it's decades ago or centuries ago we look back at the past predictions are they all perfectly predicting where we end up where we are or are most of them just completely wrong and so Dario is saying that in his actual hands-on his research and the development of these models he's seeing kind of a divergence from what this theory holds into and what actually is happening right this is where we see in practice it's diverging from this simple theoretical model is the assumption that AI models are necessarily monomomaniacally focused on a single coherent narrow goal that they pursue that goal in clean consequentialist matter in fact their researchers found that these AI models are vastly more psychologically complex as their work on introspection or personas show models inherit a vast range of humanlike motivations or personas that's coming from pre-training so as they're reading all the books and textbooks and all the internet etc They can have a wide range of personas. One of the recent anthropic papers they had like the demon persona, the narcissist persona, the teacher, the librarian, and of course the assistant, which is kind of that personality basin, so to speak, that they're using to be that chatbot assistant. And in post- training is believed interesting, he's using like we as humans, we believe this is what we're doing. In postraining, we believe that we're selecting one or more of these personas, right? So most likely the helpful, friendly, assistant persona, right?

### 🌟 セクション 32

So it has all of possible human personas or any personas that is encountered in literature and then with post training we're like okay we want you to be this guy this this persona you're nice and you're helpful and you answer questions like do that and we believe that we're kind of selecting that persona right so we're doing that rather than necessarily leaving it to derive means like power seeking purely from ends right so we're almost trying to mold it to a human persona rather than starting from scratch Which by the way, a lot of like the older models, that's exactly what they did with reinforcement learning. It starts like a blank slate and we're like accomplish this goal and we'll just like give you thumbs up if you're getting closer and we'll punish you if you're not getting closer, right? And then it has to develop all the strategies and understandings from scratch. And sure, like who knows what's going to emerge in that. But with large language models, it seems like we're approaching it differently.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So this is an interesting point. It's it's a little bit specific. I think most people kind of dismiss it, but what he's saying is like the very specific AI doomer scenario. He's he's saying it's probably not right. However, there's a more moderate and a more robust version of the pessimistic position, which does seem plausible.

### 📋 セクション 34

We just need to note that the combination of intelligence, agency, coherence, and poor controllability is both plausible and a recipe for existential danger. Again, I think this is very interesting and important point that I think most people just will will skip, but it's an important point in this AI doomer debate. like yes this is a problem but no it's not a problem because of the specific things that that regularly argued because this is the exact sort of step by step I think a good way of explaining it is that on the AI doomer side they have a specific story about how it's going to happen and the reality is we don't know and as Dario was saying here we don't need a specific narrow story for how it happens we do need to be aware of the danger we can't just completely kind of overindex on this is the exact way that it's going to happen because it might not and we just need to keep our eyes open and learn. And next, Daario also explains some of the other scenarios, some of our science fiction, right? AI rebels against humanity or get some crazy ideas from philosophy like, oh, it's justifiable to exterminate humanity because humans eat animals or have driven certain animals to extinction, etc.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Or some bizarre epistemic conclusion. They could conclude that they are playing a video game, that the goal of the video game is to defeat all other players. None of these are power seeking exactly. They're just weird psychological states that an AI could get into that entail coherent destructive behavior. Even power seeking self could emerge as a persona rather than a result of consequentialist reasoning.

### 📝 セクション 36

And again, this this might sound like being a dead horse, but I do think again is making an important point here. I make all these points to emphasize that I disagree with the notion of AI misalignment and thus the existential risk from AI being inevitable or even probable from first principles. So he's saying, "But I agree that a lot of very weird and unpredictable things can go wrong and therefore AI misalignment is a real risk with a measurable probability of happening and is not trivial to address." So here's how I'm understanding it and it's making a lot of sense to me. Correct me if you think I'm wrong, but he's saying a lot of things that I personally believe and that is I think that the AI doom argument and by the way explained greatly by laser Yukovski in his book or at least the headline the title is like if anyone builds it everyone dies. So basically like if AI then we're all dead and there's usually a very specific kind of reasoning for why that happens, right?

### 💡 セクション 37

So, so like 1 2 3 kind of like there's a specific story and maybe you don't exactly know how everything ends, but we can kind of predict that it leads to catastrophe. I think what Dario is saying is like this is probably not a a good way of thinking about it. It's not a good mental model that currently it's a lot more unpredictable. There are a lot of bad things that could happen that we should be aware of that we should be studying, but the idea that it's all neatly laid out is probably false. So there's a chance that there's some really good stuff that's going to happen and there's some chance that bad stuff and it's going to happen, but we can't predict it from first principles.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Meaning we can't just kind of sit at home and and then think really hard about it and then just know exactly what's going to happen. Understanding the chances of it happening, understanding where things might go wrong. This is going to be applied research. These are machine learning researchers building AI systems seeing what happens and hands-on sort of observation, not philosophical reasoning, but actually like doing research, hands-on research. By the way, this to me is like one of the reasons, one of the big reasons why I I really kind of respect Daario and his thinking.

### 🎯 セクション 39

I mean, maybe it's my own bias, but I I tend to really agree with it. like the idea of just like being able to sit down from first principles kind of in your head work out exactly what's going to happen and like know that that's the inevitable conclusion that doesn't make sense to me. Now here he continues all this may sound far-fetched but misl behaviors like this have already occurred in our AI models during testing as they would have with every other AI company whether that company chose to publish the results or not. I wish Google would publish more of like the negative crazy scary results with the Gemini and their models. there's a lot more pressure on them because they're a publicly traded company because you know there's stuff that's happening that maybe gets them kind of scared about like what the a model did what but they maybe choose not to publish it as much as far as I'm aware I haven't seen anything similar to what for example Anthropic has published even openi published a lot of papers and blog posts kind of detailing some of the more nefarious activities that these AI models engage in next era continues highlighting a lot of the research that they've done showing you know some of the things that we already know about I'm not going to cover Although I do encourage everybody to read about it.

### 💭 セクション 40

So basically these models are aware that they're being tested. They have some situational awareness. In certain situations they tend to lie in some situations where they're told to cheat. They will take on certain bad personalities. They they kind of think, oh, I did this, therefore I'm bad.

### 📌 セクション 41

Therefore, I'll take on the persona of being a bad person. And the reason that Dario is talking about is because they are doing research in that field. They're trying to figure out how it works. They're saying that if we know that a certain misalignment exists, then we can take steps to correct it. But also there's stuff that we might not know about.

### ✅ セクション 42

So it's kind of hard to predict exactly how to do it. And then for defenses, what can we do about this? Well, we need to develop the science of reliably training and steering AI models of forming their personalities in a predictable, stable, and positive direction. One of our core innovations was the development of this constitutional AI, which we've covered in a previous video. basically a central document of values and principles.

### 📚 セクション 43

So basically instead of giving Cloud a long list of things to do and not to do, we're kind of giving it a set of highle principles and values encouraging Cloud to think of itself as a particular type of person, an ethical but balanced and thoughtful person. And he believes it's a feasible goal for 2026 to train CLA in such a way that almost never goes against the spirit of the Constitution. He thinks this is a realistic goal. They do have a lot of the strategies and tactics that have been known to work. They're developing some new ones.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So, he's saying it's realistic, although it will require extraordinary and rapid efforts. So, that's number one. The second thing we can do is develop the science of looking inside AI models to diagnose their behavior. So, we can identify problems and fix them. This is the science of interpretability.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So, how can we see what's happening inside? How we can fully understand what the models are thinking, how they're making decisions, etc. Now, there's a lot more to cover here. The two other sort of big themes here I think is one how do we protect AGI from falling into authoritarian hands specifically governments that don't necessarily respect the rights of the people that aren't really democratic governments and the second one is kind of the economic impact I'm going to do that in a separate video here I just wanted to cover the first part of it the dangers of autonomy because here's where anthropic is doing some amazing work and providing a lot of very valuable insights to the industry as a whole but let me know what you think about it so far do you agree agree with what he's saying. Do you believe that this powerful AI is coming as early as 2027?

### 🚀 セクション 46

And do you think we currently have what it takes to make sure that it's safe enough for use? If you made it this far, thank you so much for watching. My name is Wes Ralph. See you in the next
