## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I have zero fear of any like AI focused dangers. LLM's taking over and like hacking our systems and like killing humans. This is science fiction. The real danger is like the people who run the world using this to brainwash people, right? The average person even today believes blindly what said on the news, on the TV, on the newspapers and mainstream media.

### 📋 背景・概要

Now imagine that amplified with AI, right? When people lose their ability to think and just outsource all of their thinking to JGBT, then all you need to do is control the training data, the answers that JGBT gives and you control the population. This is the real danger. Not some like, you know, oh, Terminator AI is going to rise up. It's not happening.
