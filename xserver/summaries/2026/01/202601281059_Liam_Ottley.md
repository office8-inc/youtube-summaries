## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

The future of AI assistance is here and it's not from Anthropic. It's not from OpenAI. It's not even from Google. It's from a little open source app called Claudebot which has taken the internet by storm. It is by far one of the most powerful AI tools I have ever seen.

### 📋 背景・概要

And so in this video, we're going to be breaking down what it is, how it works, the dangers and risks that you need to be aware of before diving in, and most importantly, the top three ways to start printing money with this before everyone else catches on. Plus, I'm going to be giving away my free guide on how to get Claudebot set up for yourself the right way in just a few minutes. So, stick around for that. All right, Mark. We're now in the Javas era of AI and uh we're going to break it down here for you guys.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Not only what Claudebot is, how significant this is, and how it's really an entirely new market opening up for making money and building businesses, which we'll get into, but more importantly, like how to set this thing up, how it actually works, um so you guys can figure it out and start moving on it now because it is really taken off. So, Mark, thanks for coming on, mate. What are we going to be going through here? All right. So, I'm going to walk through how Claudebot works and what it is.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, you have Claude Code, which the world, including myself, have gone pretty insane over. Claudebot is like a brain that's not necessarily on a terminal. So, you don't have to interface with Claudebot on that boring terminal. And you don't have to use something like co-work either. So, you can use whatever input you want.

### 💡 実例・デモ

It could be a Telegram message, a WhatsApp message, Slack, Discord. You have so many options on how you interface with it. And even though it's called Claudebot, you can actually use whatever language model you want. So it's meant to be air traffic control where you get the message and depending on what tools and skills it has, it can talk to you like a chatbot. It can work like an agent.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And most importantly, you can tell it to be proactive. So if you're Liam, tell me about the top 10 trends happening in AI right now. What would be the most important for my audience? Then instead of just answering your questions or doing the thing like claude code would do, it can do the thing, it can be proactive and do something else later or come up with something on its own later. So this is kind of freeing what you guys may be familiar with the the functionality of of clawed code.

### 🎯 応用例

We're basically like jailbreaking it, freeing it from uh being stuck on your desktop or playing uh accessing it through a command line. We can now set up a a telegram bot that we can message directly. So, whenever you're on the go, um, in Mark's case, he's bought a Mac Mini to set this up on, but as we're going to go into, there's other options as well, but it's basically setting up your own special version of Claude code that has access to a bunch of files and more importantly combining these skills in there as well that allows you to access it from wherever you want. Um, and this is a massive leap in the right direction towards uh, like the Javas AI that we're all kind of dreaming of. >> And really, the reason why this is a big deal if your audience is still saying, "Okay, great.

### 💭 考察

Why do I care?" Why do I care? because this has gone viral because it's the first time you actually have a personal assistant that you can truly configure and you don't need edit, you don't need m.com, you don't need a 100 node workflow. You can literally just as soon as you install it and you can go back and forth with any AI to help you, you can build pretty much whatever you want. So this is the beginning of the personal assistant era. This is the whole like the future is already here.

### 📌 まとめ

It's just not evenly distributed, guys. This is the future right here. And if you can make the most of it now, there's this arbitrage opportunity where you're going to literally be super human for about six months, maybe even 12 months before the rest of the people catch on to this. >> Yeah. So, if people look at this part where you just send a message, goes to Cloudbot, comes back with an action, you might be like, okay, well, this voice flow thing from two years ago does the same thing.

### ✅ 結論

But there's a big difference between this and voice flow because the TLDDR is, like I said, it is the air traffic control. So, any channel you want. You don't have to do anything fancy. Everything comes out of the box and this is fully open source. Meaning if you want to change what it can or can't do or add a different connector, you don't have to wait for a platform to do it for you.

### 📚 追加情報

You can do it yourself. And in terms of the tools, it comes with a series of skills like it already knows how to write Apple notes if you give it its own desktop. It can create all kinds of 11 Labs voices and clones. And a lot of these things that I'm mentioning in passing were huge edit workflows just four or five months ago. And now it's all natural language based.

### 🔖 補足

And the fact that you can even make Claude modular like essentially let's say Claude is out of reach financially either for you or your clients. You can run a local model and then have that hooked up to this Claudebot brain and Claude's just the orchestrator. The Cloudbot just decides what happens when, which tools are used, and which skills are needed. Yeah, I mean the the quickest thing you could do to cut your cost is jump over to some of the the Google models, you know, like go from using Opus 4.5 to anything in the Google suite. Uh far far cheaper than uh than the anthropic ones.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So there's that. Or I mean if you're really trying to minimize cost, it would be the Google side, right? Rather than having to purchase the Mac Mini and run the run the stuff locally. I tried to uh I tried to run I can't remember what it is O Lama um and get it to do a run claw code for me and I've got a pretty decent Mac and it was just like it took 40 minutes to generate like 3,500 tokens or something. So yeah, there is definitely a hardware limitation so people need to be aware of that.

### 🚀 セクション 14

>> Yeah, it's a good segue. So the ways you can use and set up Cloudbot, like we said, you don't need a Mac Mini. The TLDDR of why people like myself have gone one is if you want to have that interface where you can physically see that your agent or agents have their own workspace, their own desktop where it can build, manage files, operate its own environment fully, but you want to separate it from your Mac in your life so you don't risk hackers, viruses, all kinds of things going wrong. That's where the Mac Mini is becoming helpful. And also if you want to use open source models like Liam said my computer basically nukes itself if it tries to run something on Olama.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So because it's a virgin blank slate technically computer of its own. You can also run language models a lot more easily. But for most of your audience the cloud is probably one of the best places to go. You can literally use Amazon Web Services. There's tons of tutorials already on this and you can hook it up on the free tier and you can use this on the free tier.

### 🌟 セクション 16

It just might not be as pretty and cute as me what I'm about to show your audience shortly in terms of how I has have it set up. >> Love it. So, what you've got what maybe 10 20 bucks a month or we talking like 50 100 bucks a month to actually run this at any kind of uh kind of scale. >> This literally free tier like you can live on the free tier depending on how much you use it. I suppose it's if you're choosing to use the like the Gemini API like accessing it through a hosted model like self not a self-hosted model but a provider where they're already running the models for you and then you're just paying for the uh cloud space to be able to run the claudebot itself right rather than running the clawbot and also uh hosting the model.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So you want to stay away from hosting the model uh on the cloud setup as well. Guys, if you are already sold on Clawbot and want to get this set up for yourself the right way in a few minutes, I've got my full guide on how to do that in the first link in the description. It's going to break it down for you so that you can set it up the right way without all the risks. Plus, with that resource, I'm also going to be including a more in-depth breakdown of each of the money-making methods for you guys so that you can take action on them today. Yeah.

### 📋 セクション 18

And there's one more thing. Um, let's say you don't want the Mac Mini, but you still want to run it locally. You could also use something like Docker to create a container to run a local model to also interface with this. So, it's very malleable because it's open source and unlike a company telling you how you have to use something, it's completely up to you. It's just a matter of what fits the best for you.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Now, in terms of where mine lives. So, obviously I have the Mac Mini here. Where it lives is its own laptop. So, this laptop, I'm basically rendering this on my actual screen on my real laptop. It just has access to its own notes.

### 📝 セクション 20

It creates its own folders. It manages this system. So this is technically my agent's computer, which is why it's so malleable, because anything that happens here is only constrained to what's happened here. So in other words, the blast radius of anything going haywire won't affect my finances, my credit cards, or my files in general, which is a piece of mind if it's something within reach because you can manage everything and you can also manage what's being installed, how it's being used. >> I'm even considering the investment myself now just so I can tinker around over it over over the next week or so.

### 💡 セクション 21

And uh once you set it up, it comes with its own localhosted command center. So this is the Cloudbot command center. This gives you an overview over how long it's been connected, how many instances it has. Uh if it has jobs that it runs over and over again in the form of what's called a cron, when you speak to it, let's say via Telegram like I do, it can decide, okay, cool. It looks like Mark wants to run this reminder to go check his YouTube competitors and look at their comments using the app scraper every hour or every 3 hours.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And this is where the proactivity comes in because it basically pings its own server and it messages me whatever I'm looking for. And then a part of that picture is obviously skills. So like you have normal cloud skills, these are all open- source skills. So these skills let it use things like the Apple reminders, write its own notes, watch for blogs, take a screenshot of its own environment. So it can be literally be like, am I doing the right thing?

### 🎯 セクション 23

As if it's like your actual virtual assistant. >> Yep. So these are a lot of these come out of the box in the in the setup wizard, which is helpful, right? So this is I think a huge leap forward. this is is that these come out of the box and a lot of the integrations like the 11 labs one which we can showcase in a second but instead of the like clunkiness of MCPs and now bloated those can be these skills now seem to be forming as like the new unit of like integration or as as a feature and the fact that we'll be able to like browse marketplaces for these and figure out what we want to plug in very quickly to our uh to our personal like Jarvis here um I think is is super exciting for for non techies especially >> yeah and just the TLDDR for people on difference between skills and MCP.

### 💭 セクション 24

A skill is like a constrained set of let's say endpoints or different functionalities from a service. Let's use 11 Labs as an example. If you want to clone a voice, if you want to generate something with an existing voice, those are two different functions. So, skill just creates a cheat sheet in plain English with those functions and it tells whatever LM it is, this is how to use it and this is when to use it. And the core difference is an MCP is kind of always on, meaning it's bloating your context window of your conversation, which might push the agent to time out.

### 📌 セクション 25

A skill is invoked just in time, meaning whenever it's needed, it'll be used. >> Yep. Love it. I think that's future for sure. And I I think even Anthropic kind of admitted that MCB wasn't the way forward um by by making the transition over to Skills >> 100%.

### ✅ セクション 26

So um we already spoke about the cloudbot environment. You can connect it to whatever you want. Discord, iMessage, Signal, whatever makes you happy. A lot of this stuff comes out of the box. You just have to hook it up.

### 📚 セクション 27

If you choose WhatsApp, I think you have to just scan a QR code and it hooks up to your personal number. So, one disclaimer for your audience is if you want to separate your life, which I recommend that you do if you're not a cyber security expert yet, it's probably better to use something like Telegram, especially because the blast radius of something going wrong is probably a lot lower. Yeah. And then when it comes to um where you can interface with it, you can also do Google chat, Microsoft Teams, etc. So I only allude to that because there is a business opportunity here if you can figure out how to set this up, securely, and use it because most of your clients are using something like that, >> securely.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Yeah. I mean, just like scratching the surface of how this can be set up as a as a service, which we'll go into in a second, is uh it's huge opportunity here. >> And then behind the scenes, just in case you're still okay, let's say you know cloud code. So if I say the words claude code then when I say claude MD might mean something to you. Claude MD is like the brain of how claude code operates every session.

### 🎨 セクション 29

It's kind of like the the values the holy book >> like priming. >> Yeah. >> Exactly. Exactly. So the priming here is a bit different.

### 🚀 セクション 30

When you onboard Cloudbot it asks you questions about how it should behave. So it's fully going the personal assistant angle. Literally ask me when you're wrong Mark. Do you want me to be direct and tell you wrong or do you want me to be soft or passive about it? So, it interviews you in natural language and then it stores your preferences in its soul.mmarkdown file.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, it's literally called soul.mmarkdown. Then asks you what it should identify as by name, creature, etc. So, it out of the box in 15 minutes once you have it installed, it's ready to go. It knows how to speak to you. I told it I like lowercase.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I write in lowercase. Don't give me some cookie cutter stuff. Don't say I'm absolutely right. and then we were ready to go. >> Now, we might have this just after this, but when it comes to building in your workflows to this, so you've got your workspace set up, you might provide it with uh the some like market research data or uh sort of key components and and documents about your business.

### 🎬 セクション 33

How then are you needing to create custom skills or are there like simple commands that you can set up? How do you then start to make workflows on top of this? So, one tool that I like to use quite a bit, you can use whatever you want. Any form of IDE where it can do stuff is helpful. I like to use warp because it has a free tier.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, what I like to do is I just go and I say, "Hey, can you go interface with Claudebot? I don't feel like building a skill, but can you go and figure out how to use insert X API?" Let's say we want to do the Hen API to make a copy of ourselves. Go look at the Hen API. see what you need from me and see what would it take to make a skill. Then once it creates a skill, it stores it behind the scenes and it tells Claudebot in its like identity and its tools file, make sure that when Mark says clone or avatar, we use this heygen skill.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So that's one avenue. Another avenue is once you have it set it up well, you can actually ask Claudebot to create the skill itself. So once in a while I'll ask it, I have a challenge for you. I don't know how you're going to do this, but I have this voice note from Liam. I want you to take this voice note and I want you to clone his voice somehow using 11 laps.

### 📝 セクション 36

I'm not gonna tell you how. I'm not going to tell you where. You have the API key. Go figure it out. So, it will go 5 10 minutes, try a couple things, then come back and figure it out.

### 💡 セクション 37

Okay. So, if we pop in, you can see this is my beautiful assistant Claudet. I actually asked her to make her own profile picture and I asked her, can you tell me what Liam's last three videos were about? So behind the scenes I gave it access to ampify specifically the MCP just to make it easier. It went kind of scraped it turns back the link >> closing quickly on that.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Ampify is a great thing to have integrated because of it like depth of different scrapers. Right? So that's just like a very easy general purpose uh connection you can make to give your your clawbot a ton more capability. Right. So it can find a LinkedIn scraper if it needs to and use that and it's just all set up through through your appy account.

### 🎯 セクション 39

You're going to get ping for those actors. >> Exactly. So, if you go to, it's a great segue. Go to mcp.appfi.com. You could see out of the box.

### 💭 セクション 40

You can just set everything up. Then you can click any one of these. This is what I did. I literally just clicked on warp. Uh, it gives me the request that I need to send.

### 📌 セクション 41

Or you could do, let's say, cloud code. You just give it this command. You paste that. You tell it, can you go learn how to use the appy mcp and then you can add whatever actors you want. So, in this case, you can just literally go select them, click save, then you're good to go.

### ✅ セクション 42

And then >> so you manually add those in or there is a like when it uses the search function there. Is it going to search from the ones you've enabled or is it going to search the whole uh the whole database of of actors? >> You're asking the right questions. So out of the box I manually put ones in that I know for a fact I want always. So that's where I added them here.

### 📚 セクション 43

And then you just have to enable it to search actors and call actors. And then if it's not there, if it doesn't have, let's say, a LinkedIn scraper, it can go and search for an actor that's highly rated and then add that to its stack. >> That's super helpful. >> That's how we got these YouTube videos. And then this is the part where it's super cool.

### 🔖 セクション 44

I sent it a voice note um just to better understand what's happening. And like I asked it, can you create a clone of the following voice note that I'm about to send you? So it I basically gave it this voice note of Liam swearing at me for being late to this pod. and then listened to it. And then I said, "Can you use this file to clone his voice and send me a sample of the clone telling me that he loves me?" Now, I would love to play this, but Liam kind of muffled his own voice on purpose, so it was going to sound super goofy.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Do you want me to play it or what? >> Yeah, I mean, I I haven't heard this. Is it my bad American accent? >> Hey, Mark, I love you, man. This voice cloning technology is absolutely >> That does sound like how I sounded in the voice.

### 🚀 セクション 46

>> In the future. Hey Mark. >> Yeah, Mark. Man, that's what I sound like. >> Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 47

And then I said, um, can you voice note me uh a breakdown of Liam's channel strategy from what you can see? And super interesting that I want to show your audience here is >> that started glazing me immediately. >> Yeah. I mean, that's part two. That's part two.

### 🌟 セクション 48

But part one is it ran this job that I told it to do to look for my YouTube competitor. So then it found the last few people in the last few hours that had a video around Claude. So I was just like in the middle of it. But here's the part glazing you. >> All right, let's break down Liam Ali's channel strategy.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So Liam is at 724K subs right now. He's absolutely crushing it in the AI automation space. And his whole strategy is built around this concept he created called the AAA model, AI automation agency. >> We got the idea. So that's that you're asking it for a Did did you ask it to give a audio summary there or is that >> references?

### 📋 セクション 50

>> Yeah. Send send me a voice note. Now Le's channel strategy, but nothing else. >> Cool. I mean, so my my questions here is like there's the difference between like a general purpose assistant that has been given enough tools and access to stuff that it can just figure out on its own versus a bit more of a structured one like uh say like I've just been setting up a a claw code workspace for myself for like as a podcasting workspace to help me research competitors, uh research guests, um do a quick like kind of snapshot of the market, see what's trending or a snapshot of my competitors and these kind core like not necessarily full skills but just like a clawed command that has a it's a markdown file with a couple things and telling it how to use different parts of the like the readme inside of it any scripts as well.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Um so where's the sort of middle ground for this between like this completely free form assistant who's just got the ability to problem solve anything that you needed to and these very structured workflows. I mean you could even say the old AI tools we used to have where it's like input input pass them into a prompt it comes out. How do you ensure consistency for some of these tasks? Like do you need to provide it with an example of what you want this research report to look like in the same way that you do it for the say the podcasting environment I'm setting up. Um how have you sort of split it down the middle there where you would kind of want the report to come back in the same structure each time.

### 📝 セクション 52

Um you do want certain things to be included. >> No, that's awesome. So the way again this is brand new, right? like the >> expecting you to like explain your workflow patterns. You got your your Mac like 6 hours ago.

### 💡 セクション 53

Well, it's more of like a discussion like where's it? Cuz sometimes you're going to want like I kind of want it this way. And I suppose it can it can help you to create those those patterns, right? And and create those templates for it to fill up. >> Yeah.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So, for me, this is very like on the- go things that I wish my executive assistant could do without me having to overexlain and kind of like direct here and here and here. like let's say like tell me about the latest video that came out today that went viral like those kinds of things really good at because it can abstract those skills but for me I have like eight claude code command centers so if I'm trying to send an RFP or a proposal to a client I have I'm very particular like I usually go through three four iterations until I get it I don't want to wait because the thing is now that's on Telegram your mamillion brain is programmed to wait for like what a minute or two before you get a response if it takes 10 minutes you start losing it but when you're instead of in front of cloud code, you know that you have to go grab a coffee and come back before any magic happens. So, different platforms for different parts of your workflow, at least for now. >> AI maxing >> is basically what it is like plugging plugging a a certain need or scratching a certain itch with a different type of uh AI at every every part of your your daily life. So, um yeah, this is super super interesting, man.

### 🎯 セクション 55

of how this rolls out, whether it's like eventually it consolidates into just one thing that you're using um or you still have a couple dedicated workspaces you set up for certain things. Yeah, it's just it's interesting because when I give it its own laptop to work on and let's say it does something wrong. So, one thing that we're going to talk about shortly as little Debbie Downers is what happens when it comes to security. So, I saw a bunch of tweets saying, you know, this is insecure, this is insecure, be careful of this. I taught it to scrape X.

### 💭 セクション 56

So then I started sending it all the tweets saying, can you make sure we're covered on these security things? And then it made its own notes in its notes folder on like the things that were covered for what it needs to implement. So it can even make its own to-do list. You don't need an obsidian. You don't need a notion.

### 📌 セクション 57

You could it has the same access as an employee with a laptop. And that's why all the use cases that need to exist don't exist yet. >> Man, it's exciting, man. >> It's insane. But we do have to talk about the elephant in the room, the crab in the room, which is security.

### ✅ セクション 58

So if you go on X, you'll find tons of people warning, sounding the alarms that this is actually a picture of people around the world that have spun up Clawbot on a server. So this is the blast radius of chaos. And if you don't know what you're doing, yes, it can be cheaper than buying a two grand Mac Mini, but if you don't know what you're doing, there's so many vectors that an IT person or a hacker can use to get access to your personal laptop, your WhatsApp, your funds, your credit cards. So even though this is super cool, well, I'm going to like emphasize this, there are a lot of consequences if you don't separate your life. So even when when I created my employee Clawudette, she has her own iCloud account.

### 📚 セクション 59

She has her own brand new email. Everything is completely separate from me. >> And so what's the like where's the the danger zone? Is it if you're running this locally on your own machine and it has access to all of your stuff on your on your uh main machine. >> Yes.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So you have different tiers. Tier one, let's say you're purely local. So you have a local model. It's in Docker and you're running it locally. The only blast radius is it might nuke all your files on your computer, right?

### 🎨 セクション 61

If you if it's actually on your personal computer. Number two is if you run it and it's using the cloud and you are giving it your actual WhatsApp and you have a bunch of what are called ports open for different services. If you don't secure those ports, people can take advantage of those and once they're in one, they can find their way to tunnel into the rest of your services or files or whatever. That's number two. >> So that's mainly like a a a breach of what you thought were private files, right?

### 🚀 セクション 62

like if you've got I don't know API keys or you've got login and password or I hope you're not chucking those in the MD files. But um yeah, personal stuff that you don't want don't want getting out there. >> Yeah. And then there's even there's more tiers. Again, I'm not the full expert, so do your own due diligence, but like even with the keys that you give it, let's say you give it the 11 Labs API key.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Let's say you give it the I don't know, GitHub. A lot of people are using it for GitHub where they're like, you know what, go look on my vibe coded app while I sleep. go come up with a series of improvements and work on it until I wake up. Theoretically, beautiful. But behind the scenes, if you give it full access to all of your GitHub and let's say you're an agency and you have actual client projects and someone gets a handle for that GitHub and you've enabled the key to access everything, not just one repo, it could be a disaster.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So, >> okay, just scoping scoping those keys is important. >> Yeah. So, just scoping that out. And I have a little bit of a checklist here. Again, not meant to glaze over your eyes of the audience, but if you want to deploy it locally, there's this mode called sandbox mode.

### 🎬 セクション 65

All I did is literally asked Warp to talk to Cloudbot and make sure we running in sandbox mode. Um, if you want to self-host, obviously local models is the safest way. If you have credentials and secrets, make sure that you put them into secrets managers. You don't share sensitive files. You you don't just put a series of API keys in like an open JSON that anyone can access.

### 📋 セクション 66

And then you have all kinds of things around monitoring, making sure that maybe you have a cap on your API keys, so you don't have a thousand dollars on anthropic API ready to go. Maybe you got like 20 bucks and it reloads for five bucks every single time. So there's layers of fail safes. So this is all we know now, but there's going to be a lot more because I'm pretty sure someone's going to take advantage of this. >> Yeah.

### ⭐ セクション 67

So Mark and I had a bit of a brainstorm on ways to make money with this. And these are obviously very early stage. A lot of it is kind of arbitrage, but it does go back to the kind of core core principles of of the AI agency and and AI services. So, uh, the obvious one here is that with great power comes great opportunity. Oh, I literally made that up on the spot, but that makes a lot of sense.

### 📝 セクション 68

When there's new powers and there's new new there's Jarvis in a on a on a local machine, uh, businesses are going to be or some businesses, if you can position it correctly, are going to be interested in paying for this. So that would involve you starting off just uh setting it up for yourself. Do the uh do the cloud host version first. Get a feel for it. Once you're sure you've kind of figured out the best workflows for it, how to set them up quickly, you could look to do it yourself.

Purchase one locally and then use that as a as a template uh to offer that to businesses as well. Um small businesses in your area saying, "Hey, I can set this up for you." The big issue here is the education gap on what the hell this is. cuz you guys are probably already an AI enthusiast and you're watching this to try to just like understand this uh as the rest of us are. So there's going to be a huge gap between where you are and communicating this value. It's likely going to be one of those cases of where don't really tell them what like tell them what what they're going to get out of it.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Don't try to explain all the AI stuff under the hood. Just like I can do X for you. Um here's how much it costs. Like do you want this result? um probably a personal assistant set up for a founder or a CEO or a seuite person um is uh the way to go here.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Someone who's got uh a lot of the the time is very valuable. And like Mark said, having a personal assistant that can sort of have the ability to access the right things and and do little uh little admin tasks for them and offering that as a service to sell those to businesses or even to individuals maybe to like targeting entrepreneurs who are busy and want to have more time. Uh so setting these up for them would be a great service. I would also add in set up as a service, set up as a education product as well. Like you could drop a $97 course right now on how to get the most out of it and set it up.

### 💭 セクション 72

And as long as you have the the the means to market it, then that's an opportunity as well. So either the service based approach and then the uh the info approach. Uh the service one's probably going to be again it's always like how effectively can you market? If you have an audience already, then it's probably easier to sell the sell the information. If you are starting off, it's easy to do reachouts to find one or two people who will pay you a few grand for this uh rather than trying to get thousands of people to buy your $97 course.

### 📌 セクション 73

All right, so the VA agency, not to knock our VA friends, but it's no secret that we're probably not far from the point where a lot of normal VA tasks are genuinely fully automatable and it's affordable and it's cheaper than the 6 to 10 bucks an hour that you'd spend. So the opportunity here is the assistance in a box kind of like business in a box but imagine you have let's say a one-time setup that setup could be again on cloud you could literally sell them with a premium a Mac mini and install it and set it up for them and install the packages and then you have >> can already I could already see the pics on you know how you see like the the like the SMS or the WhatsApp bot farms and it's like the phones in it or it's like the the gambling bot farms and it's all these gambling things of Um, I can already see it, bro. All the Mac minis lined up and it's like my Clawude VA agency prints like 2 million a month or something ridiculous. Yeah, I can already see it. We're going to start they're going to come from one of these videos for sure.

### ✅ セクション 74

>> Yeah, that's our contribution to the world. But yeah, like the theoretical thing is if you can figure out how to make this genuinely useful, like everything I'm showing you here, right? I want to pull this from my other screen because I think it's useful. one year ago almost like to the day. If I just refresh this bad boy and we take a look at this, like this was the hottest thing on YouTube, which is the nadn Jarvis where you manually had to set up all these agents, all these nodes.

### 📚 セクション 75

These would break all the time as you wanted to change things, but every time you wanted to add something new, teach it something, you can't teach it something. You can only build it something that it can learn. So, we're going from this into a world that's a lot more plentiful. And with that, you can upsell adding skills, you can make those skills like across the board. You can um upsell maintenance, you can upsell future proofing, all kinds of stuff.

### 🔖 セクション 76

>> I mean, you can use these if you have an upfront setup fee. You charge them, you buy the Mac Mini, you set it up, uh, and you have like a obviously an SOP on, okay, we want the Ampify MCP plugged in in a certain way. We want these default skills out of the box. And you've got like an SOP on how to set one of these up. And then there's a bit of a teething process to get them working on it.

### 🎨 セクション 77

You're setting up the telegram, you're giving them access to it. Um, that's that's repeatable. And I mean even thinking about how you can add more value to uh to them on top of that you can have a hey I'm going to analyze your transcripts occasionally whether you e either create a skill that is almost like a like a workflow tracer and it will actually look back the conversation figure out what it used and when and then be able to like bake that into a skill itself or like build it into some sort of reusable workflow. so much to to to build off of here, but I think you guys can see the value in it. And before you know it, like if each client is paying 2K setup and then in a recurring fee, $500 or $1,000 a month, um you can very quickly spawn that whole like the whole room or or warehouse full of Mac monies running for your clients.

### 🚀 セクション 78

>> And I would even say like a play on words a little bit, but if you remember, I talked about that soul.md file that contains like behavior. What if you got the perfect behavior of the perfect assistant and you started, wait for it, selling soul MD files and like being able to offer that like personal assistant service prompt ready to go. People have paid for prompts before. I made my early living on that. So I know they'll do it again.

### ⚡ セクション 79

And the last one, sir, uh the customer integrations here, building custom skills and automations. I think this is like the new SAS. Basically, this is the in future we're going to be relying pretty heavily on on these these kinds of personal assistants and the adding of skills. Uh we had we once had MCPs. Uh we had chat GBT plugins.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Like all of these are just attempts for platforms and providers and SAS products to be able to hook into the chat interface in a in an easy way and give access to the functionality that they've built their backend functionality via the chat interface. Like the chat interface is the new is the new uh access point for everything in our digital lives. And I think what we're looking at here is an incredible opportunity. I I wouldn't quite say the App Store moment yet because we haven't got the App Store, but this is like is this is this the is this the iPhone moment where like the the the thing is there. We've now got like the open source iPhone where you can kind of build things on top of cuz it's it's so tech bro to try and like the most tech bro thing to try and like call it a the X and Y.

### 🎬 セクション 81

But where you don't have to have if you're wanting to make a little little startup now, for example, the amount of people who need to be able to pass in a YouTube URL and download the MP3 and then get the proper transcription, a high quality whisper transcription of it, not just some shitty like YouTube captions thing that has no punctuation and barely knows what was said. Um, I want a highquality transcription and I'm going to pay someone uh five bucks a month, $9 a month. And before you know it, someone who has one of these clawed account, our claw bot account set up. And just like there's going to be agencies who pop up to like as in the previous example, these really helpful but somewhat more difficult and naturally not free. Uh there's some sort of like money that needs to be um exchanged hands to make it worthwhile.

### 📋 セクション 82

these opportunities are going to pop up everywhere. And I think you're going to see some businesses that just explode overnight because as more people get onto this and it's like, "Oh, this is the go-to thing for downloading YouTube videos so that my agent has ability to do that." Um, you get to strip away the need for a fancy interface and and UI and front-end design and all of that crap that comes with SAS. Just focus on what is the functionality that I want to really focus on. How can I make that as valuable as possible? And just make that available to some agents like this where I'm getting listed on a marketplace doing my own marketing.

### ⭐ セクション 83

But there's a real real opportunity here finally and I think it's massively reduced the difficulty bar for getting into SAS and that you just focus on the backend functionality make it available to agents rather than having to build some fancy skin around it. >> Yeah, absolutely. And I would say one more thing to think about is when it comes to the skills specifically those like are going to become expectations and to me this might not be a moment. I don't want to cap and say that, but what we could say is this is the beginning of a brand new expectation from the consumer. Meaning once this really gets into mainstream, it's already going viral.

### 📝 セクション 84

The expectation of what a personal assistant is is going to be much higher. So when Siri uses Gemini, I think this year they're going to like work together and next year we have laptops, people will start asking the question, why is Siri just a voice thing? Why can't she interact with everything and do X, Y, and Z? So expectations from the consumer will change from this point onwards. >> I mean when you see this being rolled out into well the equivalent Apple attempting surely if solo dev can can uh can cook this up himself by what's the sound of uh what happened here then Apple can make some sort of decent competitor.

### 💡 セクション 85

But going back to what I was saying about these sort of like little little skills or or or functionalities that these kinds of agents are going to need once it becomes rolled out via something like Siri and those same things can be integrated whether Apple's going to force you to do it through an app on their phone or they're going to say hey what you know what we have to allow people to go outside of the Apple ecosystem. Um we want our Siri for our Siri to be competitive. it needs to be able to hook into. We can give permissions for them to add in their own third party things that are kind of out in the out in the ether. I don't know how Apple I feel about that if I'm honest, but dreams are free, you know, >> 100%.

### 🔧 セクション 86

>> Um, so yeah, that's a bunch of ways to make money with it. I think uh if you guys have any sort of business sense, you'll be smelling a bit of opportunity here. not only just for us in the near term to brush up on this and to get our own one set up and see how far we can push it to max out our productivity in this new era of of AI that we've we've similarly stepped into here. Uh but also looking at how if you're an agency you can roll this into your services. Uh just like a few days ago I was telling everyone how teaching companies how to understand claw code and set up their own workspaces as a service was a thing.

### 🎯 セクション 87

This seems to be like the the new frontier on that. So yeah, it's just it's so great to be in this phase now. I think uh last year was a little bit slow, but I feel like we're absolutely like cooking this year on new releases and I'm so excited for uh for what's to come this year based off what we've had already. >> Yeah, it's already not even the end of 2026 and it feels like it's been a year. So especially on the education side, you could have taught Claude code alone.

### 💭 セクション 88

Then a week later, you could teach cloud code and co-work. And now you could teach cloud code, co-work, and cloudbot. And then you could probably keep stacking on top of that. So >> the education piece is is huge and like as the stuff runs off further into the distance, companies are still in the same spot and the the amount of like monetizable space between where the tech is and where these companies are. The same the automation that was available in sort of mid 2023 that like millions of businesses still need is is still sitting there.

### 📌 セクション 89

Um all the way up to uh this stuff at the at the very uh cutting edge of of what's going on in the AI space now. So uh what a time to be alive. what it's time to be in this uh in this space. So Mark, mate, I really appreciate you coming on and uh sharing your sharing your source uh as always. And so if you guys want to check out Mark's channel, he's always pumping out some great content on claw code.

### ✅ セクション 90

Um well, Claudebot as well now, I'm sure. And anything at the at the cutting edge of uh of AI. So I appreciate you, brother. Thank you for coming on. >> Thanks for having me again.
