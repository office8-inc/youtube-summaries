## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

My name is David Andre and in this video I'm going to show you how to build an entire app from scratch using AI. So first you need to choose which tool you use. So I'm going to be using cursor with cloth code. So let me open an empty project. Boom.

### 📋 背景・概要

This is literally an empty folder I created a few minutes ago. As you can see there is nothing here in my files. Now the reason I want to use cursor is because it's a full IDE. If you use something like bold lovable replet these are fine. You can get an MVP running but you cannot develop serious software in them.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So that's why I'm using cursor. Then I'm going to open the terminal with command J. I'm going to type in clot. This will launch clot code. I'm going to be using clot code as my main coding agent.

### 📝 詳細説明

It's asking for permission to live in this project. So I'm going to enable that. Next, we need to create a new file that's going to be named build-a.md. And in here, this is a markdown file, which is a type of text basically similar to a text file. We're going to describe what we're building.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So again, each project is different, but I described a simple idea here, which is a link tracking tool. So URL attribution analytics this is something I actually need myself to track you know which videos provide more traffic stuff like that and get more analytics about it. So the way I got this is I described the idea into cloth and I asked to generate. So literally you could just say hey I want to create a link tracking tool give me the text tag for it. It will give you a similar file right but since I did that already we're going to launch another cloud code.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So let me type in cloud again. You can have multiple uh coding agents running at the same time. So I'm going to do this one and I'm going to say read build idea to understand what I want to build. Do not write any code yet. There's the answer.

### 🎯 応用例

So the next step is to actually have it build the next JS app. Now get to work and build the entire Nex.js app exactly as the build idea creates. Let's focus on the setup. Build it as an MVP. We're going to make it good later.

### 💭 考察

All right. So I'm using Super Whisper to speak this which is speaking is faster than typing, right? Even though I type very fast like 120 words per minute, I speak probably 200 words per minute. So, so now Cloud Core is building this. We're going to need to initialize Git repository.

### 📌 まとめ

So, I can go back to this one and I can do /clear to reset the chat. I'll say give me the necessary terminal commands for me to initialize a new Git repository here inside of my project. I want to do them myself. Think harder. Answer in short.

### ✅ 結論

So even if you don't know how to use git or GitHub, you can ask the coding agents, the AI tools how to do it, which is exactly what I'm doing right now. So as you can see, it's just free commands. So I'm going to do get initialize a G get repository in this project. Git add dot to add everything to stage all files and then get commit and then first commit to do the first commit. There we go.

### 📚 追加情報

The next step would be to connect GitHub. Now tell me how I can connect my GitHub repo to this. Give me step-by-step instructions. I'll do them myself. All right.

### 🔖 補足

So, as you can see, this clot code is building stuff or it needs to it needs my permissions to run riskier terminal commands. But this clot code, you can see uh note this first cloud code is helping me do stuff while the other one is building the code. So, we're going to go to GitHub if you don't have a GitHub account takes 60 seconds to create. It's completely free. So, github.com/new is how you create a new repo.

### 🎨 セクション 13

I'm going to say building app from scratch. Okay. And we can uh make it actually I can make it public. Why not? And we don't need a readme.

### 🚀 セクション 14

We don't need a get. Okay, we don't need anything. So, let's create the repo. We just need this. We need to copy this right here.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, copy that. This is the URL. We're going back to cursor. And so, we did create the repo right now. Now, is to say get remote at is the repo.

### 🌟 セクション 16

What's the issue? Oh, we need to add origin. Okay, that's my bad. Get remote at origin and then the link. Boom.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And then we do get branch- m. So, we set the main branch. You can name it master as well. Really doesn't matter. Git push-u.

### 📋 セクション 18

This is upstream tracking origin main. You don't have to understand all these things. You just ask the AI how to do it and then you do it. So now if we go here and reload, we should have our build idea MD. You can see that we successfully pushed our local project to GitHub.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So it is now on GitHub which will allow us to easily version track, easily deploy it on all other sites and just work with it everywhere. So knowing how to use GitHub and how to deploy projects on GitHub is absolutely essential when building software. And now what we need to do is we need to actually unblock this clot code to build it. It's having some trouble. So I'm going to say just tell me which terminal commands to run and I'll run them myself.

### 📝 セクション 20

You'll do all the coding. So I'm using multiple cloud codes. This one is more like a consultant. I can rename that advisor and this one is more of the developer. It's a benefit of using u coding agents.

### 💡 セクション 21

You can use multiple of them. Okay. Move the existing file temporarily. All right. Well, it's not about it.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It should be in docs. So I'll just create a new folder docs and move that in there. And we need to run this. Create an XJS app. It got some issues with permissions.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So React compiler anytime you're not sure guys if what to do whether you know do yes or no. Say what do I select and just ask the AI. This is probably the biggest difference between like beginners and advanced people. Advanced people use AI to upskill upskill themselves. beginners only blindly follow what AS says.

### 💭 セクション 24

So okay, React compiler is experimental. We don't want to do that. We want to use proven text tag to keep things simple. We also should probably create uh so say create a comprehensive git ignore file that covers build ID. I'm going to tag our build idea spec in the root of our project.

### 📌 セクション 25

Switch to auto accept. All right. So now our next chest project is being created. Before we push it, obviously we want the get ignore so that we don't push any sensitive stuff like env files. All right, so that's done.

### ✅ セクション 26

We move the file back. We need to move the file install superbase. Okay, so I'm going to do that. Clear. Clear the terminal.

### 📚 セクション 27

Install superbase. The text tag is very simple here. We're going next.js for everything and then suabase for the database. And we're going to use VEL to deploy and open router for the AI features if we need any. All right.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So I'm going to say done. Check if all ran successfully. And I'm going to tell I chose /docs instead for the MD files. Answer in short. Think harder.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Answer in short. So think harder is not just a prompting trick. It actually influences the reasoning effort that cloud models use. That's why you're going to see me use this. All right.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So we need to approve this. I don't know why we need to approve this every time. Maybe we need to create a cloth folder. Um so for that we can actually use perplexity browse the web to figure out how to create uh the settings JSON file for clo code so that we can give it a list of allowed commands so that it doesn't keep asking me for permission every single time and then also give me a good JSON file with safe terminal commands that we can give for AI agents. The reason I like perplexity deep research is because it's a good balance between depth and quickness.

### ⚡ セクション 31

You know, if you look at OpenAI deep research or cloud deep research, they're too like look at this. It was like 20 seconds. Beautiful. And it already reviewed 20 sources. OpenAI or Entropic, they have a very long deep research.

### 🌟 セクション 32

It's not like adaptable. So, yeah, Perplex is ideal at working fast. So, we need to create this file. So, I'm just going to delegate that u create a file at this location. Boom.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Then I'm going to do another push to GitHub. So I'm going to do we have the get ignore, right? Let me check. Get ignore is right here. Okay.

### 📋 セクション 34

So I'm going to do get add dot getit commit created next.js app get push. You should do uh get commit like every 10 to 15 minutes. It's good practice to just be able to revert, right? So boom, it's going to search for this. Whatever.

### ⭐ セクション 35

We can create that manually if this doesn't work. All right. This AI agent is building the app. It's creating the schema page. TSX.

### 📝 セクション 36

I don't know why I deleted everything. Oh, it was probably preconfigured. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So, it was from the default XJS creation and now it's built. So, the MVP is super super simple code base as you can see.

### 💡 セクション 37

Uh, what is this guy doing? All right, it wants to create the claw directory or it's creating in this uh create that inside of this project, not root of my MacBook. I think that's uh my fault for pasting that. Yeah, we should have told him to create in the root of his project. Okay, so there we go.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Now we need to create the JSON file. Basic structure this stops permission pro save commands create a list. Right, that's not what I want. I just want this create empty settings file. Okay, I'm going to do JSON.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Boom. Paste this in. You have to do command V, not actually control V. Uh for next line, you need to do Ctrl J. You cannot do shift enter.

### 💭 セクション 40

That will just send a message. Okay, JSON and we say update the JSON to ensure it has all these commands. Do not change anything else. So this will help us work faster with cloud code because it's not going to be asking for permission for every little thing. It's always good to work faster and optimized but without you know without wide listing any risky commands.

### 📌 セクション 41

So I think what we need to do is probably restart. We'll see. We'll see if it keeps asking or not. And uh now we need to import to versel. So I'm going to ask now give me step by step how to deploy this on Versell.

### ✅ セクション 42

Think harder answer in short. So I already am logged into my Versell. So we're going to need to add a new project I guess. But hey, let's just follow the instructions because if you've never done this, you will not have that knowledge. U so we're going to follow what what Cloud Code tells us.

### 📚 セクション 43

It says we should do another get commit. say created.cloth folder it pushed. It's not a consequential commit but let's add it. Boom. So anytime we do this we should see a new comets on our GitHub.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So you can see right there free commits and the latest is right now we have the cloth folder. Maybe we can ignore that. Depends up to use your preference. Okay. So then we go to the cell sign up and login import project repo.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So let's do that. Add new project. We need to import g repository. So that's on me and it's this one. Import.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Okay. Framework. Let's see. Select your repo. Add environment variables.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So these are the superbase ones. We haven't set that up because I didn't set up the superb base yet. So we're going to do that later. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a screenshot. Paste that here.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Just so cloud code confirms everything. To paste the screenshot, you need to do control V, not command V. I'll say check the attached file to ensure all is good and tell me the next steps. Answer in short this AI agents are very verbose, right? So saying answer in short is a good practice in general and it's also good to try to understand what's happening.

### 🎬 セクション 49

You know we should use XJS that's our text stack root directory that's probably good or actually maybe src. Okay, looks good root directory. Okay, expand arrival of variables. There we go. And we should add these two.

### 📋 セクション 50

We haven't Okay, we haven't created the superbase project yet. So, should I leave this empty for now? Probably. Yeah. So, I'm going to skip that and just uh deploy because we don't have any environment files.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Yes, deploy without them. All right. So now it's going to pull it from GitHub versus project settings. Okay. Yeah, you can we can always change those.

### 📝 セクション 52

It's not a problem. And Versell is obviously the easiest choice for next.js text stack. But if you're using different text stack, different options are like render, Roku, Netlifi, Railway, plenty of other deployment options. All right, deployment failed. Okay, let's actually do a local one.

### 💡 セクション 53

Create superase project. Okay, we need a superbase project to run. I guess change the MVP so that it runs even without the superbase setup. We will add that later. The fewer lines of code the better.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's another prompt you'll see me use often. Now, in the meantime, we can actually do the superbase setup. There's no need reason to delay that. So, I'm going to create a new org probably from scratch. I'm going to name it um YouTube testing type personal.

### 🎯 セクション 55

We're going to start the free plan. We don't need the paid plan for this. Okay. Project name app from scratch. We need a database password.

### 💭 セクション 56

So, we can just uh do something very irresponsible. Write a simple Python script that generates a random string of 24 characters the moment I run it in terminal and put it inside of scripts folder in the project. So I'm just going to build my own generation because it's just faster than using something on the web and also will teach you a bit of Python. In the meantime, we can do cond list to see my cond environments. I'm going to do cond activate testing.

### 📌 セクション 57

So this is for Python environment management. Then we're going to need to do Python scripts slashgenerate secret. We're going to wait for it to finish writing it. And now we're going to run it. Boom.

### ✅ セクション 58

Here's our password, a random string. So, I'm going also going to save that in my password manager on the left. Okay. Boom. So, basically, we just build our own password generator.

### 📚 セクション 59

Very simple. So, let's go back. We type it in. It is strong enough. Region Europe.

### 🔖 セクション 60

That's good to me. Generate. Obviously, do not share our database password. I'll delete this before uh we do anything. Right.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, um what's next? We have the super basease copy keys. Okay, we need to copy the env keys right here. So these are like project settings GW API keys. It's always hidden here.

### 🚀 セクション 62

The new API keys for better support. Okay, we need a publishable key and let's check. I'm going to take a full screenshot with the entire UI and we'll say paste it in. Which uh API keys do we actually need? Think harder answer in short because we don't need everything.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Maybe if we add authentication later, we need like the JWT secret as well. All right. So now we use local storage. So actually this we can probably refer this because I'm just adding the superbase. So but let's run it locally.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Why not? Let's let's test it if things work. All right. Locals 3000 link track login. Sign up.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Very bad UI. Test. Test. Sign up. All right.

### 📋 セクション 66

So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to use Gemini 3 Pro to read build idea and update the design and UI of our front end to make it look better. Do not change anything else. Do not add or remove any features. Just focus on improving the design and layout. It's very important because GE I don't know Gemini is just inside of cursor changes a lot.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Do not change anything else. I'm going to repeat them once again with three exclamation points. This is also good to know like which models are good at different things. So Gemini free right now probably best the front end. So now it's changing the code to accommodate for the actual names of our columns and tables replace query RBC calls and quite grouping.

### 📝 セクション 68

Okay. Does this follow both build idea and master plan answer in short I just want to make sure we're following what we're actually building because sometimes the AI agents can get carried away and do stuff that we didn't plan on doing. So, never hurts to just reference the original files. And again, the build idea is a link tracking basically URL attribution. So, when you're a content creator or when you're doing like paid ads or SEO, whatever, you just want to make sure you know where the traffic is coming and have some an analytics about this traffic.

### 💡 セクション 69

Obviously, stuff like this already exists, but I'm trying to build my own simple solution. Yes, it followed both docs. Okay. Is the dashboard fully built out? So, I'm going to say check the actual Nex.js JS code and read master plan again.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Do not make any changes. Just answer in short. Seems like now we should uh redeploy to Versell. We had the error last time. Inspect deployment blah blah blah.

### 🎯 セクション 71

We probably redeploy. Let's do deploy again. We had a bunch of comments since last time mostly at bing master. Okay. Okay.

### 💭 セクション 72

So, we need to add analytics. Let's check. So we should Okay. Tell me how to check here on localhost that the superbase connection works well. Give me step by step answer in short because we've designed the front end redesigned it and we've u you know tested that it runs locally but we haven't tested the superbase login.

### 📌 セクション 73

So this should be correct. Simple npm rundev. So we need to restart the front end probably. Actually, we probably don't, but anytime. Wait, did we update the envy file?

### ✅ セクション 74

Yes, we did. All right. So, let's do that. npm rundev. We should go to this URL.

### 📚 セクション 75

Sign up. Create account with real email and password. So, I'm going to use my email. Password. We can do test one, two, three, 4.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Let's check this. Create account. Okay, I'm should I receive something on my email? That's the question. Okay, I did get an email from superbase off going to just show you guys this literally just this confirm your sign up.

### 🎨 セクション 77

So we just need to click this link and uh that redirected me to this site. So with the access token. All right. So now I should do login. David.com.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Test one two three four. Enter dashboard. Oh, there we go. New dashboard. You should be redirected to search.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Okay. Authentication users. So let's check the super base if we have the user authentication. Users. There we go.

### 🌟 セクション 80

We have our user with my email. Amazing. Yuyu ID. So this worked. Let's see.

### 🎬 セクション 81

It's here. We haven't created any links or any clicks. That's good. Create a link. So we are in the dashboard.

### 📋 セクション 82

So this is the / dashboard. So this is no longer the login or the landing page. Create a link check base. So destination URL just slash U testing. I don't know.

### ⭐ セクション 83

We can I guess redirect to my YouTube channel. Just paste that in. Boom. Shorten it. Slash testing.

### 📝 セクション 84

So source Twitter. All right. There we Okay. So, let's check the links. Let's reload this.

### 💡 セクション 85

There we go. We have this link. User ID, original URL, Slack testing, created at. Amazing. No clicks yet.

### 🔧 セクション 86

So, we can test that. Here's the link. Let's put that error not found. But did this save a click or not? No.

### 🎯 セクション 87

I think that's probably fine. I think we haven't gotten to that page yet. Oh, yeah. We haven't gotten to that redirect. That's good.

### 💭 セクション 88

So this is good error. We have not built this out yet. But now we can see that links are being saved into our database. So that's very important because anytime I refresh this, it's not just stored in the browser right in local host or in the cookies is actually saved on superbase. So we could you know if you have real users you need to make sure that whatever links and you know tracking they create it doesn't get lost.

### 📌 セクション 89

So that's important. And the authentication also works. We have the user saved. So now I can login with my email and that password and it will work. So the next step should be probably the versel redeploy.

### ✅ セクション 90

Is it still running into errors? Let me check this locally. So I'm going to kill this. I'm going to clear npm run build to see what build errors we're running into. Superbase URL is required.

### 📚 セクション 91

Okay. So we need the environment files. Just copy everything. Well, yeah, it's kind of simple. We should add it here.

### 🔖 セクション 92

This I mean we're going to use a single one. So, I'm just going to copy this from the env file. Boom. Boom. Make sure we copy the whole thing.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Add more. That's the reason it's failing because we have reimplemented superbase. So, it it really needs it. So, deploy here. It doesn't fail.

### 🚀 セクション 94

So, now it shouldn't fail. So, because in the dev it's like more lenient. Next chest is more re lenient than in the production build. That's why it wasn't failing. And also because we actually had ENV file but we didn't have it here on VCEL.

### ⚡ セクション 95

So that's the next step. Get that running and then we can get a public URL. I can even send it for you guys in chat so you can test it. Let's see. All right.

### 🌟 セクション 96

So it didn't crash on the same thing. That's good. That's good. Congratulations. Just deployed a new project.

### 🎬 セクション 97

All right. Uh we don't have a custom domain but will give us a default domain. H. So, I'm going to screenshot this. Go back to our advisor.

### 📋 セクション 98

Boom. Paste it in. Read master plan again. I just successfully deployed on Versel. Tell me how to test that it is publicly accessible.

### ⭐ セクション 99

Answer in short. But overall, we should get a free URL here. deployment here. There's the domain. Yeah, here's our domain.

### 📝 セクション 100

And let's see if I can log in here. I'm going to disable my ad blocker extensions and block origin. Let's see if I can log in with my same login. David.com test one, two, three, 4. Almost forgot the password.

### 💡 セクション 101

Right. Amazing. So, I was able to log in. So this is deployed and it's the same as URL because we're using the same database. So that's good.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Okay. So that's successful. Let's see what needs to be done next. We need to probably add the analytics, right? All right.

### 🎯 セクション 103

So read build idea and master plan again and tell me what is the next next step. Answer in short. If we review this plan, we haven't implemented analytics yet. tracking table display click counts per source simple chart. Yeah, we need to implement some analytics that haven't been done yet.

### 💭 セクション 104

So that should be next. So I'm going to do read master and build and execute the analytics step. Do not build anything else yet. The fewer lines of code, the better. And now we can just uh do a git commit and it should automatically redeploy.

### 📌 セクション 105

I don't know if the versel is set up to redeploy automatically. Let me check that. Boom. New proxy on Versell. When I deploy a project through GitHub, does Versel automatically redeploy it on any new commit to the main branch or do I have to set that up in the settings inside of the Vers project somehow?

### ✅ セクション 106

Browse the web answer. In short, we don't need a deep research for this. Okay, so it should be automatic. So now we have this. So we're going to do analytics face complete.

### 📚 セクション 107

Copy this. And I should probably just use the same terminal. Get add dot get add dot get commit. Boom. Get push.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Clear. Now we go GitHub. We go this on Versel. We should go to deployments. We should see a new deployment is being made.

### 🎨 セクション 109

And this is the analytics phase complete. So it should take around last time it took 27 seconds. So it should take similar time. And then we should be able to access that. We no longer need to do local host.

### 🚀 セクション 110

So we can just do in production because why not? Okay. Uh we can close that for now. Okay. 19 seconds.

### ⚡ セクション 111

So now uh no errors. So that's good. Uh I just pushed to GitHub and Versel automatically redeployed it. Tell me how to test this step by step. Answer in short.

### 🌟 セクション 112

So now we're testing everything in production. This is no longer local. Everything is deployed. And we have stuff here. Let me reload.

### 🎬 セクション 113

Maybe click on this. I don't know where this is. Add. Okay. We need a super URL.

### 📋 セクション 114

We have these public service URL redirect URL. Oh, the authentication redirect URL is not there of perance base. We did these already. Do I need to add the versel URL to my superbase redirect URLs in the AL settings? This is something we didn't do.

### ⭐ セクション 115

Remember here we only added the local host but not the versal URL. Yes. Okay. So we need to add this that way we can implement proper off site URL. Let's change that.

### 📝 セクション 116

And let's change this. Just add it. Redirect. Boom. Callbacks email.

### 💡 セクション 117

Okay. To redirect back to your life site. Versel already has the superbase envir. What is next? How do I test the actual analytics we just added on the deployed URL?

### 🔧 セクション 118

Open in incognito tab. Okay, so that's we should test that. We have this link. Let's open incognito tab. Paste that in.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Not found. Still not found. Maybe let's screenshot this. Seems like the redirect feature is still not working. Read master plan again and check the code again.

### 💭 セクション 120

Say do not be lazy. Actually read all of the files in full and tell me whether the redirect has been implemented fully and properly or not. Think harder. Answer in short. Wait, I sent that on accident.

### 📌 セクション 121

Okay, I need to copy this. Escape it. Boom. Do up. Paste it here.

### ✅ セクション 122

Send it all together. Okay. I'm not sure if I included a screenshot or not. Wait. Yeah, the screenshot gets deleted.

### 📚 セクション 123

That's unlucky. So, that's one cloth code feature they haven't added yet. If you go back to previous messages, any attached screenshots don't get sent with them. So, let's send this. sees authentication done just uh update him boom from from the beginning I haven't reset these two cloud core instances I'm using the same ones but the reason I tag the build idea and the master plan is because uh sometimes they just kind of get distracted with new context so it's just to remind them of what I'm what we're building and you know ask them what stage we're at cloud code says it found the issue code is correct but rless blocks public reads links table only allows okay so fix our policy around this So just SQL.

### 🔖 セクション 124

Okay, let's copy that. We need to wrap up in the next 5 to 10 minutes. Miy, just remind me. Back to superbase SQL editor. Boom.

### 🎨 セクション 125

New slack. Let's create this. All right, I'll drop this. Place a new one. So now let's test it.

### 🚀 セクション 126

Let's go back to our app link track. Let's copy this. Redirect. Okay, it works. It redirected me to YouTube channel.

### ⚡ セクション 127

Amazing. So now it works now. Do we have any clicks tracked? We have the click tracked. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 128

URL source t link ID time stamp check the public is going to be okay. Luckily there's no IP address here. I was scared it's going to dox me here. All right. Luckily we're not tracking that much.

### 🎬 セクション 129

That's good. Um links. Okay. Now it works. It now works.

### 📋 セクション 130

I can see it in the uh clicks table on superbase. All right, that's good. That's major step in the right direction. Now we need to see the analytics. Do we see some analytics here, right?

### ⭐ セクション 131

Twitter. That's nice. We have the graph here. Maybe we can check uh different SRC. We just copy this, but we change it to like, you know, um, YouTube or like basically the traffic source could be like SEO, you know.

### 📝 セクション 132

Let's try this. It will redirect to the same site obviously because that's how it's set up. But we should see boom, now SEO. But if we, you know, do it again or like actually we can we should be able to see like if I copy this and then go to Twitter again, we should see that we get attribution. See now Twitter is all right.

### 💡 セクション 133

So we don't have like any crazy charts yet but it works. So let's see what is raining. Okay. So I think we're we have the core features done. We have authentication.

### 🔧 セクション 134

Okay. Is the full authentication done though? That's the question. Uh is the authentication fully and properly set up inside of Superbase inside of our project. Do not be lazy.

### 🎯 セクション 135

Read all of the files again. Think harder. answer in short because we did have the email enabled and we did add the redirect URLs but I just want to make sure that is the off pages check if these pages are already set up correctly or not if not tell me what is missing answer in short this is the disadvantage of like having two clostes sometimes they don't have the same context so you need to kind of just tell them to read the code because that is the source of truth do you have anything that we haven't deployed yet Oh, but I like this uh UI style that Gemini chose. It's really appropriate for this idea. Mostly correct for Mos limitations confirmation is actually logged in yet.

### 💭 セクション 136

This is not really a big problem. Basic client session may not persist properly. That's okay for MVP. No off state session expires. Confirm email.

### 📌 セクション 137

Why would the confident email be an issue? I think it's a good step that prevents bots and spam. Answer in short. Okay. Probably disagreeing here with cloud code or if set up correctly ready to test.

### ✅ セクション 138

Okay. No, I'm testing everything in production on the vers URL. I need you to read both the master plan MD and the build idea MD. Read both of the markdown files in full and tell me whether we've implemented everything or whether something else is missing. I think the core is done.

### 📚 セクション 139

It's good for security after sign up the code immediately start dashboard. Okay. So that would be changing. All right. So what do you propose?

### 🔖 セクション 140

You propose changing it to redirect to a different page to the landing page as well or to the login page login. And where exactly do we need to change this? Answer in short. Okay. So it's checking everything to I don't know Versel is Versail.

### 🎨 セクション 141

That's crazy. post to sign up red login change. Okay. Yes. Change this.

### 🚀 セクション 142

Very simple change. It makes sense, right? After people verify their email, they should go to /lo because they're not logged in. If they go to slash data dashboard, it'll just throw an error or redirect them back to um to the homepage just extra friction. Then we're adding some parameters here into page tsx.

### ⚡ セクション 143

I don't know what that's going to change. Let's see. It just add a different text. Check out emotes. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 144

So it just adds this for easier. Yeah, that's good for easy onboarding. So let's push this. I'm going to say get add dot getit commit changed uh redirect after email confirm. Hit push.

### 🎬 セクション 145

There we go. Now we're going to have a new versal deployment here. That's going to be fixed. What is going on here? Hey, Clco is doing a deep check that everything is set up correctly and try harding here.

### 📋 セクション 146

Push to deploy. That's good. We have an error here. So, let's check it locally. npm run build.

### ⭐ セクション 147

Let's check this error. Copy it. It's the same here. So, I'm going to copy everything. Say logs.

### 📝 セクション 148

Paste it in. logs. We're getting an error. Think harder. What's causing it?

### 💡 セクション 149

Implement a clean and minimal fix. Answer in short. It's probably something obvious. It changed the login. Let's read it.

### 🔧 セクション 150

Read more. Encounter error login page. SLO exiting the build. Everything's implemented. You're ready for demo phase.

### 🎯 セクション 151

We already did all that. Okay. I should have pasted it into this cloud code actually. Let's let's check again. Clear app arrow.

### 💭 セクション 152

If you do app arrow in the terminal, you can get to the previous commands. So let's save time. All right, it's good. So get get add.get commit fixed build error. I don't think it's needed to elaborate the comment message further on on these simple fixes.

### 📌 セクション 153

Another push. So now let's hope that versel goes through and we're going to have the full app finished with superbase database with authentication setup with link attribution and with a nice you know bar graph showing how the split of traffic is coming in and we can obviously create multiple I can create like one for my Twitter destination URL and we can do the slack slash you know Twitter shorten it boom and we can track the traffic to this slug and see how we goes and if you wanted more detail analytics we could obviously add some charts and graphs but for MVP this is good enough and we have it deployed so you know you can send it to potential clients you can send it to your friends family and get users testing it let's see if they find errors that's much more important than trying to overperfect and you know a lot of people like take months before they get to the deployed app and you can see we did this here in a matter of like 60 minutes fully deployed public app with authentication working that you can safely send to hundreds of people So it's deployed and yeah now if anybody signs up they go to the landing page. So to check your latest cloud update you need to do global terminal pseudo cloud update. Type in your password. Do not reveal this obviously.

### ✅ セクション 154

Okay. So I have the latest version. So let's check it because I don't want to be speaking uh untrue things you know. So boom search tell me what are the main changes in the last 10 cloth code versions since boom answer in short actually we can do deep research why not lsp support clickable image links that's good okay also the images when you paste in an image it's like uh if I take a screenshot of this for example and you paste it in it's much better UI before it was kind of annoying now you can do this and you can click this very nice quality of uh my braes enter key for pro suggestions more MCP stuff 3x memory improvement I mean they're making a lot of changes it it just feels better that that would be the main thing I would summarize it feels more optimized and easier to use I don't know what's happening okay we have the image what is next in short do not do anything else all right let's check the UI So you can see UI has improved. Let's go back maybe.

### 📚 セクション 155

There we go. I'm going to say but this looks like every other vibe coded app. Give it some personality. Choose some specific design style that's not that popular nowadays but that still looks very professional and very clean. Okay, let's see.

### 🔖 セクション 156

So superbase is created. Here we have the other cloud code advisor. For the link, you need a publishable key and project URL. So, first let's do we have the env? No, we don't.

### 🎨 セクション 157

So, I'm going to create the env file. New file env. Boom. So, first we need the publishable key, the anon key. So, let's get that.

### 🚀 セクション 158

It's right here. So, we're going to copy that. Boom. Boom. What's next?

### ⚡ セクション 159

Project URL. Let's see where we can find that. Project ID. Finding general settings. General is this it?

### 🌟 セクション 160

Let's ask is this the project URL? See, you shouldn't have like any shame in double checking because that's how you prevent lots of errors. Not exactly pres. All right. So, we have it.

### 🎬 セクション 161

All right. I'm going to paste that in. Boom. Optional for side I mean secret key for now. All right.

### 📋 セクション 162

We don't need a secret key now for now. So now let's go back to the developer. I say now revert all the changes you made because I already set up the env file. Right. So I created the env file inside of the root um f root structure of our project.

### ⭐ セクション 163

So now I did set up the super bit project. So there's no need for local anymore. So revert the changes where you remove superbase and add it back. take a deep breath and proceed like a senior developer would. All right, because right now we removed everything.

### 📝 セクション 164

So that Okay, some errors. Interesting. So I'm going to screenshot. Boom. Paste this in.

### 💡 セクション 165

We're running into some errors. Analyze what this is and implement a clean and minimal fix. So I'm adding the screenshot as context. So I'm using the cursor agent with Gemini 3 Pro to kind of redesign our front end. Now the developer clot code is going over and reimplementing superbase.

### 🔧 セクション 166

So we should actually probably do another commit. Get at dot. Boom. Just stage everything. Get commit front end redesign.

### 🎯 セクション 167

Get push. So we have some uh we we need to do more commits. I should have done more. I mean in the past I used to delegate this to AI but this is just not needed. It's just faster to do it yourself.

### 💭 セクション 168

And here you can see like which files have been changed that are not staged yet. We can see. All right, look at this. This looks much more unique. I like this UI.

### 📌 セクション 169

I like this design. Okay, that's good. So now this is being reimplemented. Also, I'm going to create another file which is the another dogs another I'm going to do master plan. This just overview of everything we need to do.

### ✅ セクション 170

I'm going to have the advisor read it now. Read master plan. There we go. and help me execute the superbase table creation. Also, I should I should remind you to read the other file again and read build idea again.

### 📚 セクション 171

Table creation tell me exactly what to do and why answer in short. All right, so we can probably close the left sidebar because the front end redesign is done. So, we don't need Gemini for now. We can pause it. Let's see if this is done.

### 🔖 セクション 172

Reverted to superb base. So, I'm just going to copy this. I'm going to use that as my get commit message that we have reimplemented superbase. Boom. Get push.

### 🎨 セクション 173

So if in case anything goes wrong, you just revert to last commit. It's that's why it's very important to do comets frequently like every 10 15 minutes. All right. So based on the specs, you need two tables. Users base of automatically superbase SQL editor and new query.

### 🚀 セクション 174

So right it's given us exactly what we need to do. So on the left SQL editor, let me zoom in so it's easier to see for you guys. And we need to run this SQL query links table clicks table. So this really depends on the build idea, right? Which tables you need.

### ⚡ セクション 175

And superbase is posgress. So it's very classic text tag, nothing experimental. Let's run this. We we don't have to worry because it's a new project, right? Normally if you run SQL queries, you should be very careful what you run.

### 🌟 セクション 176

But u this is a new project. So there's no no harm. And we can see clicks tables right here. Links tables right here. Let's see the columns.

### 🎬 セクション 177

ID, link ID, source tag, time stamp, country, and refer links ID, user ID, original URL, slug, and created out. So, pretty millime stick. We don't want to bloat the project. We want to keep it simple. Uh, done.

### 📋 セクション 178

Links are created. And then I'm going to do a good practice. Give me a simple SQL query that will just double check that everything was created successfully. And then I'll copy over the result and give it to you. Answer in short.

### ⭐ セクション 179

So you want to double check that because cloud code can see our all our files right but it cannot see superbase. Now obviously there is a superbase uh MCB server but I would definitely not recommend AI agents giving a database access maybe with the dev database but it's tricky because you know then you're one step away from changing it to the pro database. Yeah, that's one thing where you shouldn't where you should be copy pasting and you should have one layer of protection not giving superbase access to the coding agents because you know if you have a production database they can just wipe the table delete the table do a lot of harm. So for stuff like this it's just better to do it manually and ask the AI for in for um instructions. So let's copy this SQL query.

### 📝 セクション 180

This is just to double check. So let's go back on the left SQL editor. Boom. New snippet. Let's run this.

### 💡 セクション 181

I'm going to export copy as uh markdown. I'm going to do result just a XML tag. Boom. Paste in the result. And this this is just a pro engineering tip for it makes it easier for the agents to see what you're talking about.

### 🔧 セクション 182

Here is the result. Tell me if this is good or not. Answer in short. It looks good. We have the two tables and we have the columns and data types and it should be actually documented in here.

### 🎯 セクション 183

So yeah, this is what we copied. is the schema SQL. All good. Okay. Does it align with schema SQL perfectly?

### 💭 セクション 184

Answer in short. A triple check. Never heard nobody. Let's see what's here. Revert to superbase.

### 📌 セクション 185

Okay. Next step is authentication. Read master plan and help me implement the off step. tell me exactly what I need to do and why. So we have the front end running right we have it here but we need to implement authentication through superbase otherwise it wouldn't be secure actually I'm going to interrupt it and I'm going to do arrow up and I'm going to edit it and string short I forgot that magical important prompt not perfectly two differences column name click that okay so I'm going to say update the SQL file so it matches what I actually it in superbase.

### ✅ セクション 186

Do not change anything else. That's easier than changing superbase. How is close code doing the session? Good. Send some feedback to enthropic because already done.

### 📚 セクション 187

You need to configure superbase. So authentication providers ensure email is enabled. So let's do that. Superbase authentication. Uh where's the providers?

### 🔖 セクション 188

It's like on the left. I think email notification. Oh, here signin providers. It's a bit hidden. We need to find the email.

### 🎨 セクション 189

There it is. It's enabled. That's good. Authentication URL configuration set. All right.

### 🚀 セクション 190

So, URL configuration. Even though I've used Superbase for a long time and I've been in this UI for many, many hours, I can still get confused. So, again, no shame asking AI to guide you. So, site URL. Okay, we need to allow local host so we can do stuff testing.

### ⚡ セクション 191

So, it is here. That's here. Redirect URL. So, we just need to add this wild card URL. Boom.

### 🌟 セクション 192

Save. That's the flow. Okay. So, I'm going to screenshot this. Copy.

### 🎬 セクション 193

Paste. Doublech check the attached file to ensure all is good. Answer in short. Boom. Okay.

### 📋 セクション 194

So, this is like updated. So, I'm going to do another get push. Get add dot get commit created superbase uh base tables. hit push. I mean realistically we haven't done these changes inside of our project, right?

### ⭐ セクション 195

It's done inside superbase. But we changed the SQL file. This is just for docs. This is doesn't do anything. So this is just for documentation so that we have the schema documented here.

### 📝 セクション 196

Otherwise, anybody working on the project wouldn't know how the subase is set up and that would be very complicated. So this is just to make stuff easier in the future. Your config looks good. Issue is missing. get click stat function dashboard uses I say like uh change the code to actually follow the new schema again it's easier to change the code then make change superb base do not the fewer lines of code changed the better in AI it's all about what you're building and what business model you choose a lot of people choose a business model that's becoming obsolete that's saturated that's highly competitive that requires just a high starter budget that doesn't give them enough time freedom.

### 💡 セクション 197

So choosing the right business model is the single biggest decision that's going to impact whether you're successful in AI or not. And actually, we made a whole video on that which I'm going to link to here. If you want to start your own air business, watch this video
