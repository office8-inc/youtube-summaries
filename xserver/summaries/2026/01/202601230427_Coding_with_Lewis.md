## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Excel is a programming language. Seriously, Excel is turning complete, meaning it can theoretically compute anything a regular programming language can. Keyword is theoretically. Inkbox built a working CPU inside of Excel with a 16-bit architecture without using VBA scripts and open sourced it. There's also people who've made Doom run in Excel, full 3D rendering in cells.

### 📋 背景・概要

A lot of the time it's being done programmatically via Python or VBA, but it's possible to do a 3D rendering system without those scripts which Sebell has shown us. Microsoft then added a lambda function which lets you write reusable functions in your sheet opening the floodgates essentially. And technically speaking, Excel has been turn complete for decades. We just kept underestimating it. Apart from those who push it to its limits, everyone's worried about AI taking over developer jobs.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Well, the Excel people, they're doing it first. Fall for more.
