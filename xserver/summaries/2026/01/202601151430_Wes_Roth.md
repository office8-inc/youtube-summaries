## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Well, it's 2026 and the hits keep coming. We had a nice little break and it's now back to sliding into the singularity and today Elon is on a war path. There's a lot of things going on with Elon XAI, his lawsuit with OpenAI. Also, there's a new partnership with the Department of War. It's now called the Department of War.

### 📋 背景・概要

But we'll come back to all of that. Let's start with this breaking news. So, this is, and I apologize if I mispronounced it, Pata Ivani. I'm sure I pronounced that wrong but he's a researcher at UCI Irvine California and he had early internal beta version of Grock 4.20. So this gentleman is a professor of mathematics at UCI former posttock at Princeton exploring what AI can and can't do in math.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So he's saying that it gro 4.2 20 it found a new bellman function for one of the problems that he's been working with his student and alpe after which he proceeds to write out a lot of words some of which you might know before we go into this let me kind of just quickly give you a very simplified version of of what they're talking about here so imagine you have cliffs like this right so you can kind of run around here but if you go over the edge you fall to your doom so you can sort of stay anywhere here but if you go over the edge you're dead so the these are the cliffs This is kind of the edge of the cliff. Right now, imagine we unleash some sort of a wild crazed animal here and it will run around randomly. So, you sort of know how fast it moves, but you have no idea where it's going to move. All right? So, it might run off the cliff or it might run off in the other direction.

### 📝 詳細説明

Your goal is to prove that no matter what random steps it takes, it will never crash. It will never go off the cliff. Now, you could assimilate an infinite number of paths. basically every possible random path this thing could take. And so humans usually kind of use intuition.

### 💡 実例・デモ

They just kind of guesstimate. They they estimate. So sort of like as long as we sort of keep in this range, we should be safe, right? So I'm 99% sure that if we stay in this range, we're going to be safe. It's not going to crash.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It's not going to fly off the cliff. So if I understand what he's saying correctly, that's kind of what they did here. So they kind of create this formula with this safe zone where they're they're pretty sure. But after 5 minutes of working, Grock 420 produced an explicit formula which they talk about here. But the point is this.

### 🎯 応用例

He's saying that this gives a sharp lower bound. Sharp lower bound here. What that means is that Grock was basically able to draw a line that's very close to the actual cliff. Right? So while human mathematicians, they sort of have this like safety zone just to make sure everything's fine.

### 💭 考察

Right? So they kind of draw the line here far away kind of just to make extra certain because we don't know where it is. So we kind of draw it here where we're pretty sure it's right. Rock drew a sharp bound meaning very very close to the actual cliff. And here towards the bottom he also says so previously the best known lower bound was this.

### 📌 まとめ

Then their paper they produced they obtained this and this gro crocs bellman function is actually sharp. So, if you didn't like my deranged pig and the cliffs of the do example, you can imagine a mountain and the first researcher slowly climbed up the mountain, got to this point and said, "Well, we know that this mountain is at least 2,000 ft." Then they slowly climbed up the mountain. They said, "Well, actually, it's at least 3,000 ft." Right? So, they slowly climb up it and they they're able to say how based on how far they got was that's at least this high cuz we got there. So, here's what Grock 4.2 did.

### ✅ 結論

it magically teleported. It just appeared. It teleported to the top of the mountain and said, "No, actually it's it's 4,000 ft." So, instead of painstaking process of crawling up the mountain and saying, "Well, it's at least this high and or no, it's at least this high." It it doesn't do this. It just appears at the top and tells you what the number is. So, the question is, how did Grock do it?

### 📚 追加情報

And the answer is, of course, uh right here. You can see it plainly for yourself. I'm sure it's completely obvious to to all of us. I'm I'm totally kidding. Very few people in the world probably truly understand what happened here, but the one thing that's jumping out at me is that this isn't a a blackbox solution.

### 🔖 補足

So, while neural nets were often criticized as being kind of this black box neural networks, we shove some data in one end and then it spits out answers in the other, but we have no idea how it got those answers. So, it's kind of a scary black box. Well, this discovery is kind of a a glass box, if you will, because Grock 420 came up with a a formula. We humans can now inspect this. Well, not all of us, but some of us, you know, that know what the heck this is, can inspect it, figure it out, understand why it works.

### 🎨 セクション 13

They can write a paper about it, contributing further to your understanding of the subject. So as the professor is saying here so any significance of this result it will not tell you how to change the world tomorrow rather it gives a small step towards understanding what is going on with averages of stochastic analoges of derivatives quadratic variations of boolean functions how small can they be I think a lot of people will be thrown off by the language in fact if you scroll down to the first comment first comment goes I don't understand any of the math but this feels significant the next comment whatever you say bro the point that he's saying here. So this whole thing just pretend it says math we don't yet understand that humans have not yet been able to grasp. So he's saying it in this case croc 4.2 gives a small step towards understanding this math that we don't fully understand yet. So what does this mean?

### 🚀 セクション 14

This is a credible report. This is a very credible institution researchers. So this is a credible report that Grock 420 is capable of automated theorem discovery. And if you've been following the stories, Grock 4.2 isn't the first one, but it's very much kind of near the front of the best foundation models in the world that recently have been kind of, you could say, acquiring these abilities. So, this is Terrence Tao, considered by many to be the most gifted, the number one mathematician in the world.

### ⚡ セクション 15

A few days ago, he posted this on I thought it said Masttodon. It's mathadon. math stadon. So he's saying recently the application of AI tools passed a milestone specifically this is for what they callish problems a thousand plus problems that are very unique interesting challenging they're sort of handpicked to be well unique interesting challenging etc. So he's saying recently AI more or less autonomously solved one of these airish problems.

### 🌟 セクション 16

They did it in the bright manner like how how you're supposed to in the spirit of the problem with the result they gave not replicated in existing literature since he posted this. There's been multiple other ones that have been solved. So this is Neil Smani. I think last time I said that he he is a quantitative researcher at Citadel. I guess he says previously previously he was so I apologize for the mixup.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So currently he's doing formal methods and a mechanistic interpretability. So he's in machine learning AI AI safety. So over the weekend he picked up GPT 5.2 pro and submitted another sort of solution that's generated by this AI system for one of the airish problems number 397 in particular and there's a number of other ones. So what this means is that we very very recently sometime within the last few months crossed a very important threshold. So I think it's referred to or we can use this term automated theorem discovery.

### 📋 セクション 18

Right? So this AI discovering theorems on its own. So Tao is saying that it was more or less autonomously. So there was some feedback from an initial attempt from professor Ivana Cilli. I do believe he's saying that you know as he's stating it sounds like it was autonomous right so it found a new bellman function and certainly that's what it seems like it's happening here right so they gave it to this it thought for 5 minutes 15 seconds and then boom so if this was kind of a before automated ethereum discovery and this is after right so GPT 5.2 two is right now making a lot of noise because it there's a number of things that seem to indicate that it it crossed that threshold and again this is not like a a real thing but what I'm saying is in the past we didn't have any examples like this and now we have examples like this also I believe alpha evolve from Google deep mind had something and I saw it announced I haven't had a chance to look at it yet but that is also kind of a a whole system so it's large language model with scaffolding and tons of other things kind of built around it so it's like a whole AI system.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Whereas it sounds like GPT 5.2 just the chatbot is solving these issues. Rock 420 seems like it's just the chatbot by itself that's that's solving these things. And now just you know not that long. So all this happened over the course of the last few months what we're talking about of GPT 5.2 that was the last less than two weeks. And now boom we have a Grock Grock 4.20 just comes charging in.

### 📝 セクション 20

It's not blurry eyed. It's not sleepy. There's a a whole different energy and there's probably a lot of other examples. In fact, Terrence Tao has a whole list of different things that AI has been able to accomplish kind of like what proof was able to write or improve etc etc etc. So this is Huan May.

### 💡 セクション 21

So he's ex Google deep mind now building EGI at XAI. He's saying to understand the universe we've doubled down on pushing Grock's mathematical reasoning. It's deeply rewarding to see that progress making a real impact recognized by the math community. Also, it looks like the team at XEI is offering early access sounds like to Grog 420 for scientific discovery. If you want to use it for scientific discovery, sounds like they might get you a pass.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Mr. Elon Musk is saying that Neurolink is isn't required for digital super intelligence because AI is going to get there first without brain implants. the point of neural link that's real values boosting our own bandwidth since our daily output is incredibly limited compared to machines and certainly if you think about it we're very rate limited so to speak based on how we communicate whether that's through words or sign language or or typing or whatever we we tend to think a lot faster than we can communicate those thoughts it would be great to be able to kind of communicate with AI at the speed of thought sometimes I write something into Gemini Chadigu or or Grock and like it has a ton of spelling errors, right? Some of the words don't look right and just like the thought is kind of barely completed because I had a thought and just kind of mashed the keyboard and I hit enter and most of the time nowadays they they get it. Like if you showed me a week later what I wrote, I would not be able to understand what I wrote.

### 🎯 セクション 23

But these AI models, they're like, "Oh yeah, that's crystal clear. I know exactly what you mean. Let me explain it for you." In other news, it looks like Elon's case against Open AI is going to trial. Kalashi is taking a bets on who's going to win. So, looks like it opened at under 30% chance that Elon's going to win.

### 💭 セクション 24

Quickly went to 31, then 36. Now, it's up to 41%. Elon Musk retweeted saying, "I've lost a few battles over the years, but I've never lost a war." Looks like since then, the thing went up to 60%. So people are betting that Elon is going to win his case against OpenAI potentially. If I understand correctly, is it possible they're going to reverse their ability to to go to a forprofit model?

### 📌 セクション 25

This would mean that they would not have the ability to do their IPO to go public on the stock market. The thing is Elon Musk did bankroll open AAI before they had a lot of the funding. He was like one of the first money in I believe. But since it was a nonprofit, then that means that was kind of like a donation, right? With no strings attached.

### ✅ セクション 26

But if now open grows to whatever size it is now, looks like $750 billion, right? I wonder if it's possible that Elon Musk is going to get a stake in the company as they go IPO. Would that be entertaining? Are you not entertained? Because if it is entertaining, then it's the most likely outcome.

### 📚 セクション 27

I believe that's referred to as the Musk's razor. I'm not even kidding. That's an actual thing. Musk's razor, right? It's saying that the most ironic or entertaining outcome is often the most probable.

### 🔖 セクション 28

If you recall, there was some time a while back where Elon did get emotional during the interview, describing how difficult it was to hear his heroes, the people that he kind of looked up to, criticizing him and what he's doing with Space X, etc. Interstelling this email exchange surfaced somewhere. So Sam Alman emailing Elon Musk saying, "I remember seeing you in a TV interview a long time ago, maybe 60 minutes. Were you being attacked by some guys and they were heroes of yours and it was really tough." Well, you're my hero and that's what it feels like when you attack open. totally get we have screwed some stuff up, but we have worked incredibly hard to do the right thing.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And I think we have ensured that neither Google nor anyone else is on a path to have unilateral control over AGI, which I believe we both think is critical. I am tremendously thankful for everything you've done to help. I don't think OpenAI would have happened without you, and it really freaking hurts when you publicly attack Open AI. So Elon replies saying, "I hear you and it's certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake." So definitely our sort of progress towards AGI is one of the areas where I would feel a lot safer. I would definitely prefer it if there was no no strife, no drama as the kids put it.

### 🚀 セクション 30

But it does look like a lot of these interests, they're on a collision course and um it's it's gonna get wild. Let me know in the comments where you think this will end. Do you think Elon will ripple Open AI, prevent them from getting IPOed, from from getting funding, or do you think this lawsuit will fall flat? Or do you think it's possible he's going to get a stake in OpenAI or get some control over OpenAI? Let me know what you think and what you wish would happen.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And finally, we have this. So, I remember seeing some posts about this December 22nd, 2025. So XAI is having a partnership with the Department of War. So here in the States, if you're not familiar, we're we're figuring out what we want to call this thing. It used to be called the War Department back before 1947.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Then we renamed it the Department of Defense. And now we're back to the Department of War. So this is yet another thing that maybe possibly could be seen as a rivalry. So if you recall that project Stargate that was announced, it was half a trillion dollars. It was $500 billion.

### 🎬 セクション 33

A joint venture between OpenAI, Soft Bank, and Oracle. And that was to build out the infrastructure. Musk publicly kind of bashed Stargate saying they don't have the funding. It's not going to go anywhere. Meanwhile, it looks like XEI and Elon Musk, they're locking down the kind of the national security apparatus, potentially the most stable customer on the planet.

### 📋 セクション 34

The interesting thing is, as you might know, in the US, a lot of these different departments in the government, they all kind of have their little data silos that they kind of keep hidden from everybody else. There's some opakqueness. There's not a lot of transparency there. It seems like there's some political will now to reverse that. So there's some decrees to break down that data siloing.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So it's very possible that a foundation model, if you have access to that data for for training, for fine-tuning purposes, that could certainly be a gold mine. And finally, we have a new Grock model being tested in the LM arena. It's called Slateflow. Apparently, there's also another one called Tide Wisp. Now, those are of course rumors.

### 📝 セクション 36

take it with a great grain of salt, but you know, I mean, they tend to be pretty accurate when we see something on LM Arena. Often times it does translate into the release of those models, you know, usually several weeks later. We don't always get it right which model is. Sometimes we think it's going to be one model, it's, you know, by OpenAI, but it's like some other different model that people didn't expect. So, I tested that out.

### 💡 セクション 37

Looks like I was able to get a slate flow. It returned Python code that worked very decent, very fast. I'm going to try to test it with some more difficult prompts because this wasn't uh wasn't testing it to its full sort of capabilities. But whatever the case is, it looks like Elon Musk is gearing up for war. You know, figuratively, but but also kind of literally working with the Department of War.

### 🔧 セクション 38

He's talked in the past about his concerns because in a lot of critical military infrastructure that we need, namely drones, we are heavily reliant on Chinese technology or I should say US is relying on Chinese technology. There's not that much of a manufacturing capability here for drones compared to you know DJI owns most of the market. So, it's estimated that that one drone company owns 70 to over 90% in consumer and commercial sectors. And of course, when you're interacting with Grock, you do notice that it it's kind of built differently than a lot of the other models. There's less social filters, the situations with the other models where it seems like they're not sure which sort of a political side to take.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Grock has always presented itself kind of a cemented status as this kind of like nononsense unhinged follow the truth. And so one of the key reasons that the administration cited using Grock, the reason they gave why they wanted to use Grock is because it has a lack of what they called ideological constraints. So, they want something that will adhere to lawful military action rather than social safety filters. Which, to be fair, some of these filters can be problematic with a lot of these models because they'll refuse to answer some fairly basic questions because they see some ethical conflict there that doesn't really exist. So, it' be kind of interesting to see how far advanced Elon thought this through.

### 💭 セクション 40

Was this in some part positioned to be able to to be put in this particular situation where it now interacts with all the employees for the Department of War? Potentially making some decisions on the battlefield or or if not decisions, then at least kind of like simulating through all the possible outcomes and presenting the decision makers of kind of here's what the chances of this conflict going in these particular ways. and then the generals or whoever is making the decisions will be able to kind of take those reports and make their human decisions based on those reports. All right, so that's it for me. I feel like the next few weeks are going to be huge.

### 📌 セクション 41

It seems like just the news are dropping every single day. So stay frosty as they say. If you made it this far, thank you so much for watching. My name is Wes Roth and I'll see you in the next
