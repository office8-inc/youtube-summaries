### 🎬 導入

Here are five open source projects that I found interesting this week. FuzzyFinder or FCF is a fuzzy finder for the command line. You pipe any list into it like files, command history, whatever, and get a fast filter with fuzzy matching. This is basically a mustave if you're in the CLI or using something like Neo Vim. PG vector is a vector similarity search for Postgress.

### 📋 背景・概要

Finding things similar that isn't a keyword search is tough. So you create a mathematical version of your data then can compare it based on similarity and it's all in Postgress. The goat plane is an open source Jira linear asauna whatever alternative. These softwares can be really pricey but this is open source and under a permissive license so you can deploy it anywhere. Warp by NVIDIA is a Python framework for creating simulations and graphics code.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Usually this requires coding in a lower level language like CUDA, but this makes it fairly easy and the results are pretty impressive. Text user interfaces, they're so hot right now. So awesome. Tuies gives a comprehensive list of TUI applications as well as a way you can build your own text user interface for whatever app you want to build. What have you found this week that piqu your interest?
