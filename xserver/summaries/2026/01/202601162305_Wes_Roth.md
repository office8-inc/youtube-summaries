## 💡 概要

Anthropicがわずか10日間でClaude Coworkを開発・リリースし、AI業界に衝撃を与えました。Claude Codeが開発者向けだったのに対し、Coworkは誰でも使えるオフィス業務自動化ツールとして登場し、技術者でなくても領収書整理、ファイル管理、プレゼンテーション作成などを数分で完了できるようになりました。Claude Codeのコードの大部分がClaude Code自身によって書かれているという事実は、AIの再帰的自己改善の始まりを示唆しています。この10日間スプリントは、従来の6ヶ月の開発サイクルとは対照的で、AI時代のビジネススピードの新基準を示しています。Elon MuskもGrok 4.2がClaude Codeを超えるのは難しいと認めるほど、Anthropicの成果は際立っています。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **10日間の奇跡的開発**: Claude Codeのユーザーが非コーディング作業（休暇リサーチ、プレゼン作成、メール整理など）に使用していることに気づき、わずか10日でCoworkをリリース。従来の6ヶ月開発サイクルとは比較にならないスピード
- **AI自身がAIを改善**: Claude Codeのコードの大部分がClaude Code自身によって書かれており、これは再帰的自己改善の初期段階を示す。Lee RobinsonはGPT-5.2エージェントを使って1週間で300万行以上のコードからなるブラウザを構築
- **認知的負荷の完全オフロード**: プロジェクト全体をAIに委託し、完成品を受け取るという新しい働き方が可能に。開発者は複数のClaude Codeインスタンスを同時に動かし、それぞれ異なるプロジェクトに取り組ませている
- **自動化の崖（Automation Cliff）**: 0%から99%の自動化では効果は限定的だが、100%に達した瞬間、24時間365日稼働する完全自動化システムが誕生し、生産性が爆発的に向上
- **競争優位性の確立**: Elon MuskがGrok 4.2でもClaude Codeを超えるのは難しいと認めるほど、Anthropicは少ない予算で圧倒的な成果を達成。早期採用者と遅れる者の格差が急速に拡大している

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

All right, so we got to talk about Anthropic. We got to talk about Claude Code and the newest thing they released, Claude Coowork. It's important to understand that we're beginning to hear stories out of anthropic that would have been considered science fiction not that long ago. First and foremost, Claude Coowwork was shipped in 10 days. It's rapidly becoming this legendary anecdote in Silicon Valley because it's showing in actuality like in real time how everything is changing, how software is changing, how business is changing, creating products, startups, everything.

### 📋 背景・概要

So at this point you probably heard from the creator of cloud code, Boris Journey. So he was saying that at this point most of the code, most of the additions to cloud code are generated by cloud code. It's funny, somebody on Twitter mentioned like, "How's this not recursive self-improvement?" Like, "Why isn't this recursive self-improvement?" It certainly seems like it. And AI safety memes, kind of a funny account to follow. They do great reporting.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They kind of point out all the times where people sort of discount what's happening. So, it it answered sort of like sarcastically, oh, you know, to be called recursive self-improvement, it has to come from the recursive region of France or whatever. Point being is this would have been called recursive self-improvement by by anybody if we we've heard you know 5 10 20 years ago but now we have all these asterisks and like no it's it's not. But here's why all of that is about to change. So here's what happened.

### 📝 詳細説明

If you haven't used cloud code you might not be aware of just how crazy it is of how how useful it is for building whatever software you want. So here's why. Cloud code was developed by developers for developers, right? It was made to write code. But something weird started happening.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So Boris Chryney, he noticed it. He's the creator again of Cloud Code. So he started noticing something weird. Here's what he said. Since we launched Cloud Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

conducting vacation research, creating slide presentations, organizing emails, cancelling subscriptions, retrieving wedding photos from hard drives, tracking plant growth, and controlling ovens. There's even this anecdote where somebody I guess had tons of pictures from I guess this is their wedding that they're talking about here. They're named like 1.png, 2, 3, four, five, right? and it was just like a whole collection of it or had some random name that the camera sort of randomly assigned to or not randomly but you know had a long string of numbers and digits that was what the photo was named. So they used the cloud code to go through that massive catalog of images and name them and organize them based on who was in the picture.

### 🎯 応用例

Now think about that. That would have taken hours for somebody to do depending on how many pictures were in there. There probably is some software for for doing that. If you're doing it in like Google Photos or something like that, it slowly starts over time recognizing who you are, categorizing it, but that's Google, right? There might be some other startups doing it.

### 💭 考察

This is different. This is you you open up a program and you you tell it, you just tell it, here's what I want you to do. And in fact, I think couple of days ago, we were talking about how, you know, the cloud code, it's kind of a developer interface, command line interface, might be a turnoff for a lot of people that are just not familiar in in working with that. I think that was like 4 days ago. Here's what was happening behind the scenes.

### 📌 まとめ

So 10 days after they noticed that this was being used, you know, off label, right? Not for coding, but for everything everything else, they did a 10day sprint and released Claude Co-work because obviously Cloud Code was great for coding, but it was never just about coding. It's about giving you like almost a like digital employee, an AI employee. It's about giving its agency automation, giving it the ability to finish tasks. In the last day or two, I had five different ideas for little pieces of software that I needed specifically kind of, you know, handcrafted artisal software that I needed for very specific things that that I was going to use it for.

### ✅ 結論

I opened up several terminal windows and I kind of just gave different versions of cloud code the task and it started working on it. It did most of them very well. Two of those projects that I did as I began using it, I was like, "Wo, this is like extremely powerful and will actually change how I do work." Basically what it does is it takes some video out there on the internet, whatever you give it, it downloads it, it uses a Gemini 3.0 to kind of go through it, parse it to understand what it's about, then figure out the the best parts, kind of the clips, and you can kind of tell it what sort of time range you want to do it in, like 30 seconds to 90 seconds or whatever. So, it does that. It breaks up the video into clips.

### 📚 追加情報

It writes out a little description, a title, it adds the subtitles. And in the beginning, the first time kind of cla created this, I tried it, it wasn't too good. Like the clips that it was selecting was kind of weird. They weren't that interesting. I think it was kind of missing the point of like what's interesting.

### 🔖 補足

And I realized that clock code decided to use I think one of the older models, one of the older flash models like Gemini 2.5 flash. So I to use Gemini 3.0 and immediately it changed. Now the clips that I was choosing were phenomenal. that will save me hours and hours and hours of work moving forward. And that piece of software will only get better as the AI models that are driving it get better.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And as you've probably seen, people are building absolutely incredible stuff with cloud code. And now it's available, you know, for normies, for everybody or for the time being, it's only in the desktop app on iOS, right? But it's it's coming to everybody very soon. By everybody, I mean you don't have to know how to code. You don't need to know how to use the command line interface.

### 🚀 セクション 14

you can just point it at some folder that's on your computer and it will get to work. So, I was messing around with it for the last couple days. One of the projects I gave it was basically go online, do the following research. It said, "Oh, you know what I need is actually Claude Code for Chrome." And it said, "Okay, can you install the plugin Claude for Chrome that allows it to surf the websites, look at different stuff." So, I did. And so, now Claude Co-work used Claude for Chrome.

### ⚡ セクション 15

you know, they kind of uh co-worked together, I guess, to to finish that project. And this, I think, is where everything changes for two reasons. Two kind of thresholds have been met. So, basically, the idea that now everyone can complete these little projects, not by doing themselves, but by asking an AI assistant to do it. They can take their pile of receipts and turn it into a well organized expense report.

### 🌟 セクション 16

If you have some crazy file folder with downloads or a bunch of random stuff that's in there, have cloud code go through it line by line, renaming everything however you want to, organizing everything, maybe even deleting some some stuff. Basically, intelligently organizing that thing for you. You have a bunch of notes here and there scattered about. Have it go take a look at it put together into one comprehensive report. You have a bunch of meeting minutes.

### 🎬 セクション 17

take all of them and create a beautiful PowerPoint report with multiple pages that kind of summarizes and goes over everything. Somebody at Anthropic Apparently used it to control their oven, which I don't know exactly what they mean by that, but you can imagine a lot of possibilities. Like let's say you put a little camera outside of there, have cloud code every once in a while kind of look at what's going on and maybe okay when when it's browning on top where it looks like it's cooked, you know, maybe turn it down to a lower thing, run it for 10 minutes, then turn it off. Whatever. The point is you have something that's intelligent that can automate a lot of these tasks for you.

### 📋 セクション 18

By the way, big shout out to ai toolsreview.co.uk/ins/w what is cloud coowwork. A lot of this information I'm getting from their article that they've written. I'll post a link down below. But here's why things change. Number one, we just got to the point where you can give something to an AI like entire project and they're going to come back with the completed project.

### ⭐ セクション 19

No longer do you need to learn a whole new set of skills in order to kind of babysit it along the way. Because a lot of this is about offloading cognition onto the AI, giving it cognitive tasks and offloading it out of your own brain, just handing it over and then having it do it. Think about how big of a deal that is. Because if you have to do it yourself, you're kind of expending your mental energy points, whatever that is, however many you have a day, right? There's a limited amount of like hard work that you can do every 24 hours, let's say.

### 📝 セクション 20

And some days you have more, some days you have less, but but it's a finite supply. Now, let's say you have a chatbot of old. You can offload some of it. Like it'll help or process some of it, but you're still monitoring it. You're still babysitting it.

### 💡 セクション 21

You still have to kind of like go back and forth like the the cyborg approach. This what we're seeing here is truly aic to be fair of clock code. You still have to every once in a while hit yes, continue, but those are safety measures. They're important safety measures and there are ways of turning it off if you're supposed to, you know, launch it in that dangerous without permissions mode. But the point is it will finish the task that you gave it no matter how long it runs.

### 🔧 セクション 22

But the point is it will finish the task you gave it. The entire project, it'll come back with it finished. Today I had kind of an idea for a mobile app that's uh well, I'm not going to spoil it for you. It might be my billion-dollar idea. Actually, I'm pretty sure I've talked about it before.

### 🎯 セクション 23

It's it's kind of like a to-do list, like a habit/todo app with one of those idle games built in with a whole progression system. Those tend to be pretty addicting. You kind of want to see how your little character factory or whatever it is, how it's progressing over days. Most of the progress is offline. You just come in there once in a while to tweak things.

### 💭 セクション 24

Combine that with a to-do list and that's really kind of gamifying a a to-do list and just getting stuff done. Habitica is a great example of kind of what I'm looking for, but this is this is different. Today I asked Claude Code how to build it. First, I set it to kind of plan it out. It recommended I use a React Native for the front end, back end of Python, some sort of SQL database for the database.

### 📌 セクション 25

I didn't really need to know any of it. Now, of course, if I plan to launch the app, I would probably at this point, you know, especially for cyber security, keeping everybody's data safe, etc. You probably need an engineer to go in there kind of make sure everything's good because these Vibe coded apps some of them have been hacked data lost. So you got to be careful. But I can go from zero to to one right to my first prototype get my first user etc.

### ✅ セクション 26

I can go I can do that easily. In this case I did it in one day. It created a fully functional app at least like the bare bones. At this point it's all about adding more stuff testing it and kind of iterating on it. But in terms of that idea of cognitive offload, what it's possible for me to do now is like let's say I have an app idea.

### 📚 セクション 27

I don't have to break stride on whatever it is that I was doing at that time because at the time I was playing Arc Raiders. I had an off day. Give me a break. So I'm playing Arc Raiders. Whatever.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Sue me. And then I have this idea, right? So I pop open terminal on my other monitor. I boot up Cloud Code and I asked how would you do this? And it writes out like pages and pages.

### 🎨 セクション 29

it it really thought through a lot of the different stuff and this this is how it would do it. This is the technical specs and I said okay build it make it so number one and it started cooking and I went back to my game of Arc Raiders. I don't recall how long exactly that first portion ran for but it was I mean it was it was quite a while. Then there was some issues with rendering in the browser kept getting some error messages. We troubleshooted those back and forth a couple times and now everything works.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So we're really at a time where we're able to if we have some idea or some project we're able to just hand it off to be completed. And this is why AI is going to be such a killer app in business if you will is because you know as an example anthropic completed claude co-work in 10 days. The old school ways of running business it's not going to fly anymore. very very soon. You're not going to be able to take six months to to slowly put together an idea, form a committee, have everybody vote on it, document everything.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Just like all the slow corporate processes, even in a startup sometimes they they tend to move pretty slow just because of the number of people that are involved. It's completely different. Cloud co-workers shipped in 10 days. If somebody put a gun to my head and said, "Hey, release this app in a kind of like a good enough form within the next 24 hours." I mean, I'm pretty sure I could 24 to 48 hours, I can probably put something out there that's pretty decent. Like, if I could just work that entire time for sure.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, that means that speed has been increased massively. the amount of kind of cognitive labor that is required to create things like this has dropped massively and now with claudic co-work that's available for a lot of other people for whom this might be their first interaction with agentic systems like this because if you think about at this point some portion of the population still not huge but it's some portion of the population that likely have tried one of the chatbots you know whether it's Grock Gemini Chad GBT claude Well, cloud is probably in terms of like regular users isn't the most popular out there, but boy are they dominating with this cloud code thing. Just today, Elon Musk was talking about the next iteration of Grock, Grock 4.2. And by all accounts, it's going to be pretty amazing. But here's the thing.

### 🎬 セクション 33

When somebody on X asked Elon Musk if Grock 4.0 to is going to be better than cloud code. He said probably not a leap above clot cloud code and he said anthropic really created something special. So Anthropic is really creating some incredible stuff with a much smaller budget than a lot of the other frontier labs. Now they have their partnership with Google. They're using TPUs to train the models but the way that they've been cooking has been absolutely incredible.

### 📋 セクション 34

I got to credit this idea to Dave Shapiro. I believe he called it the automation cliff. And the idea is this. Let's say you have some system of automation that you're trying to install and you start adding things into place, right? And you kind of go from 0% complete to to 100% complete.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Well, between zero and 99% complete, the effect isn't massive. But when you put that very last piece in and click, the entire thing gets automated. Well, it's in that moment where it just where the effect really gets ramped up quickly because now that it's automated, whatever the widget that you're trying to produce, it's going to start rolling off the conveyor belt one by one by one by one, 24 hours a day forever. And I think we're going to see that effect right now with claude co-work. So people are anthropic, they're saying that a lot of the employees there have multiple instances of claude code working.

### 📝 セクション 36

So they might have four each one working on a separate project. So each human employee has their AI employees three or four or five or six. Technically there's no limit. It just however however much you can kind of keep in your sort of short-term memory and remember what they're doing etc. By the way, again, at some point, either you have an AI manager managing them that that might be getting at some point or they themselves will become a lot more automated because a lot of the interactions that I have to have, they do feel like they're easily automated.

### 💡 セクション 37

They're there for safety, you know, in order to make sure that the cloud code doesn't do something naughty and, you know, delete all of your files on your computer or to protect it from prompt injections, etc. But those aren't sort of capability failures or or limits. They're just there for safety as we kind of iron out a lot of the kinks, etc. It will literally get to the point, I think, where you just type out the entire project that you want completed, and then this thing goes away for, you know, a few hours or days or weeks eventually, maybe longer, and it comes back to you with the completed project. So, Lee Robinson, who is at Cursor, he kind of strung a bunch of agents.

### 🔧 セクション 38

I believe he used GPT 5.2. So he put a lot of them together and in under a week it build a browser from scratch. So this is 3 plus million lines of code, thousands of files. It ran uninterrupted for one week. So we're moving from the era where you have to kind of pingpong with these models.

### 🎯 セクション 39

You kind of go back and forth and you're kind of using it like a tool to develop stuff and you're adding it to whatever project you're trying to build to now it finishes the project. It hands you the project folder. It's like done. This obviously is going to put a lot of pressure on Microsoft Copilot and in fact a lot of other startups and a lot of other big companies. As right now, Enthropic has Claude doing exceptional work with with spreadsheets with navigating the web with Cloud for Chrome.

### 💭 セクション 40

Cloud Code is incredible for developers and now Claude co-working how we do things on the computer. I think this is going to wake a lot of people up. the idea of this drop in replacement remote worker, it's very very close and I think that like regular people are about to start seeing that they will start experiencing that. So if you ever wanted to build something right now is a phenomenal time to do so. I think Samman said something like if you're not using one of you know OpenAI's products, if you're not using this every day, you're falling behind or you're not going to make it or something like that.

### 📌 セクション 41

This is kind of true. You got to start using AI cloud code or cloud work if you have access to it. Something I feel like there's going to be this period of time while the early adopters like just zoom to the moon while everybody else slowly catches up. And you definitely don't want to be one of the slow movers on this one. If you have an iOS device, so it's desktop, so MacBook or one of the desktops.

### ✅ セクション 42

I was a little bit confused about what they meant. So it's not an app from the app store. You actually have to go to Enthropic website to download the thing, run it, then log into your account, connect Claude for Chrome if if you want to browse the web and do stuff like that. You kind of designate a folder for Claude Co-work to work in and just give it some stuff to do. start kind of having it process some documents, put some stuff together, start getting familiarized with it because I think Cloud Code and Cloud Co-work are our first two examples of these truly engetic systems or at least they're beginning to be agentic.

### 📚 セクション 43

I I think this is kind of we're we're kind of crossing that line because we had chat bots, then we had the pro versions where go off, search the web, bring back a report, and then this is like the next step forward and it's a big one. Anyways, let me know what you think. Do you have any intuitions about what Anthropic is doing that puts it so far ahead of everybody else? Is it the sole document that they gave Claude? How is it possible that seemingly they're using 10x less resources to achieve significantly more than everyone else?

### 🔖 セクション 44

Let me know in the comments. And uh yeah, stay frosty. My name is Wes Roth and I'll see you in the next
