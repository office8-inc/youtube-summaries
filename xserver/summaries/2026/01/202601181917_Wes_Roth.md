- **双方の言い分の食い違い**: OpenAI側は「マスク氏自身が営利化を提案した」と主張し、実際の会議記録を公開。一方、マスク氏側は「完全な支配権を要求されて拒否した」との立場です
- **2026年4月に裁判開始**: この訴訟の結果は、非営利団体が営利企業に転換する際の法的先例となる可能性があり、AI業界全体に大きな影響を与えると予想されます

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, the war for the future of AI is heating up. Elon Musk is suing Samuel Altman. So, these court documents recently became public, unclassified, whatever you want to call it. And at first glance, they're looking pretty bad for OpenAI. Now, since then, Greg Brockman and Sam Alman, they came back.

### 📋 背景・概要

They kind of gave their version of events. So, let's take a look at both and see where we fall. So, if you're not familiar with what's going on, here's kind of what happened. So first of all, Musk, Alman, Brockman, and Ilia Sutskcover found the nonprofit OpenAI in December 2015. The goal was to make sure that Google, who was developing their AI technology at the time so that they don't have a monopoly on AI.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They wanted someone other than Google should develop AI and the resulting technology will be to benefit the public. Somewhere along the line, they decided to split ways. OpenAI eventually had the chat GPT moment. It grew, developed a lot of users. Elon Musk launched XAI and OpenAI did a couple things that Elon Musk didn't like amidst lots of other people in the AI community, including getting a lot of funding from Microsoft to basically giving them some control over OpenAI and switching to a forprofit company as opposed to being a nonprofit.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, there's tons more there, but that's kind of like the basic summary of what's happening. Specifically, what's interesting here are Brockman's personal files or a diary if you will. So Musk refers to these entries as a diary. So this is Greg Brockman's, one of the founders of the company. These are his private thoughts about the open AI structure.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So in September 2017, he's saying this is the only chance we have to get out from under Elon. I see the glorious leader that I would pick. We truly have a chance to make this happen financially. What will take me to 1 billion? Accepting Elon's terms nukes two things.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

our ability to choose though maybe we could overrule him and the economics. So later he's talking saying we cannot say that we are committed to the nonprofit. The true answer is we want Musk out. Can't see turning this into a forprofit without a very nasty fight and his story will correctly be that we weren't honest with him in the end about still wanting to do the forprofit just without him. So let me back up a little bit and kind of highlight this sentence and he's saying in his story.

### 🎯 応用例

So that's Elon Musk. Elon Musk's story correctly will be so he's going to tell the story and it'll be the truthful story. It's going to be that we weren't honest with him in the end about still wanting to do the forprofit just without him. So this is an interesting point to understand because later as you'll see so we'll we'll see we hear from Sam Alman and Brockman about kind of what their side of the story was. But here at that time 2017 in his personal notebook in his diary he's saying it's true that we weren't honest with him in the end and we we just wanted to do the forprofit and we wanted to do it without him.

### 💭 考察

And so after that November 6th meeting Brockman Alman informed Musk that they are committed to OpenAI's nonprofit structure. later Brockman's writing that another realization from this meeting is that it would be wrong to steal the nonprofit from him to convert to a BC corp without him. That would be pretty morally bankrupt and he's really not an idiot. Days later, Brockman further wrote under the heading our plan that it would be nice to be making the billions and explained that we've been thinking that maybe we should flip to a forprofit. So again, keep in mind that we're going to see the other side of it later.

### 📌 まとめ

So, I'm just presenting kind of what's written here. And as it's written here, wow, is it kind of bad, right? So, he's saying it would be wrong to steal the nonprofit from him. That would be pretty morally bankrupt. He's he's not an idiot, so he saying we want to steal this.

### ✅ 結論

I know it's bad, and he's not an idiot, so he's going to see it. He's going to fight it, but it would be nice to make the billions. So, therefore, yeah, we should flip this to a for-profit. So in beginning of 2018, Altman is working on a fundraising structure that does not rely on a public offering. So not doing IPO and becoming a stock.

### 📚 追加情報

Brockman is throughout the whole time leading up to that is telling Musk that we're going to try our best to remain a nonprofit. In February 2018, Musk resigns from the OpenAI board, but agreed to continue to donate and advise the organization. Musk provided just under 10 million to OpenAI over the next 3 years to pay for the Open AI office space. So at this point I believe he's in tens of millions. We we'll see the exact total number uh summed up later.

### 🔖 補足

But this is a tens of millions that he's I guess donated is the right word since a it's a notfor-profit or nonprofit structure donating this money to provide office space to recruit the needed talent. And there's also kind of the nonmonetary things that he's providing because for example it sounds like Ilia Susker maybe would not have been on board without Elon Musk. I believe Elon had some connection there that he was working on. After Musk resigned, evidence revealed that Opening I began building out its for-profit ventures and developing a relationship with Microsoft. Now of course we're seeing the massive massive buildout of the infrastructure.

### 🎨 セクション 13

You need the AI chips to train these models. So maybe that was like the only way to go. A lot of people are saying this was sort of a bad thing to do, but I don't know if there was a another choice, an alternative. You needed to be doing fund raising. I'm not saying it's wrong or right, but as you'll see in a second, this whole thing is a lot murkier than it seems.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, later they talk about kind of the new for-profit structures that they were trying to adopt. So, they had a for-profit subsidiary. This would allow us to raise capital. Investors would have a capped return. And after the forprofit entity was created, open a transferred its assets out of the nonprofit and to the forprofit, it moved substantially all of its intellectual property that was developed at the nonprofit at that point and all employees to the forprofit charity.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So if I'm following along here, and I remember looking this earlier when it was happening. So this is the nonprofit. This is what it used to be and still is I believe, right? But what they did is they created kind of a subsidiary, a a another company. And this was a holding company.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So the nonprofit owned a company underneath it, so to speak, because companies can own other companies. Sometimes you specifically form holding companies that own a basket of other companies. Not necessarily good or bad. There's some advantages to keeping things structured that way, right? So, but here we have our first kind of kind of I guess for-profit company.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And I believe they called this O AI GP LLC, right? So this was GPLC and this is where all the employees were, right? So the employees got transferred here. All the assets intellectual intellectual property was transferred here, right? So basically they took it out of nonprofit and they put it into this forprofit company OI GP LLC.

### 📋 セクション 18

Also, I think there's another company here as well. That one was created for for Microsoft. So this was OI Global LLC, whatever. And that's where Microsoft came in. So MS Microsoft, this is the portion that they kind of owned.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So here's kind of a chart. I just wanted to break it apart so we can see each piece, right? So this is the original and the employees, original investors. They're here. Then they create another one.

### 📝 セクション 20

This is the cap profit company. Microsoft owns this this OpenAI GPLC. That's that was created. it it you know it's underneath that one as well capped profit company they create the for-profit company and Microsoft is showing interest from the beginning in July 2019 Microsoft agrees to invest 1 billion OpenAI LP in exchange for a convertible limited partnership interest and writes to its profits up to 20 billion so as you can imagine starting something as a nonprofit receiving donations and then creating another company moving everything into that company and now it's a for-profit company. If that is a perfectly legal thing to do, more and more people are going to do that.

### 💡 セクション 21

It's almost like a a loophole, but for getting taxfree donations, running it as a nonprofit. Obviously, there's a lot of things wrong if that's how you can run it just by filing some new paperwork and all of a sudden you all that goodwill, donations, everything everything you've developed under that umbrella, like boom, now you're a startup and you're off to the races. Obviously there's there's issues there not even relating to open AI or AI or or tech or anything just in terms of is that how we should run these corporations because that becomes almost like a a cheat code a loophole for everybody to start their startups in in this specific fashion. I remember Elon Musk at some point on Twitter saying how is this legal he was not aware that you are able to do this that it's even possible to do something like this. So, this is kind of important to understand.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Converting a massive nonprofit into a for-profit [snorts] giant company in in the tech space, a tech giant is extremely rare. It's being described as I I shouldn't even say it's rare. I think it's the the only time this happened. And this is a live experiment that we're all seeing unfold in front of our eyes. So what I think a lot of this is going to come down to and I'm not a lawyer so please take this with a grain of salt but this kind of based on my my reading my understanding right but so they had the nonprofit they received tax-free donations and they have a lot of goodwill in a sense that some researchers will choose to work at companies like that often for less money less compensation that they could get at one of these big tech giants but they they want to contribute they want to work in the nonprofit sector so that is also a a benefit Maybe it's a little bit more maybe hard to see, hard to define, but it's it's certainly there.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, you take in all this tax-free money and then you flip it and you transfer everything into a for-profit company. Is this fraud? Well, that as this lawsuit claims, there's a breach of a charitable trust, constructive fraud, promisory fraud, and unjust enrichment. So, I had to actually look that up exactly what those legal things mean. So, promisory promisory I think fraud is about the lie.

### 💭 セクション 24

So if they promised one thing and then did something else, that's what that is. And the constructive fraud is about the relationship. So if you have a fiduciary relationship with somebody like a money manager, they're supposed to act on your behalf. If they if they don't, if they act in a way that enriches them, well then you sort of you've defrauded [snorts] the person that on whose interest you're supposed to kind of be looking out for. So in this case, if it's a nonprofit, it's sort of a a public good.

### 📌 セクション 25

And so if you're doing something like that that's supposed to be for the public good and then you're using it to enrich yourself, then that that is constructive fraud. Again, if any of this can be proven. All right, but here's where it gets even more messy, a little more confusing because here's a Sam Alman posting. So he's taking this part where Sam Alman in the court filings and is saying that it was misrepresented and he's posting the actual September 2017 call notes. And notice in the core documents it says essentially a philanthropic endeavor, right?

### ✅ セクション 26

So essentially a for the public good. Here's what Sam is posting. So he's saying first of all it's Elon is the one that's saying this coming weeks top priority. Got to figure out how do we transition from nonprofit to something which is essentially philanthropic endeavor and is a BC corp or CC corp or something. So you see how immediately the story shifts a little bit, right?

### 📚 セクション 27

Because if Elon is the one that's suggesting it, then the story is different. Still, there might have been some shenanigans, right? If they wanted Elon out and they wanted to converted to the BC Corp or a for-profit entity, still that could have been deceitful. A lot of these things still apply. But from reading the various transcripts, it does seem like the court case is saying that they did this without Elon's knowledge.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Right? So Elon wants to stay a nonprofit. they behind his back execute this plan to transfer it to a forprofit. This I don't know if it directly contradicts that but it certainly kind of muddles it right because Elon's saying yeah we should transition from nonprofit to BC Corp or CC corp or whatever. So very quickly opening I post this after the core documents became public.

### 🎨 セクション 29

They titled this the truth Elon left out. And so they're saying so Elon cherry picks and publishes snippets from Greg Brockman's private journal entries that were obtained as part of the legal discovery. They're saying the truth is that we and Elon agreed in 2017 that a for-profit structure would be the next phase for OpenAI. Negotiations ended when we refused to give him full control. We rejected his offer to merge OpenAI into Tesla.

### 🚀 セクション 30

We tried to find another path to achieve the mission together and then he quit OpenAI encouraging us to find our own path to raising billions of dollars without which he gave us a 0% chance of success. And we read everything that they posted. This was from a while ago kind of all their notes and communications etc. And here at the end of 2018 so Elon is responding to Ilia Greg Sam and Siobhan Zillis. He's saying, "My probability assessment of OpenAI being relevant to Google Deep Mind without a dramatic change in execution and resources is 0%.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Not 1%. Zero. I wish it was otherwise. Even raising several hundred million won't be enough. This needs billions per year immediately or forget it." Unfortunately, humanity's future is in the hands of redacted.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, um, this is either Demi or or or Sergey that they're referring to. I I would guess. I'm just guessing. And so here are the September 2017 notes. So Greg Brockman saying over upcoming weeks how much of your time should we plan for Elon coming weeks top priority got to figure out how do we transition from a nonprofit to something which is essentially philanthropic endeavor and is a BC corp or CC corp or something.

### 🎬 セクション 33

It's important that we tell a story not lose a moral ground absolutely vital. Greg says yep. Elon says I need to understand a BC corp situation. Ilia Ilia Sutskar saying I have some thoughts one idea keep nonprofit and have CC corp. This was written some shorthand so there's words missing.

### 📋 セクション 34

I'm just reading it as it is. That's why it sounds a little bit weird. So Ilia continues, "But I find this approach less appealing because in some sense CC corp not beholden one formulation mission is to minimize X risk by building friendly AGI could be a way to go like it more as a new entity beholden to the mission." Elen says, "Agree does sound better. Never even heard of a BC Corp until Sam brought it up. It does sound like the right move.

### ⭐ セクション 35

would not shut down the nonprofit should still exist in some form. All right. And and Ilia agrees. They're talking about the name. They want to keep the name.

### 📝 セクション 36

No one says, "I agree. I think this makes sense. Well, I'm pretty excited about doing this with you." Ilia is saying, "And I in my head, I can I can just I can hear him say it. I can see him say it." If you've watched his interviews, he's he's got a very particular way of of of talking. And then you can just hear this in your mind's eye.

### 💡 セクション 37

is like all that's left is the minor thing of actually doing it, right? So like uh you know what's left? Oh, just do the thing. Like we've we we agreed to do you know to build AGI. Now what's left over?

### 🔧 セクション 38

Oh, just do it. Build AGI. Elon says all right cool. I'm going to figure out the details of the whole BC Corp thing tomorrow and get that process underway. And this is the commentary.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And this is the thing that I kind of find very interesting because obviously when you're running businesses, you're a public figure. There's a lot of stuff. You're always kind of trying to massage the image and kind of getting a pulse for what the conversation is out there, maintaining the moral high ground as they were discussing earlier, but there's also some things that are they're personal that you probably don't want out there. So, here they're talking about some of the more personal conversations that they're having. Obviously, I I wasn't there.

### 💭 セクション 40

I don't know if this is true or not. I don't know what the actual issues were. Most of these things like have you ever had this situation where like the more you try to figure out what happened between two people just the deeper and deeper it goes and you realize that the whatever they're fighting about on the surface isn't the actual thing. It's like layers and layers deep. But OpenAI's commentary is this.

### 📌 セクション 41

Elon did not think that OpenAI needed to remain solely a nonprofit. He agreed that OpenAI needed both a nonprofit and a for-profit entity. The exact structure OpenAI has today and that Elon is now suing OpenAI over. At the time, he said only that the nonprofit should continue to exist in some form. Elia, not Elon, suggested that the for-profit should have a connection to the OpenAI mission.

### ✅ セクション 42

Shortly after a call, Elon actually created the OpenAI PBC, so public benefit corporation or or BCorp. And despite his court filings glossing over the details of these negotiations, they were quite intense and involved deeply personal conversations. Elon said he wanted to accumulate 80 billion for a self-sustaining city on Mars and that he needed and deserved major equity. He said that he didn't need full control since he'd been burned by not having that in the past. Right?

### 📚 セクション 43

So he's saying, "Hey, in the past I I didn't have full control of something. I burned by that. Somebody, you know, betrayed him or screwed him over in some way." So he's saying he needs full control. And when we discussed Succession, he surprised us by talking about his children controlling AGI. Can you imagine that show succession but like in some future day and like the the main guy Logan is actually now Elon.

### 🔖 セクション 44

It's just the same thing but with that whole thing. I mean he was already portrayed in that TV show the succession he was this guy Matson. So you can imagine like a whole next season just with him as a new sort of center of power and all the kids kind of vying for it. Sorry that was a tangent. Getting back to the story discussions about the opening structure and Elon's proposal.

### 🎨 セクション 45

that he lead and control it progressed to the point that Elon asked us to check references with people who had worked closely with him. One pointed out the parallel to Elon's Mars ambition which had started as a philanthropic project and grew into a commercial one and mentioned that Elon tends to vilify people who quit his companies. And even before negotiating over Open's structure began, Elon leveraged OpenAI for the benefit of his for-profit ventures. For example, in early 2017, he asked Open to send a team to help fix Tesla's self-driving program, Autopilot. So, Scott Gray, Ilia, Greg, and Andre Karpathy ended up devoting significant time to improving autopilot, which led to Elon recruiting Andre to join the Tesla full-time.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Elon never truly treated OpenAI as an independent forprofit. Now, earlier I said Elon had some pull with Ilia Sutskcover. I think Elon was the one that kind of pulled him into OpenAI from Google, I believe. if I I don't recall, but here's kind of some more insight into that. So, this is a discussion between Sam, Greg, and Ilia.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So, here's Sam. I if I understand correctly, he's discussing what they should say to Elon. So, Elon's not in the room, not in this transcript, but he's saying say we tell him that we want to do OpenAI. If you want to do your own thing, your own AGI efforts inside Tesla, that's okay. And if weirdly competitive should revisit, right?

### 🌟 セクション 48

So maybe if it gets weirdly competitive then let's kind of take a step back and revisit it. So saying was thinking what we need. So maybe what resources do we need to succeed? Sam is saying it depends on how strategically dependent we would be could imagine a way that works. So he's saying how dependent are we going to be on Elon but he's saying he could imagine a way that doing this alone would work.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So next Ilia is saying that earlier he probably was more concerned maybe just in terms of survival getting this thing off the ground. Now, he doesn't want the only strategy to be Tesla. He doesn't want to be locked into something that's only Tesla. So, Greg is saying, if I understand correctly, are we okay with Elon doing his own thing, a a competitor? Basically, starting a competitor at Tesla.

### 📋 セクション 50

So, Sam is saying, well, that won't work. How little? So, maybe he's just implying that he doesn't have enough talent, employee knowledge. He just doesn't have enough to to spin up a credible competitor. by saying he would like e so Elon to stay on board and not go to war with open AAI.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So I don't think a full merger with Tesla will work. We need to tell him that. So maybe there can be kind of a compromise where he builds the hardware inside of Tesla that helps open AI. So kind of having the hardware and the AI the software kind of in different companies. So Ilia saying so if he's truly honest his preferences are not set in stone.

### 📝 セクション 52

So maybe BC Corp or nonprofit world. And here is Sam saying, and this is again kind of reading between the lines because this is kind of written in shorthand. He's saying, you know, let's talk about what involvement, what level of involvement should Elon have in this matter. Sam would prefer to have him involved, but he's much more interested in them, too. So, Ilia and Greg being motivated and not distracted.

### 💡 セクション 53

So, usually in a startup, you're just kind of focused on one thing. and here is kind of moving around quite a bit with Tesla and corporate structures and right so they're not just focused on EGI they're like all over the place the thing he cares about is the most optimum output if you guys are not happy with the nonprofit let's figure out the BC corp if you don't want E involved if you don't want Ellen involved we'll figure that out as well and he's saying he has weekly held views in terms of the corporate structure like he doesn't care he just wants to have those two guys fully happy and just ready to work and Ilia and Sam at breakfast. Conclusion is we truly want the BC Cororp. Honestly, we also just want to get back to work, but it's not super clear how he get there. So, the negotiations between OpenAI and Elon fell through in September 2018 because according to Openai, they wouldn't give him absolute control.

### 🔧 セクション 54

All right. So Greg and Ilia wanted to for them to commit to the nonprofit, give him two more board seats, agreed not to quit for some period of time, sign a non-solicit. But Greg and Ilia, they they thought about it, but they never signed because keeping it a nonprofit, you know, really crippled their ability to raise capital. And at the same time, Elon's ability to start a competitor, he could start a competitor without any consequences. And he had the resources, he could start it within Tesla or spin up a brand new one, etc.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Then a few weeks later, Elon told us it was a happy accident that the for-profit hand materialized as it never could have obtained enough funding. Instead, he began trying to convince us that merging open to Tesla was the only path to the mission. And it seemed that he would pursue an AGI competitor within Tesla regardless. But with that in mind, the actual November 6, 2017 notes. So, here it is.

### 💭 セクション 56

Again, I'm kind of going to translate this because this is written shorthand. I'll leave the links down below if you want to read for yourself and tell me if I'm mis mistransating it. I'm reading it to the best of my ability what's here and just adding some context. So they start with if he starts the competitor going to be less. So I'm reading this like if Elon starts the competitor which related to be XI then I think they're talking about their valuation.

### 📌 セクション 57

So it's going to be less. It's going to be reduced. Then this is the line from the transcript right? So we Greg is saying I don't want to commit. don't want to say that we're committed because then if three months later we're doing the BC Cororb then that was a lie and so he's saying I want to first see what the fundraising landscape looks like right that's that's because that's why I'm thinking going to be less they're talking about their valuation right so he wants to go out there see what the fundraising landscape looks like his hypothesis is that after robot hand and 5v5 so those were the two big sort of projects blog posts that they've published with the project behind them if you saw the early opening I think where there's a robot hand that's making the rub Rub's cube.

### ✅ セクション 58

So this is it, right? So one hand, one robotic hand is fixing is solving the Rubik's cube. So here's kind of what that looks like. So uh that would be very difficult. Would you be able to do it with one hand?

### 📚 セクション 59

But I mean it it did it apparently. And 5v5 is probably their Dota competition, their Dota AI that beat the five best players in the world at Dota. So he's saying after these two things, it's a totally different world. They kind of proved their worth. So the valuation will be higher.

### 🔖 セクション 60

they can they can do more fundraising etc. And here he's saying so if Elon starts a competitor he could see all this opportunity going away for them very very quickly and right now they're in this great position of power but it can go away quickly. So he's saying not feeling so great about all this. The true answer is that we want him out right so this seems like they want him out because of the some of the stuff they posted earlier. you know, him wanting for the kids to succeed him, him wanting full control, him wanting to accumulate the 80 billion for the Mars city, etc., etc., or whatever other interpersonal things that they had issues with.

### 🎨 セクション 61

But the point is, it seems like they want Elon out. They want to sever that tie. So, let me read to you what what they're writing. So, they're saying, "Okay, so talking to Siobhan, so guess is the leaison between OpenAI and Elon, she's like, how are you going to raise the billions in the nonprofit?" Of course, Elon isn't going to put personal money on the line. Not going to give up on Mars.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So, I'm reading this last part is Elon will not start a competitor, put millions or or billions into it. He's got his focus on Mars. And this is back to Greg. If he really thinks that AGI is going to happen first and be the craziest thing and change everything, then why not? So I think this is again Greg going, "Yeah, he just might because he really believes in AGI and thinks it's going to be a complete gamecher." So yeah, he might throw hundreds of millions or billions at this thing.

### ⚡ セクション 63

And here is kind of an interesting part. So the parts in blue is what was in the court transcript and the court documents. The parts in red was what was omitted that OpenAI is saying, "Hey, you need this context." So, Greg is saying, "Can't see us turning this into a for-profit without a very nasty fight." I'm just thinking about the office and we're in the office. So, I'm I'm I'm thinking this is like because Elon's paying for the office space for the employees. Um, you know, maybe he's saying this is we're in the office that he's paying for, right?

### 🌟 セクション 64

But then he continues and his story will correctly be that we weren't honest with him in the end about still wanting to do the forprofit and and this is the part that wasn't in the court documents. we're still wanting to do the for profit just without him, right? This kind of changes the the meaning a little bit or or maybe you would say quite a bit. And this next part was, you know, he was like, "Okay, fundraising is super hard." So, I'm guessing this this purple stuff is Greg's notes on what Elon said. So, the entire purple thing is Elon saying, "Hey, fundraising is super hard.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Like, he does a good job of it. All these people just send money, they don't show up." But he's basically describing how difficult it is. He's saying when the investors when they see the 10 billion, they're going to run for the hills. They're not going to want to invest in something with that big of a requirement. So, one of the two of us is not based in reality.

### 📋 セクション 66

But, he was super supportive of us trying. So, Elon is super supportive saying, "Go ahead. I'm I'm happy with it. We can give him a fancy title. We can diminish his own title." So, Elon will kind of take a step back to make them seem like they're a bigger deal than they are, you know, the investors.

### ⭐ セクション 67

and he's saying, "If you can do it, then I want to learn from you. I'm very good at getting people to part with their money. I could raise 1 billion for Tesla in a week." And have you seen that company's financials? So, this was, if you recall, this was like production hell for for Tesla as they were trying to release Model 3 or I don't recall if it was released or being under production. I think maybe the number of them produced was was under what was promised.

### 📝 セクション 68

So, I mean, on paper, everything looked horrible and yet he's raising money. The stock was doing well. So he's kind of flexing on Greg here saying I I could do this and what you guys are going to try to do is is impossible even for for him. So Greg is saying anyways definitely the best this meeting could have gone. We now have a focus a goal and if we accomplish it then we'll really have shown him that we can outperform him at something he's great at.

If we fail well we'll deal with it then. And this is the other part of the core documents. saying, "By the way, another realization from this is that it would be wrong to steal the nonprofit from him to convert it to a BC Corp without him. That would be pretty morally bankrupt and he's really not an idiot." And finally, the commentary. So again, we kind of covered this before, but Ilia and Greg, it's not that they had one idea, one sort of intention, and they were just lying to Elon about their intention again.

### 🔧 セクション 70

So that's that's the their version of events. Elon has his. They have something different. So Greg and Ilia felt that it would be deceptive to accept Elon's terms and then later create a forprofit without his approval. So they they didn't want to lie to him and then later do something different.

### 🎯 セクション 71

That that seems like a very ethical move. So they were nervous that by accepting they get stuck in a structure that was unable to raise sufficient capital while Elon left to pursue his own AGI projects at Tesla. That's why they decided not to accept his proposal. So, as they're saying here, they felt that they needed to try to please Elon to try to keep him on board even though they thought that it would facilitate the pursuit of the mission. Ilia feeling like we morally should not be kicking Elon out and we should be trying to make the nonprofit work and convince him to stay.

### 💭 セクション 72

So, again, from from their perspective, how they're laying everything out here, everything was above board. They just had some issues with the demands that Elon gave them and they just wanted to find some solution that worked for for them worked for Elon kind of find a compromise. So in conclusion they're saying that in the beginning it seemed pretty amicable. Everything was fine. Siobhan seems to be kind of moderating when when Elon lashed out.

### 📌 セクション 73

But then Elon prepared to launch XAI and Siobhan stepped off the board. Elon began the campaign of harassment that he's waging now with the relentless public attacks and various lawsuits and he's tried to gain competitive ground for XAI. So, this is going to be pretty wild. So, Elon contributed a total of 38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding. He did tons of other stuff to have to help OpenI get started.

### ✅ セクション 74

And now looks like in April this lawsuit is going to trial. Elon Musk commented, "I've lost a few battles over the years, but I've never lost a war." So, we'll see how this whole thing unfolds. If Elon wins, it'll be interesting to see exactly what the results of that will be. Currently on Kali, you know, the bet will Elon win his case against OpenAI. Looks like it's it's hovering just around 60%, just a little bit over 60%.

### 📚 セクション 75

$155,000 looks like is the trading volume. Whatever the case, I think we're going to hear a lot more about this as this goes to trial. Here's Greg Brockman saying that a lot of this was cherrypicked by Elon or Elon's lawyers. They had agreed that a for-profit was the next step. How the quotes were cherrypicked from his personal journal was beyond dishonest.

### 🔖 セクション 76

And the context was about whether to accept Elon's draconian terms. Interestingly, also it looks like there's a lot of other stuff in the deposition that could have additional context. There's an entire Greg Brockman deposition with some parts highlighted. There's tons and tons of stuff which I haven't gone through it. It does sound like a lot of what he's saying.

### 🎨 セクション 77

It's what we just covered from the the meetings that opening I posted etc. But one interesting thing that Greg ends with here is saying out of respect for Elon and to avoid discrediting him the whole time we were working together and even even after he quit we tried to avoid correcting his false narratives in public. Looking forward to finally having the opportunity to talk about the real history of OpenAI. So definitely it seems like they're both sides are going to war. I'm going to hear both sides of the story and get a lot more visibility and insight into how Open AI formed.

### 🚀 セクション 78

But let me know what you think. Who are you leaning towards? Do you think one of the sides is more dishonest than the other? Do you think it's kind of one of those things where it's just a disagreement? There's no clear-cut right or wrong, and it's kind of everybody has their own stories.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Let me know what you think. I'm I'm curious. So, I hope you enjoyed that. I hoped it helped shine some light on what's happening and make sure to tune back in for season two that starts in April. That's when the lawsuit goes to trial.
