## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Hello. Hope you are doing well. Uh first just want to say a happy new year. Hope you had a good start to 2026. Uh this video is not going to be long.

### 📋 背景・概要

I'm just going to talk a bit about what I plan to do with this channel in the upcoming year because yeah, I've done this for 3 years now and I had a really good time. But uh I think I want to do something a bit more different. And if you kind of saw the thumbnail, uh I think it's time just to start using this everything we learned the last three years, right? And just turn it into something that is more yeah and what do you call it like uh more actually impacting the world, right? Actually you can make some money of it, you can do other things, get connections, networking and stuff like that.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So basically I think this year is going to be mostly for me about covering how I actually use AI to create these micro businesses that uh generates money for me. Uh I will also sorry [clears throat] cover major releases like models and stuff like that and I will try to cover some of my best workflows to share how I use it right that I have been doing. But I think the main focus for me this year is just going to be sharing how I am going along with AI, how I'm actually using this technology to create small businesses that I turn into revenue, right? Uh because I think that uh is I think that's the next step. I think that's the right thing to do now.

### 📝 詳細説明

Taking what we learned the last three years into practice, right? Uh I think that's going to be interesting. And I'm going to do I I plan to do like one week uploads where I kind of cover everything I did that week. I'm going to cover the revenue. We're going to do spreadsheets and stuff like that.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And yeah, I think it's just going to be interesting. And hopefully you can learn something from it too. Uh I will try to cover like details and stuff. But uh maybe I have to create a Patreon or something where I do all the details. Uh we'll see.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

We'll see. Uh but first let me show you something I've been working on during the Christmas. just a small example of businesses I have kind of started up this Christmas and how they are doing. So the first thing I wanted to show you is uh I get a lot of like comments and stuff like people don't believe that this is working. Uh I just don't get it because I'm doing I've been doing this all last year, right?

### 🎯 応用例

And I've shared a lot of it on this channel. So you can see I started this small channel that's going to be like a a funnel into something else I think we can do some good revenue from. And this only has two uploads. Uh the first was December 23 and the second one was uh December 29 and we already got uh 100,000 views and it's still Yeah, we got 110,000 views the last 48 hours. 126 subscribers.

### 💭 考察

So yeah, I just wanted to show you that this still works. There's no issues. Uh still this is still working great, right? And this is a very good start to get eyes on your products, right? If you want to do some revenue using this technology.

### 📌 まとめ

Uh I also kind of did the same over on another platform. This is on um Tik Tok. And you can see the results are pretty much the same, right? Like 584,000 views, 23% watch video, 4,000 shares, favorites, 4,000 shares, 67,000 likes, and stuff like that. And you can see this clearly works still, right?

### ✅ 結論

because if it didn't I wouldn't be doing it right and I always explore new things and stuff we can do using this technology and I wanted to show you one more thing so the latest tool I've been working on is just a simple tool okay so we have an issue here let's see what that is a simple tool that's yeah you can see we can go into look at what is trending if you want to do this videos right we can check out top YouTube shorts so you can see these are all the top shorts in the last seven days or something. So, this is a tool I'm creating that I'm probably going to set up. So, you can kind of click on this and you can >> traffic sucks. So, we're going to give people money. >> Yeah, you get the point.

### 📚 追加情報

You can check out these videos. You can see we did kind of the same on Tik Tok where you can get trending if you just want to check out what is working at the moment. So, this is a tool I plan to launch right in 2026. And to be honest, I think it's going to be a really good tool. And I have some analysis.

### 🔖 補足

I think I'm going to work into this. And I think this is going to be one of the first tools I'm going to launch in 2026 that uh I think can do some revenue. We'll see how I set it up. But uh of course, I'm a heavy user of Cloud Code now because I got a lot of projects I got to maintain, right? And I'm just on the max plan now on Opus 4.5, right?

### 🎨 セクション 13

And I've been super happy over the Christmas. We got more chime and I'm doing parallelization and stuff like that. I plan to cover a bit on this channel in 26 and I'm still kind of working on my the AI videocourse.com platform. I'm updating some stuff over there. So yeah, I have a lot of things planned for 2026.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Uh but mainly like I said, the focus is going to be on these three things. uh covering my AI micro businesses, covering major releases and workflows, right? And I hope to bring a lot of value. That is something I always want to do because yeah, I just think it's interesting figuring out new things. Maybe you don't have to spend that amount of money.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Uh I can maybe do some sponsorships and stuff like that to cover the costs and you can get all the value, right? That is I what I hope to do. Uh but on the AI micro businesses things h it gets a bit too much to cover everything on YouTube. So maybe I'll do some kind of Patreon or stuff where I can have more freely recording and explaining things because on YouTube it's got to be some kind of structured. Uh I guess we could do live streams but then I kind of lose my attention and stuff.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So maybe we'll see if I'm going to do a Patreon or something. But I think it's going to be a lot of value in 2026. more longer videos, maybe like 30 to 40 minutes, where I cover everything I did the previous week. So, if this sounds interesting to you, give this video a like so I know if you want to follow along. Other than that, yeah, wish you all a good weekend and I see you next week for kind of the first new style of
