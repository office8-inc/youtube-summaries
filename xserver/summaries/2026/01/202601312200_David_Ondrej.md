## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

If I were to structure the Bible, I would probably start it with the book of Proverbs. I'm not really religious, but the book of Proverbs has to be one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's really short. It's I don't know 30 40 pages, but the amount of wisdom in those pages is truly incredible. And also the breadth of topics, just how many different aspects of lives that it covers.

### 📋 背景・概要

It's amazing. So, if you're not religious, but you're seeking ancient wisdom that is more relevant today than you think, read the book of Proverbs.
