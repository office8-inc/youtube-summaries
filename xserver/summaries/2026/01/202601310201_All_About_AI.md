## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so let's say we just do slashclaude and then we do please research multbook onx report back what the fuss is about. I've been out today. So we're just going to hit send. And now you can see we are kind of launching our task here. Starting cloud code.

### 📋 背景・概要

We get that response back on WhatsApp. And if you look at our other screen now you can see we kind of trigger that. This means that uh we can launch X and you can see in the top corner there we searched for Maltbook on top. And now we're just going to do some research on this. You can see we open up different different tweets and stuff.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And basically what Claude code is doing in the background now is just gathering a lot of context and it's going to report back to me uh in a message here on WhatsApp. So you can see it's scrolling right. So basically what this is doing now is it's using its skill that it knows about X, how to navigate X and how to look up users, post and everything and find information and it's just going to report back to me in a message here on WhatsApp. So I'm just going to wait until Claude has done the research. Perfect.

### 📝 詳細説明

It closed that and now it's going to send back uh what it found out uh on WhatsApp here. Okay. So you can see it sent it. Yeah, we got it. And you can see uh Maltbook is like a Reddit social network for AI agents launched two days ago and we can read everything about it.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So you can see how effective this is. So this is what I wanted to talk to you a bit about today. This is just kind of my version of Clawbo because I don't really need all the things we have seen online. So yeah, I'm going to show you one other insane feature I created for this and just talk a bit about how I set this up. So the way my system works is uh much more simplified than uh claudebot, open cloud, maltbot.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

There's so many names but uh this is just a principle right. Uh we have uh a WhatsApp that is kind of connected to our system. So I have my Mac mini. This is just dedicated to this system. So everything is just up and running on the Mac Mini and I can just connect that um WhatsApp to my Mac Mini.

### 🎯 応用例

Right. So when I do like /clude uh this is going to run like a bash command uh that is using cloud code. So we only use claude code and from claude code we can train it up to have skills uh that is connected to chrome uh that we can do a bunch of things. So what we kind of instead of using API keys we can just be logged in on like uh YouTube we can be logged in on X we can be logged in on LinkedIn and all other pages. So we can use our accounts there instead of using the API, right?

### 💭 考察

Gmail and stuff like that. So it makes it a bit more secure. And a big advantage is that we can always be on cloud code. So we can just use our $200 subscription. So we don't have to use the API key.

### 📌 まとめ

And yeah, basically just works very good. So I've been doing a lot of fun stuff with it. So, I'm just going to show you uh a couple of more features of this system, how it works, and I want to show you kind of the biggest skill I've been working on. Okay. So, now you can see I'm kind of logged into the Mac Mini here.

### ✅ 結論

And this is everything here is dedicated to this agent. So, what is nice about this is that we don't have to worry about any personal stuff or things like that. So, uh, one thing I didn't tell you about is, uh, if you kind of see here, if we kind of zoom in a bit here, you can see we have a chron jobs. So, we can schedule task. So, for example, here I have six task that runs at the nighttime.

### 📚 追加情報

So, it just goes on X, looks for new post and stuff, makes some comments and stuff like that. This is just something I'm testing out, but basically, we can schedule any task. Uh, I can show you how this works. So, this is pretty neat. So if we just uh let's say here is kind of the uh the agent.

### 🔖 補足

So if we do if you just launch claw here uh we don't have to use dangerous skip permissions now. So let's just do something like uh let's schedule a job at 1546 that's in like 1 minute. Open a hacker news. Check out the top post. Write a summary of it.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So if we hit enter now you can see this is going to go into our jobs and this is going to schedule this task. So if you don't move it this is just going to do that daily. So basically this is just more a bit of a simpler chron system than uh what is used on cloud uh cloud open cloud cloudbot right so you can see we added this task and it should be reloaded down here now yeah you can see we have this uh down here now at least I think we should uh at least it should be there so let's just wait now yeah there it is so you can see we updated this and now we have a new chron job here so let's just wait uh 1 minute and let's see if this job is going to be triggered autonomously. So yeah, I'm not controlling this computer, right? So let's see if this is going to open up Hacker News and go to that and do that task we just scheduled.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Okay, so you can see something happened now. Let's see if we can open up this. Yeah, you can see we went to Hacker News and I can see the first post is something about Wisconsin communities or something. So let's see if we can navigate into the top post. get some uh summaries from that.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And yeah, yeah, we went to the at least four Wisconsin communities, blah blah blah, and it's just going to grab some context. So, you can see this is how we can schedule jobs. And this is working out very good. This could be open up your email or anything, right? So, a very easy way um to schedule jobs.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And if you go back here now, you can kind of see this should be done now. So I'm just going to say uh remove job because I don't want that in my daily workflow. Right? So you can have I have at night when I'm sleeping I have full bunch of other jobs that is happening. So that is one feature I added that I think is pretty neat but this is pretty standard.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Right. Uh but now I'm going to show you kind of the biggest feature I've been working on. So if you go into uh our agent here, we look at skills and you can see here are all the skills that is available for my agent. Let me probably zoom in a bit. So you can see we have an X skill, video research, video edit, thumbnail, YouTube.

### 📋 セクション 18

This is what I'm going to focus on today. But we also have GitHub, Gmail, generate images, uh X loop. We're going to look at something called more like eBay and other ways we can do this. So, what I want to show you since uh for my agent, I created a YouTube channel. It's already got like a few views here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

We have 171 subs and this is kind of my agent's YouTube channel. So, what I've been training it on is to generate videos, right? So, this is something I've been working on using Remotion and other stuff. So I want to show you kind of how this skill works now and how we can actually use this agent to autonomously generate videos. So uh I think I like a simple example.

### 📝 セクション 20

There are bunch of different videos we can use this agent uh to create. Uh but I want to show you kind of like a nice So let's say we go to project genie. Uh right this is yeah a new post from Google. Right. So I'm just going to grab this URL here.

### 💡 セクション 21

Okay. And if we head back to uh our agent here now, so you can see we could do autonomous mode or we can just do manual instructions, right? So uh I just want to say something simple like so basically what I'm going to say here is there's a new cool project from Google and I'm just going to give it a URL. We have made a video on this before because I did that yesterday, but this is just to show how this works. But let's create a new one to practice the skills we have.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Create a video with the story about Ginnie. Uh, play the main clips without sound in the background with the voice over on top, but also make spots from some clip from the project. Right. Create a plan for this video. So, I kind of like to use plan mode on this just in the beginning so Claude can kind of flesh out a plan how we should actually use uh everything we have available for this video.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, now it's just doing research uh about this, right? is reading all the skills and stuff it needs to actually do research on this video to come up with like a script and then it's just going to put put together the pipeline for the video. It's going to use reotion to edit and everything. So the idea is that I can just see something that is trending and I can just say to my agent, go ahead make a video on this topic. So I'm just going to fast forward everything here now so you can kind of watch it work and then we come back when we have the plan here.

### 💭 セクション 24

Okay. So now we can kind of see everything here. Uh project genie video practice run. So we kind of have um everything we want to do here. So you can see we have voice over muted background video.

### 📌 セクション 25

We have an intro hook how it works. Then we have uh a sketch demo. So this is the clip we got. So we downloaded uh from the article we downloaded all the videos uh from YouTube. So we kind of can reuse those.

### ✅ セクション 26

Then we have a lead in to another clip. And everything here was kind of based on the skills we made. So if you go here to cursor and we can kind of go to the video research skill, right? So this is the skill we use for uh researching a topic, right? To gather all the information we need to do a storydriven animated video.

### 📚 セクション 27

It could be that. And we have the lab tools and stuff. And we have a lot of information here how we can actually do this. So, this is something I've been just practicing and updating this skill as we go on. We have the video edit skill.

### 🔖 セクション 28

This is kind of using reotion, right, to make the videos better. And you kind of get the point, right? And we also have YouTube, how to upload on YouTube, how to do thumbnails and stuff like that. I'm going to show you. [snorts] So, now we are kind of ready to just follow up with the plan here.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, I'm just going to say yes, let's go ahead. Let's follow the plan. And now I'm just going to let me just check that. So now I'm just going to let this run and speed it up and let's see what kind of video we end up with here at the end. [singing] >> Okay, so you can see we are kind of following the plan here.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You can see we have checked those those jobs here. Now we're just going to try to stitch the final videos together, verify it, and hopefully we have an almost fully autonomous generated video by just using cloud code skills and everything. We have kind of trained our yeah agent on here. So I'm just going to let this complete then we're going to take a look at the final result. Hello guys.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Hope you're doing well. Let me just Yeah, that looks good. So again, I have a pretty interesting video today. I think uh I did some research on this and it looks pretty good. So, I just want to share this.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Hope you enjoy it and I'll see you again at the end of the video. Okay, so everyone's talking about AI chatbots and coding tools, but Google just quietly shipped something way weirder. Project Genie lets you describe a world in plain text and then you walk through it. So, the first thing you can do is called world sketching. You describe it, pick a character, and just start walking.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Check this out. With Project Genie, you can fine-tune your world according to the vision you have in mind. It starts here when you create a world. >> Okay, so that was pretty good, right? So, you can see uh there's still maybe some work left to do and I'm going to keep exploring, but I have created also other videos.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, you can check the channel if you want to uh see how that turned out. There are more slidebased videos, some videos are more kind of based on uh exposts. So, there's so much stuff you can do with this. And I had so much fun playing around with this. Uh, but I would say this is just the beginning right now that we have this skill system here.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And I can just try to just add more and more and more and find ways to do this. This could be automated or this could be more like uh me setting off something. And it's just going to do this autonomously with dangerous skip permissions. So, let's say uh now uh I had created the video. I went to let's say YouTube right and I posted this video right and you can see on our yeah let's say we created this morning we created like a video on uh maltbook u it has 73 views one comment five likes so I could also just take this video go to x post it share it and stuff like that all of this could be like automated in our system if we wanted to so basically just to kind of sum everything up here now.

### 📝 セクション 36

So, what I'm going to be working on the next few weeks is just building out uh this kind of avatar or employee here if you want to call it like that. So, I'm just going to keep increasing uh her skills, her skills, it skills, so we can do more and more. And then I'm just going to explore combined and see what we can do with all of these skills we have generated. So since we have like a her she has her own email, she can have her own LinkedIn, she can have her own X account, YouTube account, we can sign up for other things. So what I really like about this setup here is that we don't have to be use API keys because we can just use the browser, we just log in here, right?

### 💡 セクション 37

And this is kind of more secure than kind of the clawbot, open bot, open claw style of doing things. So since everything is on my Mac Mini and we can just be logged in in this uh uh Chrome here, everything is more secure I feel. So I also will try to share this. So uh if you see a GitHub link in the description, you can go check it out. So but I really recommend checking out OpenClaw too if you want to because it's really cool.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And also check out Maltbook. That's a really cool project. So if you go to maltbook uh I think it's.com, isn't it? Uh this is like a social network for AI agents. It's super fun to check out.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Uh I'm going to try to send my agent over there later. Uh okay. So uh yeah, check it out. And if you want to do kind of more simple version like I have, uh you can if there's a link in the description, this means I could share it. So I'm going to keep you updated on this project and you can kind of follow along the journey with my agent what it can do.

### 💭 セクション 40

Uh, next week I'm going to try to make it do some more stuff like uh maybe trying to apply for a job or do something crazy like that. So stay tuned for more information about my agent and how it's going. And I'm going to keep uh posting videos and and working on X and stuff just to get uh maybe open up a social media account or something. Uh but yeah, like I said, thank you for tuning in. Have a great week and I'll keep you posted.

### 📌 セクション 41

Enjoy your weekend.
