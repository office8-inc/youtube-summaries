## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, Cloth Code can now make videos. You tell it what you want in plain English, and it creates professional animations from scratch. It's insane. For example, this entire video you're watching right now was made just by typing into close code. No animations, no touching UI, plain English.

### 📋 背景・概要

Now, you might be thinking, "But David, how is this even possible?" Well, all of this is powered by Remotion, which lets us create videos programmatically. But now, Remotion has released their own agent skills, which means that Cloud Code, Open Code, and other AI agents can finally use it. So, in this video, we'll go over what Remotion is, how to set up these new agent skills, and how to actually use it for your own AI marketing to grow your business. So, make sure to watch until the end. Here's another example of what this Remotion skill can do.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Now, everything except for the design of the characters was generated and stitched together with cloth code. So, this entire video you're watching was created with cloth code. someone typing English and clothes code designing a video of this video game. Crazy. Here's another example that was made with Remotion, Clothe code and anti-gravity.

### 📝 詳細説明

Now, personally, I'm not a animator or a designer and doing something like this would take me many, many hours because I would first have to learn these softwares. But now, you can just type to close code and close code will build it for you. So, not only can you use AI to build your product, now you can use AI to market it as well. It has never been a better time to start your own business. Okay.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, what is remote? What's the thing that makes all of this possible? Well, Remotion is a framework for creating videos programmatically using Rust. And the code looks something like this. You can think of it as a website that gets recorded frame by frame into a video file.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So you get the data either from APIs, databases or user input. And then each of the render that motion makes produces a unique video automatically. Now the reason why AI agents love it is that they are great at writing code. So whether it's cloud code, open code or any other coding agent, they already excel at writing code. However, these same agents are terrible at using complex graphical user interfaces like After Effects, Premiere Pro or any other app designed for humans.

### 🎯 応用例

Remotion fixes this. It turns video creation and animations into React components. So all the agents have to do is write a few React components and the result is a beautiful looking video or animation. So any of you that are building your own app or you have your own business, here is how you could use remotion to create product videos. So this is another one built just with cloud code and just with a motion.

### 💭 考察

Look at this professional looking animation of email looks like Gmail highlighting moving cursor text. You would have to pay thousands of dollars to an animator or designer to do this. Now it's just a few prompts to glot code with the motion skill. And of course I'm going to show you how to set it up later in the video, but I just want to show you how impressive this really is. Here's one more example.

### 📌 まとめ

Now, obviously, this guy gave it these assets, right? So, if you have great quality images or assets, it will do even better. But the animation cycling between them was built by Remotion. By the way, this agent skill came out literally less than 24 hours ago. So, if you want to stay on the cutting edge of AI, make sure to subscribe.

### ✅ 結論

It takes 2 seconds and it helps out a lot. Thank you. Now, let's look at how Remotion works under the hood. The first thing you have to understand is the sequence components. And these place elements in time, just like in any video editing tool, you have a something like a timeline.

### 📚 追加情報

And each of these are sequence components. Now, when you start your development server with npm rundev, you get a local host player, something like this, where you can scrap through your video in real time and actually see what the different sections look like. And when you're ready and when you want to actually render it, each of the frames gets screenshotted and stitched into an MP4 through FFmpeg. Now, let's talk about agent skills because this is a relatively new concept that most people don't understand. Agent skills are instruction files that teach AI coding agents like close code and open code how to work with specific tools.

### 🔖 補足

Now, the beauty of agent skills is that they use what's called progressive disclosure. You don't just dump a bunch of tokens, a bunch of prompts into context window. That would be wasteful. Instead, cloth only loads the skills full instructions when your task matches its description. So, if your task is about coding, it's not going to load the skills about video editing.

### 🎨 セクション 13

But if your prompt does mention video editing, it will load the skills about video editing. This progressive disclosure principle always keeps the context lean. Now skills are an open standard meaning it's something like MCPS something that's becoming like the agents.mmd file right something that more and more companies and agents are adopting across the whole AI ecosystem so today skills work across cloth code agent zero open code and many other agents so the big news here is that remotion created their own agent skill that you can just plug and play into these agents and have them creating professional animations right away. Now, this emotion skill contains all of the API patterns for emotion, the different component conventions and best practices for writing animations. So, when you ask CL to create a video, it reads these instructions and generates proper emotion code.

### 🚀 セクション 14

The skill also bundles reference docs for specific topics like 3D audio captions. So, Claude only loads whatever it needs for that task. And since Remotion is very easy to use because you just type to cloth code and cloth code runs the code, people are creating impressive animations on their first try, which you're watching right now. This was made with just a couple of prompts on the very first try. Now, there are some clear best practices that will decide whether you get mediocre results with this skill or whether you get great animations from the motion.

### ⚡ セクション 15

First off, always start with a clear storyboard. You need to describe each scene before prompting cloth. Also, the best results require an iterative approach instead of trying to oneshot everything. Start with small prompts, see the result, adjust the prompt, so on and so forth. Usually, the best motion animations I've seen required five to 10 prompts at least.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And pro tip, make sure to keep your compositions modular. So, build reusable components for intros, transitions, outros. Don't try to put everything into a single component. And as I said earlier, give it high quality assets. Right?

### 🎬 セクション 17

If you're building a video game, give it the sprites. If you're designing a product, give it high quality product photos. The better assets you provide, the better the outcome will be. And now, let me show you how to actually set this up. First thing we have to do is go to remote.dev.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, make sure to click on this u npx create command. It will copy it into your clipboard. Then open a terminal and we need to cd into a folder where we want to build this. So, let's do cd documents get ls cd into David Andre. Boom.

### ⭐ セクション 19

All right. I'm going to paste the terminal command in this folder. Choose a blank template. Boom. Add tailwind.

### 📝 セクション 20

Yes. Add agent skills. Yes, for sure. And there we go. Open a cursor.

### 💡 セクション 21

Yes. There we go. Here's our project with a full remote setup. Let me close some of these sidebars that always pop up. So, you can see we have everything on the right that we need for a blank motion project.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And what remains is installing the skill. Now, this is the skills.sh page developed by Versel. I'm going to link this below the video, but again, you just need to click this to copy the terminal command. Go back to the terminal. Type in clear and paste it in.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Yes, we want to install this package. There we go. We have the skills. Select agents. We're going to use cloth code.

### 💭 セクション 24

And here you can select whether you want to install Remotion for just this project or globally. It's up to you. Installation method. Let's do Sim. And let's proceed with installation.

### 📌 セクション 25

Done. And that's it. The setup is very simple. Again, if you're afraid of using the terminal, why? Like, you just copy paste a few commands and it asks you in plain English.

### ✅ セクション 26

Don't be afraid of the terminal. It's a limiting belief. In 2026, you must be using the terminal to be on the cutting edge of AI. Next up, let's go back into our IDE. And then let's open a terminal in this same folder.

### 📚 セクション 27

Type in cloth to launch CL code. Give it permissions for this folder. Go. Let me move it here. Let's do SLSkill to see if we have available skills.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And there we go. Project skills. Yes, promotion best practices. Amazing. Let's click escape.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So now it means that the skill has been successfully installed and cloud code knows about it. Now again I would recommend you to create a separate folder a clear directory for this. So that's what I did right here. You know I created a motion folder with this project folder and everything is happening in here so I'm not messing the files all across my computer. I'm going to run it in this folder and I'm going to let cloth code cook right here.

### 🚀 セクション 30

This is a great practice when working with any coding agents. Now when using remotion skill through cloth code, you have to remember that animations are created by simple prompts. So make sure to use a very detailed prompt and ask cloth to use the remotion skill. So I just pasted it as well so that I give Claude context on what you're doing. The next thing I would recommend you to do is to ask CL to create a separate subdirectory for each animation to keep things organized.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So basically you'll have like one root folder like this and this shouldn't have any animations right here because you'll have multiple subfolders for each of the animations. All right. So clo understands it and now it has all the context. So we can start building our first animation. So let's create a new folder and I'm going to name it prompts and I'm going to create a new file in there named prompt01.md.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And this is going to be our first prompt. As you can see it's very detailed and that's because I want a great result for this animation. So, it's going to be a visual animation in the style of free blue, one brown. If you don't know this channel, you're greatly missing out. This is one of the best YouTube channels when it comes to math education, also some videos on AI, LLM, how does Bitcoin work.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Really great channel, and it's known for having beautiful animations. So, we're going to use Remotion to try to replicate his style. Now, this is a very detailed, obviously written with AI as well, but very detailed uh description of what we want to build. So, you should be as detailed as possible when using remote. Actually, we can probably delete several of these.

### 📋 セクション 34

All right, just cleaned up a bit. I'm going to interrupt this. Okay, I'm going to tell it to stop regressing, read prompt 01, and actually build it using the remote skills you have. Boom. Enter.

### ⭐ セクション 35

As you can see, the prompt is 400 lines. Very detailed prompt. And now, let's watch Claude do the magic. So, now uh it's asking to use the skill. So, I'm going to select yes.

### 📝 セクション 36

And don't ask again because uh I don't need to accept this skill every single time. As you can see, it's loading specific things. Animations MD, timing.md, and sequencer MD. So it's not loading everything from the skill, only the parts it needs. And this is the progressive disclosure, right?

### 💡 セクション 37

This is this is what's keeping the context engineering optimal. So now it's creating all subdirectory right here. Pythagorean. So there it goes. Clothe code is running the react code for remote.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So this is uh like 77 lines of code. is 81. It's doing different components. So, very nice. One for the animated line, one for triangle, one for square.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, it's creating reusable components. That way, we can reuse them. It's in the word opening index. It's creating a lot of files. So, I'm interested in this animation.

### 💭 セクション 40

All right, let's do npm rundef. See what this looks like. This is the motion UI. So far, we don't have anything, but this is what it will look like. It's similar to any video editing tool as you can see.

### 📌 セクション 41

Let's go to the main cloth code. Still cooking up the animation. 17,000 tokens going for 4 minutes. So the best animations take some time. This is not like a single thing that you're going to get like in 1 second because keep in mind cloud code has to write hundreds of lines of code for these different React components because remote works on React.

### ✅ セクション 42

Oh, there we go. Okay, so the main cloud code finally updated root.tsx tsx by registering these different components. I like this new cloud code UI. It's very clean. Oh, never mind.

### 📚 セクション 43

That's crazy. [laughter] I I complement the new design and it breaks completely. Anyways, uh it's removing the unused variables now. So, hopefully we won't get any other llinter errors. 10 minutes, guys.

### 🔖 セクション 44

10 minutes for this animation. It's pretty insane. Few like cloth core few months ago would never run for 10 minutes. So, Enthropic is making it less lazy. There is a complete.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Okay, let's see. All right, there we go. There we go. The Pyan proofs animation is complete. Here's what was created.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Project structure, main orchestrator, self-drawing lines, triangle intro. Okay, let's see. ID by figure and proofs duration 2,400 frames, 40 seconds at 60 fps. To preview, run npm rundef and select py proofs composition in the motion studio. So, let's do that.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Let's kill this. Boom. NPM rundev. On the left, we have the compositions. Let's select pyan proofs.

### 🌟 セクション 48

And as you can see, we have a timeline with multiple different sequences. So, let's run it. This is pretty nice. Okay, guys. This is this is wild.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Let me make this bigger. This is actually crazy. Written by cloth code. Imagine having to do this by yourself. Doing this manually would take forever.

### 📋 セクション 50

single prompt in plain English. Okay, some of these are wrong order obviously but again one prompt this is wild. Okay, this is mis a little misaligned but hey nothing you can't fix in future prompts and again all of this is code so all of this is programmatic okay so let me give you one more example this time with some assets so I'm going to create a new prompt new file prompt O2 boom paste it in a little shorter almost 200 this is going to be a advertisement for cloth code so I have this u image right here cloth startp is just a you a screenshot of the cloud code UI. So I'm going to say read prompt O2 and using cloud startup create the animation in remotion. The fewer lines of code, the better.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Don't want it to be running for 12 minutes again. Let's see if it remembers the subfolder directory because that's what we instructed it to create subfolders for each. So it moved the PNG file into public. Okay, because uh I guess that's where assets go. And now it created the cloth ad subfolder which is empty for now.

### 📝 セクション 52

It's going to create the whole folder structure for a motion composition. So again inside of the browser you can have different compositions, right? This is the default one and this is the pyan proof one. Can split it up to 4x and on the sequence below you can like disable different parts, right? So maybe you don't want this one.

### 💡 セクション 53

You can hide it. It's a it's a proper video editor. like it's not as advanced as Premiere obviously, but uh it's solid. It's solid and everything is programmatic. Everything is react code and you can see your assets right here.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So obviously we have the clo startup file and now we have the clo add. So we can see it's being built in real time. Clothe ad is here. Okay, let's zoom out to fit. Look at this.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Is it finished yet? Okay, this one's faster. Okay, 2 minutes composition code add duration 17 seconds. Cursor moves to do terminal icon click. Let's look at this.

### 💭 セクション 56

Let's play it in 1x from the beginning. So, we have a desktop view here. Make it a bit bigger. So, the term go icon clicks. Okay, it didn't click on the terminal.

### 📌 セクション 57

It clicked on the browser, but it opens the terminal. It types in cd subscribe to the channel. Very nice. Look at this guys. This is crazy.

### ✅ セクション 58

This is all code. This is all animated. Let me replay this. Like doing this manually if you're not an animator would take a lot of time. It's a advertisement for cloud code in a single prompt less than 2 minutes.

### 📚 セクション 59

Obviously, this one was a lot faster than the previous one and it has less detail, but you can follow it up. You can say like change the background gradient to be cloud orange color instead. Boom. And let's watch it change in real time. There we go.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Change the clothes code. Already much better. Already feels way more like cloth code. You literally animating by typing plain English. If you're not using cloth code in 2026, you are falling behind.

### 🎨 セクション 61

In 2026, you really cannot afford to fall behind. Now, if you want to take things to the next level and actually start an AI business this year, I made a full video on just on that. It's going to be right here on the screen. So go wash it out.
