## 💡 概要

2026年にAI SaaSで収益を上げるための包括的なガイドです。アイデアの選定から技術スタック、デプロイメント、決済、認証、マーケティング戦略まで、実際にVectalを売却した経験を持つDavid Ondrejが、成功と失敗の両方から学んだ教訓を共有します。この動画は、AI SaaSビジネスを立ち上げたい起業家や開発者向けの内容です。視聴者は、主流の技術スタックの選択、適切な価格設定（70～95%の利益率維持）、MoR（Merchant of Record）の重要性、そして最も重要な「構築よりも配信に時間を使う」という原則など、実践的なビジネス知識を得られます。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **技術スタックはシンプルに**: Next.js、Tailwind CSS、shadcn/ui（フロントエンド）、Node.js/Python + FastAPI（バックエンド）、PostgreSQL（DB）など、主流で訓練データの多い技術を選択すべきです
- **Merchant of Recordの必須性**: Stripe単体ではなく、Polar、Lemon Squeezy、パラレルなどを使用して、150以上の国の税務処理を自動化することで、数ヶ月の開発コストを節約できます
- **配信に50%以上の時間を使う**: 1日4時間作業できる場合、最低2時間は配信（YouTube、コールドDM、コンテンツ作成）に充てるべきで、構築よりも重要です
- **年間プランで販売**: 月額30ドルではなく年額300ドルで販売することで、広告の顧客獲得コストを初日から回収でき、スケーリングが容易になります
- **最大の過ち10選**: アイデアに固執する、宣伝しない、誰でも使える製品を作る、値段が安すぎる、リリースに時間がかかりすぎる、機能過多、テスターがいない、などが主な失敗パターンです

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Building an AI SAS is one of the best ways to make money in 2026. And in this video, I'm going to show you everything you need to know to build one. From selecting the idea to AI tools to backend deployment, tech stack, payments, testing, authentication, and much much more. So, if you are serious about making money with AI, make sure to watch until the end. First off, let's talk about selecting the idea because if you choose the bad idea, everything else is not going to matter.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, first off, you need to build a painkiller, not a vitamin. Many of you are building a vitamin, something that people don't really need. You need to find a real pain, a real problem and deliver the painkiller. Also, choose an industry where you have expertise. Don't go somewhere where you're completely clueless.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Use any advantage you have. And please avoid mainstream stuff like Tinder butt for or AI trading bot or poly market arbitrage agent. Please avoid all that stuff. And in terms of where to look for ideas, you can go to Reddit and look for issues people have with existing softwares. You can look at what type of companies Y Combinator is funding.

### 📝 詳細説明

You can go on Twitter or X and look what's happening there. or you just can get a divine revelation and get the idea while you sleep. Next thing we need to look at is which AI tools to use. First of all, cloth code or open code for coding, right? You need an autonomous AI agent and these two are the best right now.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Then you need an IDE. So we're going to use cursor or VS code. Then CEX. This is also another coding agent. But Codex is exceptionally good for debugging.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It's way less lazy than cloud code. So definitely use Codex. Agent Zero for all kinds of manual tasks. You need to turn the logo into a favicon. You need to convert files.

### 🎯 応用例

You need to do some data analysis. Agent Zero will do it instantly. Perplexity for web search and deep research. Fireflies for meeting transcription when you're doing customer calls, stuff like that. And then you want something in your CI/CD for preventing bugs.

### 💭 考察

So either Code Rabbit or Bugbot, these are the AI tools you need. You don't need more. A lot of you are over complicating your AI stack. Keep it simple and just master a few AI tools. Speaking of stacks, let's look at the tech stack.

### 📌 まとめ

Right? So this is probably one of the most important points. Sometimes this doesn't apply for 100% of AI SAS, but for most of them, you're going to go with this, right? So let's look at front end. We're going with Nex.js.

### ✅ 結論

Very popular framework, fast improving, and has basically everything you need. Tailwind CSS for the styling and chats and UI for pre-built UI components. So you can build even faster for inference where you run inference of AI models. Open router you can have everything there. Literally all of the models that you can imagine are available on open router.

### 📚 追加情報

So you just integrate this and you can easily switch between models in your AI SAS or if you want more privacy focused approach. Venice AI is great. They're focused on unbiased AI and private AI. They're not collecting your data stuff like that. So these two are the only two inference providers you really need in terms of back end.js Python with fast API like these are the two mainstream text tags.

### 🔖 補足

Again, don't choose a text stack that's like esoteric, that's, you know, random, new. No, choose something that's super popular. As you can notice, Nex.js, Python, like these are all mainstream, right? The reason for that is there's a lot of training data in the AI models. So, the models can help you a lot.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, keep it simple. Don't overengineer your tech stack. Same with the database. Just stick to SQL, Postgress, that's all you need. If you want something faster, Reddis cache is great.

### 🚀 セクション 14

If you're not a senior developer with 10 plus years of experience, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot and you're going to waste so much time compared to if you just went with a popular proven tech stack. Next up is learning. Because if you want to build an AI SAS, you need to learn stuff every single day. So, first of all, deep research, right? Doesn't matter if it's perplexity, cloth, Gemini.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Use some sort of deep research to understand different topics. Next up, GBD 5.2 Pro. When something is very complex, includes a lot of details, a lot of nuance, take a few minutes to describe a great prompt, send it to GB 5.2 Pro and you're going to learn a lot. And lastly, just subscribe to my channel. It's completely free and I make videos on the cutting edge AI tools.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And in 2026, you need to master AI agents to stay ahead. So, make sure to subscribe to not miss any videos. Next, let's talk about the AI models themselves. So, right now, obviously, this is changing every month. But right now, Opus 4.5 is coded.

### 🎬 セクション 17

It's the best model basically for anything, but it's more expensive, right? So, these are the models to building. But if you are talking about using your app, Gemini free flash is great in the app, right? So, if you want cheap inference, Gemini free flash. If you want something to build a front end with, Gemini free pro is great.

### 📋 セクション 18

But in terms of development, Opus 4.5 basically for everything. GBD 5.2 CX for debugging. And then GLM 4.7. If you want to use an open source model, maybe you want to fine tune it, you have a large data set like that, then GLM4.7 is right now probably the best open source AI model. And again, you don't need to overthink this.

### ⭐ セクション 19

You don't need to be using 10 different models. Just use these. Trust me. Next up, we need to talk about GitHub because GitHub is like one of the most essential softwares you need to master. And a lot of you are scared about it for no reason, right?

### 📝 セクション 20

So, first of all, GitHub is the place where your code is stored. This makes deployment easy. Every platform integrates with GitHub. Instead of having a project on a your local machine and then you send somebody like a zip file, terrible. Never ever do that.

### 💡 セクション 21

You learn how to deploy on GitHub. Again, takes a few minutes to learn and it's a skill you're going to have forever. Also, you need to have a different main branch and dev branch, right? I know it's tempting to push straight into production, but if you want to build a serious ASIS, you should have a separate dev environment or a staging environment, but keep it simple. Also, you can use GitHub for your CI/CD.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Yeah, GitHub workflows is great. Everything integrates with it. So, if you master GitHub and if you use GitHub, it's going to give you a lot and it's going to simplify a lot of complexity that comes with building ASAs. And by the way, guys, we're just getting started. These were only three or four points from this whole video.

### 🎯 セクション 23

As you can see, this is very in-depth and there are so many gems and nuggets in this video. Honestly, I should have charged money for this. So, if you really do watch until the end, you're going to have so much clarity on what to do to build your ASAS. Next up, we need to talk about distribution because this is something that a lot of you guys are not doing enough. When you use AI, you can build super fast.

### 💭 セクション 24

You can add new features. You can improve the product. But to build a successful AI app, you need distribution. You need to do some marketing. You need to do some promotion.

### 📌 セクション 25

And you can do this and you should do this even before launching. A lot of you guys are waiting until the MVP is finished and then later I'm going to do you know promotion. I'm going to try to get customers. No, your biggest issue from day one of any business is not having customers. Now sometimes you might need to get an MVP up and running.

### ✅ セクション 26

You might need to have some sort of product. But you can promote even before you have everything ready. And there's two ways. Number one is weight list. You can create a free weight list where you collect their first name, last name, email, and phone number to get early access to the product.

### 📚 セクション 27

Second thing is a pre-sale. You can legit start collecting money before you launch. How, you might ask? You need to make a great offer. You need to give them either percentage off or some bonus personalized onboarding, some reason to pay you even before the launch.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And you can do the launch in 30 days or 60 days, whatever, right? But you need to start promoting and distributing before the launch. And also, you should spend at least two hours a day on this. Yes, I don't care who you are. I don't care if you have 17 kids.

### 🎨 セクション 29

I don't care about anything. If you have a full-time job, if you are able to allocate 4 hours a day to building your ASAs, at least 50% of your time should be on distribution. It should be on making content, uploading to YouTube, calls, DMing potential customers, actual distribution, not researching, not preparing, taking action, posting, uploading. Next up, focus on one channel. Do not do YouTube, Instagram, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, blah blah blah.

### 🚀 セクション 30

No, one channel could be called DM. Just do call DM. Could be just YouTube long firm. do just YouTube long firm could be a LinkedIn articles do just LinkedIn articles but choose one customer acquisition channel and master that channel it's significantly more different if you have if you're doing five different things on five different platforms each platform has a different algorithm each format is different not do all of them choose one master it stick with it and choose the one where your target avatar is located right so if you're trying to target lawyers probably don't make Tik Tok videos probably just do LinkedIn where your target avatar spends time on YouTube that's where you should be distributing ing and promoting. Next up, give value and not self-promo.

### ⚡ セクション 31

A lot of you guys when you get into distribution marketing, you make some content, you talk about your features, you talk about your product. Nobody cares about your product. Nobody knows your product exists. Okay? You need to give value.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Talk about biggest mistakes in your industry or how to, you know, how to tutorials or anything and then use your product in your videos. Don't do self-promo is like here's why my is that is the best or new feature in XY Z. Nobody cares about your app. Nobody cares about your features. Nobody knows you.

### 🎬 セクション 33

You need to give value. Make a valuable content that people genuinely get value from and then promote your software, your SAS. And this is more important than building. Like literally, if you just take this to heart, please realize that spending time on distribution should be done first. Your first 60 minutes of the day, if you're building an AI SAS, should be on distribution, creating content, trying to get customers.

### 📋 セクション 34

It's more important than building. And most of you are going to completely ignore this and you're just going to keep vibe coding with cloth. Few of you are going to listen to this and those are the people who are actually going to make money. Okay, next up, let's talk about deployments. Keep it super simple, guys.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Don't use containerized packages with Azure. Oh my god, so many of you are overengineering your deployments and you're building like big tech. You are not big tech. You're not making tens of billions of dollars per year. You are struggling to get customers.

### 📝 セクション 36

You are a startup. You need to move fast. So, keep it simple. Versel for the front end, render.com for the back end, Superbase for the database, Railway has a lot of great services. If you don't like Render or something, use Railway.

### 💡 セクション 37

And Hostinger has amazing VPS servers. If you want to use VPS for example with dock ploy or you just want to host anything on a server use hostinger. So these are the deployments. If you're over complicating it if you're using AWS like why do you have millions of customers? Do you have scalability issues?

### 🔧 セクション 38

Keep it simple guys. Don't overthink this or on a virgin. The simpler the better. It almost never is an issue that people choose on these platforms outscale it. If you do that's amazing problem you have great like you're 0.01% successful if you outscale any of these platforms.

### 🎯 セクション 39

But for most of you keep it simple. All right. Next up, we are going to talk about payments because without payments, you're not going to make any money. So, first of all, don't use stripe. Why?

### 💭 セクション 40

Even though Stripe is easy and proven blah blah blah, Stripe is not a merchant of record. So, I've I put three alternatives here. Polar, lemon squeezy, and parallel. These act as a merchant of record. So, let me explain this.

### 📌 セクション 41

And I made this mistake with vectal and it cost me like over a month of development cost to switch from stripe to Polar. But guys, just save yourself that time and don't make the same mistake as as me. You need to have merchant of records. What this means is that these companies, they legally own the transaction and handle all of the global tax compliance, VAT, GST filing, sales tax remittance across 150 plus different jurisdictions. If you're building a SAS, you're going to have customers from Europe, from South America, from North America, from Asia, maybe from Africa, but whatever.

### ✅ セクション 42

You get the point. You're going to have customers from 50 plus 100 plus countries. And each of these countries have different laws, different regulations, different uh, you know, VAT, all that stuff. You are going to drown in legal processes and in accounting if you want to do that manually, which you have to do manually if you're using Stripe. This is why you need a merchant of record.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, choose one of these three. These companies uh charge slightly higher fees than than Stripe, sometimes not even, and they integrate with Stripe, so it's easy to switch and they handle all of this for you. And you never have to worry about getting into trouble with German VAT tax because you are not on the customer's card. It is parallel squeezy or polar. So use merch of record.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Trust me, you're going to save yourself so much headache, so much pain. This is one of the most common mistakes that people make when building a SAS. Related to payments is pricing. So let's talk about pricing. There we go.

### 🎨 セクション 45

A lot of you are charging too little. That's simply the truth. you need to probably charge more and you need to keep your profit margins between 70 and 95%. Because otherwise you're going to get eaten by API costs. How do you charge more?

### 🚀 セクション 46

Well, you make a better offer. So, first of all, read this book from Alexi. Absolute bible of business. Takes like one or two days to read. Super concise, super distilled.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Just read it, okay? It's you got to find it online for free. He made this as cheap as possible. Next up, you need to, you know, once you improve your offer and you charge more, you want to sell to annual and two-year plans. Do not go for monthly plans right away, guys.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Let's say you you're charging $30 a month, right? Times 12, that would be 360. But obviously, the annual plan is some discount, so that could be 300. $300 a month allows you to do so much more. You can run paid ads.

### 🎬 セクション 49

If you run paid ads and it takes you $200 to acquire a customer, which in a lot of industries that would be realistic, then guess what? On day one, you're profiting 100. If for the same product you run paid ads, but you're going for monthly and it cost you $100 because it's the same product, it's going to cost you the same to acquire the customer and you're charging $30 a month. You're literally going to take four months to be profitable. That will make scaling way, way harder.

### 📋 セクション 50

And if you have high churn, you won't even get the customer for four months and you're going to lose money. So go with annual and two-year plans and make them more more appealing. Include personalized onboarding. If somebody buys an annual plan or two-year plan, just make the offer better and charge more money. Also, go high ticket possible.

### ⭐ セクション 51

A lot of people don't realize you can build high ticket software. You don't have to charge $10 a month, $20 a month. You are not JPD, okay? You're not going to reach 1 billion weekly active users. So go high ticket, target businesses, go B2B, solve a painful problem for rich people or wealthy companies and charge thousands of dollars for that.

### 📝 セクション 52

You can sell software that is still replicable and sellable to others. I'm not talking about building agency, guys. That's terrible. You shouldn't do like a one-off project. You want to keep building something that can scale that you can sell eventually for a lot of money like I did with Vectal.

### 💡 セクション 53

So you need to figure out what is something that I could sell to businesses or wealthy individuals that I can charge four figures for or even five figures for that I can resell to others. Maybe you do a license, you know, maybe you you give them an exclusivity only in their country or in or region, whatever, right? Get creative with it. Make the offerboard peeling and target B2B if possible. Don't just make a B2C product like everybody charging $20 a month.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's ruthless. It's very difficult and you're going to probably lose your hair. Now, all of this assumes that you already know AI coding. But if you're not into AI coding and you want to master it, make sure to join the new society. This is my community where I'm going to teach you everything you need to know about how to build software with AI.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Close code, codeex, cursor, everything is inside. If you join your society within two months, you're going to be an expert of AI coder. This is going to be linked below the video. Make sure to join. If you don't like it, we have a no question money back guarantee.

### 💭 セクション 56

So, literally just DM me. I'm going to refund your money. This is not my main source of income. Trust me. Next up, we have authentication.

### 📌 セクション 57

Where is it? There you go. Authentication right here. So with authentication, literally do not over complicate it, please. If you're using superbase for your database, just use superbase off.

### ✅ セクション 58

That's it. If you're not using superbase, use clerk, right? Clerk has everything you need. This is it. cleric.com with an e.

### 📚 セクション 59

It has u it's like more than authentication, you know, user management as well, but uh it has great authentication, lots of documentation for all different SDKs and text stacks. So yeah, Cleric is infinitely scalable. But if you want to keep it even simpler, just stick to superbase authentication. Don't over complicate this. If you're using AI for coding, you really don't want to risk having a complex authentication, right?

### 🔖 セクション 60

Because uh otherwise you're asking for security issues. Next essential thing that a lot of you are skipping is analytics. A lot of AI SAS people especially in the first 3 to six months have zero observability, zero analytics, zero product metrics, which is absolutely crazy because you cannot make datadriven decisions. Now, I know you might thinking, "Okay, David, like what is this data driven decisions? I'm not big tech." There is a reason this term exists.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Why? Because you use data to make rational and smart decisions. If you don't have any data, you don't know which feature to remove or keep. You don't know what product direction to take. You don't know what cohort of your audience you should target and market to.

### 🚀 セクション 62

You need data. You need analytics. So, here's three things, right? Post hog is for product metrics. So, you know, which features being used, where are people clicking, stuff like that.

### ⚡ セクション 63

session times, retention. Sentry is more for like errors and bugs. Um, so these two we use advoc as well. But if you want something LLM like observability of your AI agents and you know tokens, lang fuse is great. So these three for analytics, make sure to start tracking without any metrics, you cannot improve.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So if you want to lower your churn, you need to track it properly. If you want to improve session times, you need to measure them properly. And this is where analytics come into place. Next up, let's talk about prompt engineering and context engineering. A lot of your prompts suck completely.

### 🎬 セクション 65

you don't give the AI agents enough context and then your AI SAS is bad. Right? Now, let me debunk something. There's this concept of a LLM rapper. Like, oh, your app is just a rapper.

### 📋 セクション 66

Guys, there's going to be rappers and there already are rappers that are making millions and billions. If you make a rapper good enough for specific specific target avatar, you're going to print. Let me give you an example. in before even change video was released. I think it was like 20 22 23 uh people have built man I let me find the company name.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Okay, I found it. So this is called case text. They literally built a AI assistant for legal assistance before they got access to GBD4 before it was released. But basically this is a rapper. They took GBD4, made it relevant to legal assistant co- councils and sold to $650 million in cash.

### 📝 セクション 68

Right? So this is not equity. This is not some hypothetical uh stock options. This is cold hard cash in the bank account, right? So literally GBD4 and GBD4 is much worse than current models.

### 💡 セクション 69

And this is a rapper. It's a rapper and uh he got rich by building a rapper. So yeah, you can absolutely your ASASS is going to be some sort of a wrapper. Obviously, you probably want to have a custom UI and other features as well, but how good your wrapper depends on your prompts and your context engineering. So make sure to use XML tags at the beginning and at the end of different sections.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Make sure you have a agents.md file in the root of your codebase so that cloth code, open code, codeex, these agents are as good as possible. If you don't, you can just do the slashinit command in clo code or open code and it will generate the file for you because it will analyze your entire codebase and craft the file for you. But don't sleep on the importance of great problems. There's plenty of startups that have made a lot of money by taking popular AI models either from OpenAI and from Google and just making them highly optimized for a specific target avatar and making the best possible app for that avatar. lock in about your context engineering.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Don't sleep on this. It's very important. Next up, let's talk about operations when you're building, right? So, you need to be using some sort of task management, project management. If you have a big company, like you can use Jira and stuff like that, but for smaller companies, these three are better.

### 💭 セクション 72

So, linear is basically like a canv board for developers. They have a list view as well, but the list view is kind of bad. GitHub projects is super simple. So, if you're already using GitHub, you can just use the project inside of GitHub. That's what I used to do for a long time at Vectal.

### 📌 セクション 73

But then we added a vectoral ability to share your project. So obviously if you prefer like a simpler solution with built-in AI, then you can use vectal as well for your operations and task management. But you need to use something. You cannot just be yoloing actions one day at a time. You need to have a clear task list.

### ✅ セクション 74

You need to prioritize what features you add, what changes you make. So yeah, again, keep your operation simple. Use one of these three softwares. Now let's talk about the biggest mistakes. And this might be guys, I know we covered a lot, but this might be the most valuable part of the video.

### 📚 セクション 75

Biggest mistakes people make when building an ASAS. First of all, do not get married to your idea. You don't know if your idea is good until it prints you money. If it prints you money, your idea is good before. Then don't get married to it.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Don't get emotionally attached to it. Okay? You and your idea are not the same thing. If your idea sucks, that doesn't mean that you suck. You just had a bad idea.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Everybody had a bad idea in their life. Okay? So, don't get married to it. Next biggest mistake is only building and not promoting. I already touched on that, but a lot of you are literally doing it as you watch.

### 🚀 セクション 78

You are building something you think it's cool. You're not promoting it. You're not getting any real input from the market. You're you're going to learn a painful lesson sooner or later. Next biggest mistake is solving a problem others won't pay for.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Maybe that problem is is still like valuable. Maybe people use it for free, but are they willing to pay for it? If they're not willing to pay for it, you don't have a business on your hand. Next thing, oh my god, this is so common. Targeting everybody.

### 🌟 セクション 80

David, but my app could be used by anyone. Listen, dumbass. That's amazing in theory, but it's terrible in practice. You don't know how to do your marketing. You You cannot do clear copyrightiting.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Your landing page is going to be too broad and not specific enough. You don't know which features to add and which to remove because you're trying to target everybody. You are not GPT. You are not Google. Stop targeting everybody.

### 📋 セクション 82

Choose a clear target avatar. Go after a small niche and start there. If you dominate that small niche and if you create a monopoly there, you can expand. But before then, you are going to hurt yourself by trying to target everybody instead of going after a clear specific target avatar with a clear specific problem and solving that problem in a unique way better than everybody else. Next up, charging too liter.

### ⭐ セクション 83

We already talked about it. You should probably increase your prices. Next up, next biggest mistake is taking forever to release. Guys, the amount of entrepreneurs and startup founders I know that are permanently two weeks away from launching is is amazing. Like there's literally people who I catch up with like two times a year, three times a year.

### 📝 セクション 84

And anytime I ask them like, "Yo, how's your company doing? How's how's your startup going?" They're always two weeks away from launching. It's incredible. So if you are one of these people, you can realize like you need to set a deadline and you just need to launch. I don't care if there's going to be bugs.

### 💡 セクション 85

I don't care if there's missing features. You need to release your product. Okay? Release your startup. Get it to the market as fast as possible.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Otherwise, you might be building something that nobody wants. And the only way to know that is to release it to the market. Next up, choosing a dying market. Again, don't sell to newspapers. Don't sell to, you know, elevator operators.

### 🎯 セクション 87

I mean, that's non-existent market, but it used to be existing market 100 years ago, but it doesn't exist anymore. So, make sure that whatever you're doing, you are in a growing industry, in a growing market, right? Very simple. But a lot of you again are selling to a dying market, which makes it much harder to grow. Next up, not using AI to learn.

### 💭 セクション 88

You can use AI obviously to build your code and that's the obvious thing that everybody's doing. But the best way to use AI is to improve yourself, is to speed up your learning, is to ask precise questions, do deep research and learn faster and become smarter and more competent yourself so that you can use the AI agents even more. And you have two exponentials, right? One exponential is AI getting better and better. And the second is your skill sets and your knowledge and your technical capability getting better and better and they compound.

### 📌 セクション 89

So if you do both, you're going to absolutely crush 2026. then overspending API cost. Again, don't um don't underestimate this, you know. Um if you have an app where you have generous limits, people can quickly spend a lot of money on your AI models. If you use expensive models like Opus, you need to monitor your costs very closely.

### ✅ セクション 90

So, make sure you keep your margins above 50%, ideally above 70% for your ASAs. Otherwise, you're probably overspending on API calls and you need to change the offer or improve it in some way or implement some cheaper models somewhere where you don't need the full capability. And next up, which all of you make and this is everybody will be guilty of this is feature bloat. MVP stands for minimal viable product. But a better term I like to use is a quick and dirty prototype.

### 📚 セクション 91

If your quick and dirty prototype has seven features, congratulations, you've overbloated it and you have feature blo. You need one or two features. That's it. If you have one or two features and they're good and you're going to launch, you're going to make money. If you have 20 features, you're not going to make 20 great features.

### 🔖 セクション 92

It's already hard to make one great feature. Imagine 20. You're not going to do it. Avoid feature bloat. Most of features you have in your app right now are feature bloat and they should be removed.

### 🎨 セクション 93

And it's very painful. The first time I realized that at Vectal, I was sick. I couldn't sleep for like two days. But then I deleted like 70% of the features and literally none none of the customers complained. So yeah, feature bloat is one of the biggest mistakes as well.

### 🚀 セクション 94

And honestly, I'm probably leaving some stuff out, but these are the biggest mistakes that I see consistently from people when they try to build their first ASS. Now, let's talk about testers because if you don't have testers, u good luck. You're going to have a lot of mistakes. You're going to have bugs and u yeah, it's much easier to build when you have testers. So, first of all, when you're starting, you need to get resourceful, right?

### ⚡ セクション 95

It's one of the main skills of being an entrepreneur. Resourcefulness. If you don't have a lot of resources, you need to be resourceful. So your family could be testers. Your friends could be testers.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Your potential customers aka people who are your target avatar but aren't your customers. Those are amazing testers. You can do both technical and non techchnical to see, you know, how people use your app and where they get stuck. But the best thing is watch them in person. Don't just send them your app as a link.

### 🎬 セクション 97

No, sit them down, put a laptop in front of them and watch them use it for the first time in person. This will give you priceless advice. It will show you where they get confused. It will show you what features are missing. It'll show you, you know, maybe the onboarding is too long, maybe something is like overly complicated.

### 📋 セクション 98

Yeah, it'll just show you a lot. You should do this. You should figure out how to do this every single week if you can. But yeah, you need testers before you release production. Otherwise, you're going to have a a lot of sleepless nights just fixing production bugs.

### ⭐ セクション 99

So, make sure you have some testers. Next up, let's talk about terminal commands. Now, honestly, out of all of these, the only one you need is cloth. If you know how to use cloth code, and if you have cloud code installed, then you don't really have to interact with terminal that much. But if you're going to learn terminal commands, learn these.

### 📝 セクション 100

PWD, this shows you your um directory where it is located on your machine. LS shows you the list out files in this directory. CD, you can cd into a subdirectory or a directory. Basically, it's just changing where you are. Git add this is how you stage files.

### 💡 セクション 101

Git commit is how you do a commit and get push is you push to remote such as to GitHub. Then npm install is node package manager installs the dependencies. npm rundev runs the dev server. npm run build does a build uh production build. Git pull is how you pull updates on a branch.

### 🔧 セクション 102

So when maybe somebody else is working there. But again all of these you're going to solve with AI. But you shouldn't be scared of the terminal. Okay? Like you should shouldn't turn into this guy either, but like you shouldn't be scared of the terminal.

### 🎯 セクション 103

A lot of you guys think that terminal is like some mythical thing. It's not. If you learn how to use the terminal, you can move way faster. And again, this this is like less than 10 commands and this is really all you need. Like you don't need to learn hundreds of commands.

### 💭 セクション 104

Just learn the basic ones, understand what they do, and that's it. Like stop being afraid of the terminal. It's a limiting belief and it's a limiting your potential and you're going to make less money if you fear the terminal. Now, I don't know the last category, so I named it others because there's a bunch of different tips. But first of all, fair gates for onboarding is a great tool.

### 📌 セクション 105

If you don't have onboarding in your app, you're kind of trolling. Now, this just makes it onboarding easier. Obviously, you can build your own custom stuff, but you know, when people come into your app, it's it's going to show these like pop-ups next to features and yeah, it just makes onboarding easier easier. So, if you want, you can ask lot code and it will probably do it in a single prompt. But if you want something more pre-built, frigate is cool for that.

### ✅ セクション 106

Also, keep your landing page simple. Do not um over complicate it. Clearly explain what problem you're solving. Don't make it too long, okay? Make it easy to sign up.

### 📚 セクション 107

Put your sign up in the top right. Okay, guys. Don't put login and like don't don't try any esoteric layouts on the landing page. People expect to create an account in the top right. People expect the login to be in the top right.

### 🔖 セクション 108

So please put it there top right in the banner always visible. Next up, your onboarding should be quick. It shouldn't take 10 minutes to onboard. People want to get into the app. So do the most essential things.

### 🎨 セクション 109

And again, the best onboarding is them using the app. If you use Frigate, you can just have people use the app and click through it and get onboarded as they use the app instead of having to fill out questionnaire for 20 minutes and then they're annoyed at you and a lot of people are not going to even fill it out and you're going to be losing users. So, keep the onboarding quick and onboard people gradually. Also, make the plans upgrades easy. If you already have some free users and they're not converting, it's probably too difficult to upgrade.

### 🚀 セクション 110

So, a free user should always have a banner at the top where they can upgrade with one click. There should be some features that are only available on the paid plan. Again, next to those features should be an upgrade button. Make it easy for people to upgrade. Also, create a terms of service and privacy privacy policy.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Super simple. You can do it with AI. I'm not your legal advisor. Okay? This is not legal advice.

### 🌟 セクション 112

So, definitely buy a lawyer. Do not use AI for this, you know. Don't use AI for this. Pay a professional lawyer. But no matter what you do, make sure you have terms of service and privacy policy.

### 🎬 セクション 113

It's just sloppy not having it. You know, you need to have it legally. Next up, Stripe Atlas. If you want to set up a LLC, use Stripe Atlas to set it up. But if you don't have any paying customers and you have no users and no motion and no business experience, then probably that shouldn't be your first step.

### 📋 セクション 114

Again, I'm not your lawyer. Uh this is not legal advice. But if you do want to set up a LLC, Stripe Atlas makes it super easy. No matter where you live, you don't even have to go to the USA. It's uh the easiest way to start an LLC.

### ⭐ セクション 115

So yeah, this has been everything you need to know to build an AI SAS in 2026. So hopefully you found this video valuable. If you did, make sure to subscribe. And if you want to actually turn this into real business model, make sure to join your society. In there, I show you everything you need to know about AI coding and how to actually go from an idea to a fully monetized AI SAS.

### 📝 セクション 116

The new society also gives you access to a community of 400 other people at the cutting edge of AI. You get weekly calls with AI experts. You get a classroom full of materials, copy pasteable prompts, templates, stuff that you can plug and play into your company right away. And if you actually watch these modules, you're going to go from a complete beginner with AI coding to someone who's better than 99% of people at building stuff with AI. So, join the new society.
