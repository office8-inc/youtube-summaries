## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This typo cost companies over $150 million. On February 28, 2017, at 9:37 a.m., an Amazon Web Services engineer executed a command that removed servers for an S3 billing subsystem. S3 lets applications store things like files, photos, or videos. The billing subsystem would process the analytics for customers using S3. Now, a reminder that S3 is used by millions of companies worldwide.

### 📋 背景・概要

However, somewhere in that command, a typo was inserted and it took down way more servers than intended. Almost immediately, S3 was unable to handle any requests. It required a full restart. Slack, Docker, Expedia, credit unions, and more were all down because of this outage. Hours and hours go by without any update whatsoever because even their service health dashboard depended on Amazon S3.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

3 hours later at 12:26 p.m. their index subsystem recovers enough capacity to handle the critical requests while service came back about an hour and a half later. And it's estimated that roughly this outage cost companies over $150 million. So next time you panic over a typo that you sent in your last email, well at least it's not $150 million. Fall for more.
