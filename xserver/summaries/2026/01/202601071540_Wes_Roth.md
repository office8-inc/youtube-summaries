## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

If somebody hacks my computer, they can probably come up with a medicine and kill me tomorrow. They'll just spray something in my house and I'm dead, right? For people that ever wonder what it's like living through an industrial revolution when the internet first became a thing. You know, when fire was discovered, this is what it feels like. Why did the for founding fathers of America say like everybody can have a a gun is because they were like we want to have a force as citizens that sort of matches the government force.

### 📋 背景・概要

But I guess the current equivalent of that is like everybody needs to have these very powerful tools for shaping the future, not just >> a few people dictating it. So yeah, >> protect your right to bear AI. AI should make a shirt. >> That's your next shirt, Wes. Right now.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Go on your merch store and make that sucker right now. >> We're on it. We're on it. >> The boys use some naughty naughty language in this one. You've been warned.

### 📝 詳細説明

>> Leave all my stupid words and I say I don't give a Yeah. Yeah. This is going to be the This is the open click right on it. It's like I don't give an F. Like it's like okay, it's going to be quite the interview.

### 💡 実例・デモ

He had everything. >> Yeah, we went into some stuff. I was like, "Okay, this is going to get me banned off of YouTube." We got a chance to talk to Fzad. He's a big presence in this YouTube tech space. He does a lot of great coverage on Tesla, Elon Musk.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

He also tends to get into these random discussions with Elon on X. So today we're going to be talking about those discussions if we're going to need UBI or even a universal high income UHI as well as what's going to happen as more automation takes over. And towards the end we also dive into some more personal stuff that I don't think we've ever talked about before. I hope you enjoy it. Yeah, I'm Farzad.

### 🎯 応用例

I'm a content creator. I used to work at Tesla for 4 years. I have an experience uh a lot of experience in business intelligence, but now I make content cuz it's really fun and I can't stop and that's why I'm doing this. I'm literally addicted. Hi, nice to meet you.

### 💭 考察

>> Absolutely incredible. Thank you so much for being here. Interestingly, as we're recording this, actually, you've posted some information about you working with Claude Code, I believe, and um doing some genetic uh you know, uploading your genetic testing and stuff like that, which I've been meaning to do that for a while. I've done that with my blood work, and I've been meaning to get, you know, my the full sequence and then upload it because I've heard good things about it. But you posted your results and uh Elon answered.

### 📌 まとめ

So let's I mean maybe let's start there. Tell us a little bit about that. >> Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So claude code for me just to give a background to everybody.

### ✅ 結論

I'm I'm not really a coder by design. So I I've used SQL extensively in my in my career, but SQL is not really coding. You know, like if you tell a coder I know how to write in SQL, they'll be like, okay, you know, whatever. Who cares, right? That's nothing.

### 📚 追加情報

Like you're trying to show off, you know, I'm like I know how to use SQL. Um the the one thing that I've always taken an interest in, so I have a math background, a statistics background. Um you know, I the way I think, the way I sort of do processes, the way I work lends itself really nicely to coding. That's been one of the things that I've learned about myself, one of my strengths in the past. And now with this sort of AI stuff going on and me tinkering with claw code, I've been using Replet for a long time.

### 🔖 補足

time. So, Replet's one of those like, you know, I call it like a like a newbie claude code type tool that is much more visual and it kind of helps people like me who are laymans when they come it comes to coding. But one of the things I really wanted to do, you know, I saw Carpathy's post on X which kind of set the world on fire about claw code and all that stuff. Uh I was like, okay, I'm actually going to give it a shot because I' I've seen all the people talk about it before. This is not new.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Like we've we're trying to build a lot of tools for for my business, the media company using AI. We're using Replet to basically build a creator OS for the back end for everything that I do. You know, come up with ideas, uh create scripts, titles, thumbnails, ideation, curation, research, everything in in one tool. And um but it has its limits, right? It has its limits.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So I'm like, okay, so let me let me try clawed code. And then one of the things that about claw code that I didn't really realize and I started using it is and I saw somebody mention this on X2, it can literally act as an assistant. you can just have it do stuff for you on the computer that you wouldn't normally do. And somebody on X was like, you know, I gave it my genetic code. I gave it my genetic uh information.

### ⚡ セクション 15

I gave it, you know, my blood work information and it seemed to work really well for me. So, I did the same exact thing and I was like, "Holy shit." like it it came up with a it it one of the cool things about about claw code at least from my experience and I don't know if this is me just being a noob or if it's a fact the way claude code can parse through really large files seems like a unique ability because it sort of chunks them out into different into different and I don't know if that's a cla code thing or that's just like a non- chatgpt non Grock nonclaw AI thing but that actually allows the tool to go through ginormous files and then help put everything together. And so if you give it that plus your blood work information, I gave it, you know, I had a plaque scan of my of my arteries and my keratid and my heart and everything. They were all clear. Threw it all in there.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I gave it my supplement routine. I gave it I'm giving it my Apple health data. If somebody hacks my computer, they can probably come up with a medicine and kill me tomorrow. They'll just spray something in my house and I'm dead, right? >> Yeah.

### 🎬 セクション 17

>> They'll do anything. But but the type of insights I was able to get from that like, "Oh, hey, the B12 uh supplement you're taking actually your genes can't process that correctly. You should be taking this kind of B12 supplement." Oh, hey, the the the omega-3 uh pill you're taking is actually plant-based. Your genes can't process plant-based omega-3s at all. You should be taking fish oil instead.

### 📋 セクション 18

And a bunch of other stuff. Hey, you're the warrior type brain, which means that you clear dopamine really fast, but if you take a lot of caffeine, that's going to give you anxiety. Oh, wow. I wonder why I got a panic attack the one time I took pre-workout which landed me in the hospital. So like so many things are starting to like click for me just using this tool for the last couple days as a personal assistant and then that has opened the floodgates for me to be like holy [ __ ] like like we're not that far away.

### ⭐ セクション 19

You know, I imagine if Apple just had a terminal in in in Mac OS that acted like claw code and it was able to just access everything in in iCloud in the in the Mac OS ecosystem and it just does stuff for me on my behalf, right? That's not that far away. And sort of sort of claw code sort of opened my eyes to that. But that cloud code is such a small piece of the puzzle. You know, you got freaking robot taxes with Tesla.

### 📝 セクション 20

You got human robots down the pike. You got all these LLM out in the wild. have all these different tools that are being created with AI. It's just it just, you know, for people that ever wonder what it's like living through an industrial revolution, you know, like the the the first and the second one when the internet first became a thing, you know, when fire was discovered. This is what it feels like.

### 💡 セクション 21

I my sort of my newbie take on this and it just has me so unbelievably fired up. I feel so grateful to be in this situation where I can get lost in these tools. I can literally just get lost in them for hours and hours and days and weeks. And it's obvious that for for the people that actually want to spend time learning and using these tools, they will be unbelievably successful, but also unbelievably valuable to society because it unlocks all these brains with their ideas and their and the things they want to create that could have never done it before because they didn't know how to code or they didn't know how to use technology. They just had the ideas.

### 🔧 セクション 22

But now that you have these super assistants, they'll do that work for you. >> It's it's unbelievable. It's just such an unbelievable time, >> dude. And you have to think too, like right now it seems like everything sort of digital and encode, but it'll eventually move into the real world where there's manufacturing and robotics and 3D printing. So ideas still right now I can't, you know, go build an actual object.

### 🎯 セクション 23

I don't know how to do that with those skills, but once robotics and AI hit that same thing, >> it's going to be crazy. It' be wild. >> What do you think for the next sort of five years? I mean, do you some some people kind of predict the AI gets more into the background, kind of quiets itself, so you don't interact with it as much, but it's more around it's somehow kind of in your router and in your refrigerator and then it gives you just like one simple humanlike interface or do you kind of see it being all around and a bunch of narrow tools and some people use it for genes in certain ways that are very specific and narrow? >> Yeah, I think it's both.

### 💭 セクション 24

I mean, I think I think for the next 5 years, you know, this is sort of my, you know, this not gospel, but I still think for the next 5 to 20 years, we're still going to have a lot of development of of like how to actually use AI. I think we'll get into like more like like a master AI where it kind of has like 80 to 95% of what you would want to do in your life and it's sort of like uh ultraconnected between all the devices, right? and and but that by that to me I feel like we have to go through the phase of everybody getting in the same page and allowing these AIs to kind of get into the into those products or physical things that exist. Um but one of the you know if I think about Musk industry as an example the the marriage between Grock and Tesla has already sort of started where now you're creating this sort of ecosystem where your Tesla vehicle will carry over all your conversations that you had in Grock to your browser or your phone. So that's a baby version of that, but for that to proliferate all the way in the next five years, that feels very fast to me.

### 📌 セクション 25

But in the next 20 for sure, and it's just I think it's a matter of like which and I would love to get your guys' take on this cuz I you know I'm probably very wrong on this, but it almost feels like the the company that has the multimodal model like the really the world model that can really understand everything sort of video, audio, text, everything like and it has really good sort of reasoning. I think that company will stand to actually win in that, right? And it's not even maybe creating their own physical products, but partnering with companies, plugging into their brain that are enabled by that brain, right? So, we all we all see how Apple doesn't want to build their own freaking AI because they don't don't have the talent. They want to partner with Google or whoever or Chat GPT and that that's going to be their brain.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, I think I think for that to happen all across the economy and all all the products and everything, that's going to take a while. But you know like your XIS and your anthropics to me I mean who knows who knows who's going to win. Who knows who's going to win long term but that's how I view it. That's a very long answer to your question but I still think for the next 5 years it's going to be a lot of exploration. It's just going to be a you know I I find it hard to believe that the next 5 years is going to be the end result of AI.

### 📚 セクション 27

So like if you think about the internet from its creation to where we are today. It took a long time for us to get where we are today. Took about 20 30 years. however gamechanging the technology was from like like starting being adopted by the sort of like the hardcore tech people the early adopters to where we are today I think AI is going to follow the same path it's just the the asmtote the the acceleration of the technology is just so much faster but also the the the potential is so much higher right so it's just going to feel like this the whole time but we're going to be on this rocket ship for 20 years you know that's what it feels like to me >> definitely and I mean Elon has recently tweeted like we're entering the singularities So that kind of like a vertical straight up movement like we're slowly like entering that era. Um and I think you're absolutely right about the idea of multiple multimodal models or combinations of models world models.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Actually, Deis Hassabus recently was saying pretty much the same thing that once all their models come together for, you know, the video models, the the dreaming models, the what was it called? The Genie, all of that stuff plus Gemini, you know, right now their image generation models. It's running off of the back of Gemini. So, Gemini is kind of the base layer on which everything's being built. So, he's saying once all those pieces are in place, that will be kind of the protoagi, kind of like that beginning.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, it's the combination of everything. And it's so interesting because with a lot of this stuff, I feel like Elon, if you follow him, you listen to what he's saying, he'll say stuff like years before everybody else catches on. So he's always thinking like a few steps ahead. So he already said what the final models will be. It will be photons in and photons out.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So if he So we're just trying to figure out like what it's going to be in the next 5 10 years. He's like, "Okay, but in 20 years or whenever this is going to be like the final sort of >> Yeah. >> It's it's it's absolutely incredible." And um also I mean he's you know Google is thinking about putting these data centers in space um to to train and do all that stuff and use solar energy and they're kind of I read the paper in the paper they're kind of looking at SpaceX as the company that's going to unlock that ability. They're saying as long as they continue progressing the way they are we'll get there by 2035 which is which is pretty nuts. Um, one other very interesting thing I wanted to talk to you about, maybe we can kind of dive into this because there's I want to talk to you more about the the health findings.

### ⚡ セクション 31

I want to talk to you about the warrior type and the was it the MTHFR mutation that that it said you had. Do you remember? >> Yeah. I think I think that's it. Yeah.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Yeah. Yeah. >> We got to dive into that. Okay. I have Sorry, I have a note here.

### 🎬 セクション 33

But um >> uh but anyways, let's talk about the the whole idea of automation job replacement um universal basic income. You of course argued with um Elon for a little bit. Uh um Patel, Dwarkesh Patel recently had his blog post about it or his expost about it. I mean, let's dive in. What do you think about that whole thing?

### 📋 セクション 34

Are we going need UBI or or the big version of it, the high income? What do you think? Yeah, I mean it's a it's a very complex conversation that is like it's very hard to think through because it's so difficult to imagine a world where everybody has access to everything right but I still think there's going to be some limitations around finite things around things that have actual you know scarcity and so the one the one thought experiment I went through on that video was like okay and that was sort of like the argument I call the argument you know it's just you know the title is great you know it's good for the title to I got an argument with Elon Musk, right? Elon Musk. There you go.

### ⭐ セクション 35

>> Elon Musk is an idiot. I showed him up. You know, I would never do that. But, uh, the, um, the the thought experiment there is like, okay, so let's say everybody has is able to, you know, has access to everything and they can have whatever they want. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 36

Who gets to who gets Malibu? Who gets, you know, the most prime real estate in San Francisco? Who gets the most prime real estate in Florida or Texas? Who gets that? Right?

### 💡 セクション 37

If everybody if everybody has infinite money, how do we duke out for that thing? And then, you know, the counterargument is like, well, okay, just we'll just make more Malibu. We'll make more New Yorks. We'll make more more Florida or whatever. Like, yeah, maybe, maybe we do that in like 100, 200, 500 years.

### 🔧 セクション 38

But what if somebody really wants the original Malibu? And what if they want a 100 acres to themselves around the original Malibu? How do we figure that out? Because people, you know, we have eight billion people in the world and human nature is human nature, right? That's sort of that's that's the aspect that I that I like to go down.

### 🎯 セクション 39

It's like it's like just because everybody has access to everything doesn't mean that people will still want things. You have you have extremely wealthy people that still seek power, that still seek sex, that still seek uh unbelievably expensive things just because they want it. It's like they don't even need it. How do we figure that out? And that's where it becomes a really fascinating thought experiment because the the the dynamics of how humans will sort of interact with each other in that world are still going to remain.

### 💭 セクション 40

The question becomes where is the floor? Like what what does the floor look like? Okay. So if the floor is well you just don't get Malibu but you'll get a really nice place versus where you are today. It's like okay cool.

### 📌 セクション 41

That's that could work. But how does that work relative to the top? because that's that's what creates friction in a society. It's not so much look at where the floor is now and compared to a 100 years ago. It's how am I performing versus the top, right?

### ✅ セクション 42

And so if the top can have all the nice places to themselves because they have the army of human or robots to keep everybody else out, that's going to be a problem. That's going to be a problem. And they have the army to make their own things. That's going to be a problem. So, right.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, so how do we democratize and distribute the power that comes from artificial intelligence systems, right? How does how does that get decided? What is the role of governments? What is the role of society? What is the the role of democracy?

### 🔖 セクション 44

How like these are all the open questions. Even in a UBI, UHI society, human nature is going to still drive a lot of a lot of uh a lot of action and a lot of like tendencies for how humans behave. So, um, but I I don't know. Like I think I I do think the like where I'm at, I do think that there is going to be a uh like AI is going to create unbelievable opportunity for a lot of people. I think it is going to make a lot of people's lives better.

### 🎨 セクション 45

I really do think so. But I don't think it's going to be a magic bullet. I don't think it's going to solve for human nature. I don't think it's going to solve for power and sort of these power dynamics and and scarce resources. I think if anything the fight for scarce resources will probably intensify because then the value of a scarce resource goes up as everything else that is not scarce goes down.

### 🚀 セクション 46

The relative value increases. And so as you have non-scarce things that can enable you to get scarce things, the ones that have access to the non-scarce things will try to get the scarce things faster, stronger. That's the way I view it. And so we might get this dynamic where maybe we have wars around Malibu 24/7, right? >> Armies clashing.

### ⚡ セクション 47

>> Yeah. I don't know. So it's like it's just a fascinating, you know, and is that going to happen in the next 5 years? Of course not. Like are we going to get a boom in the next 5 to 20 years?

### 🌟 セクション 48

Yes. Are people going to get displaced because of that boom? Of course. That's what happened during the industrial revolution. You know, that's what happened with a lot of technologies that happened.

### 🎬 セクション 49

But also as that technology was birthed, it also opened up the economy for everybody to leverage that technology to create new things. So the printing press transformed the world, right? The internet transformed the world. The industrial revolution, the manufacturing process, manufacturing line transformed the world, you know, it's it's just um but it's not a magic bullet. It's not a magic bullet, I don't think.

### 📋 セクション 50

What What do you guys think? I would love to hear your your guys' take on this. >> And Dylan, I do really want to hear your take. Uh, I just wanted to follow up really fast with Farzad because one of the I'm always like asking people like who are the greatest thinkers in this space that are talking about this kind of transition to a post- labor economy. One of the articles that I've read that really resonated with me.

### ⭐ セクション 51

I'm saying it's right. I'm not saying it's perfect, but um it was actually from OpenAI. Sam Alman uh was on there, Elia Sutsker was on there. A lot of the I think Daario was on there as well. way back from the early days, they kind of put together a little thing about kind of how to approach thinking about this transition to this new economy.

### 📝 セクション 52

And so there were a couple tenants that that there that I think addressed it. One is, you know, if you think about it, there's only going to be a few things that are scarce. Land, like you said. Number one and number two, you know, companies that are very, very successful. Those are like the two sort of scarce resources, right?

### 💡 セクション 53

Because you can build anything anywhere. So just buildings in of themselves won't be scarce. assuming you have the robotic power to build it. But the land, like you said, Malibu, coastal properties, whatever, that's going to be the scarce resource. So he's saying, get rid of the income tax, get rid of old taxes, just tax those scarce resources.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So a land task tax and a corporation tax for corporations above a certain size, use that money to provide that universal high income. Um, and the other thing that he not that he noted that I thought was very that I think a lot of people miss is that if you think about it, like if you're in the bottom 10% of the income, um, you know, and you make $10 a month and you know, your bills are $11 a month, right? Or 10, whatever. You're barely making ends meet and they print a bunch more money. You're poorer.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Like the bottom 10% is effectively much, much worse off. Uh, the top 10%, they don't care, right? Cuz they can afford anything, right? the food goes up 20%, they're like, "We don't care." But with automation, if we're reducing how much everything costs, right? Because that human labor component is the biggest thing, right?

### 💭 セクション 56

If we reduce that and all the prices drop on everything on on healthcare, on food, on education, I mean, the bottom 10% are like the ones that are the most improved by that. Um, and so that's one thing that he's pointing out that that this thing if we can provide that floor like you were saying like the it's not that we're going to have to pay $10,000 to every single person uh every month. The automation will drop the prices just like Mo's law drop the prices of uh the the conductors. Um this will drop the price of basically like everything. In fact, that blog post was called Moore's law for everything.

### 📌 セクション 57

Yeah. >> Uh what do you think that kind of maybe uh answers some of your concerns about what you mentioned or do you still think we're going to like what do you think about that? I guess let me let me get opened. >> I would I would push back on the first point because it's like I I think the like even if we tax like let's let's say that people who own the scarce resources get taxed. Uh how will others compete for the thing that they own?

### ✅ セクション 58

Like like is that just going to get locked away? Right? Like I'm trying to think about the mechanism of the transaction that could occur where like let's say somebody has an ambition to live in Malibu. What is the mechanism to live in Malibu? What is the mechanism to have the thing that you want right today?

### 📚 セクション 59

If I want to live on in Malibu, I have to spend I don't know in like a really nice uh beach like you know like beachfront property. I don't know $30 million. I don't even know what the number is. And I have to pay taxes out the ass. Okay.

### 🔖 セクション 60

But at least there's a mechanism for me to do that. But in the age of like of like you know if nobody has money okay so so h how do we decide who even if I have to pay a lot of taxes what is the mechanism for me to transact with the person who lives in Malibu do I have to like do we like what do we trade that that's that's where I'm like you know if money is sort of worthless in an age where products and services are unlimited what is the transaction what is the unit of transaction that we use so that if you know say Elon lives on Malibu and that he has his his compound there and I'm like, you know what, that'd be nice for me. I'm going to give you an offer that you can't refuse. What is that offer? I'll give you a Death Star.

### 🎨 セクション 61

>> What is that? >> Yeah. So, you know, >> Yeah. The way I was going to take the direction was more in enforce like I think about a lot how how would enforcement work? Because, >> you know, it's not from a society point of view there.

### 🚀 セクション 62

It's not like a bunch of people who have weapons in their home are going to stop a bunch of robots from like walking in if they want. So, if an AI in the future says, "Hey, you have this Malibu home, but I'm not really into the concept of money, and I'm thinking I'm going to destroy this and I'm going to build a a huge tower and a thousand people can all live in it." Um, and you know, from the greater good of society, now a thousand people get to live in Malibu instead of just you in your house. Like, first off, do you have the right? Like, is it the government that makes those kind of rights? And then if so, does the government have their own robots that enforce that or does somebody who owns the robots enforce that?

### ⚡ セクション 63

or in some cases are the robots out there acting fairly autonomously and somebody else just said make me money and isn't quite sure about this strategy and the robots are out there doing their own thing too. So yeah, just that idea of enforcement even if it even if you bring it all the way down to your own life and say, "Hey, I want to be healthier and how much how much do I want to let you sort of enforce this?" Like does my fridge not open up when you know I'm going for candy or does it only open up when I'm eating healthy or or do I do you guide me but I don't listen to you? You know, it's like the whole thing is so different. It's such a different concept to think about enforcement when it's not the the same legal system and monetary system that we have now. >> Yeah, that's a great point.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Yeah, >> I I think we're still going to have money cuz I mean, even if you know, just if there's a bunch of AI agents that are running all these corporations, I mean, there still needs to be some sort of currency, some sort of an exchange method. I guess I'm thinking of it more as 90% of the people will no longer have to think about money. Uh in a sense that you know they're given a certain amount of money every month that is 10x what they need to cover their basic necessities because everything's so cheap. I'm more thinking of it from like really push down the pricing of everything and then people just don't care. It's like just play money.

### 🎬 セクション 65

You know what I mean? Now can you accumulate uh millions and then or billions or whatever and then then buy the Malow property? Yes. But then you do still engage in businesses. You still build businesses.

### 📋 セクション 66

You still try to drive innovation. Or another approach and this is something that we talked to the founders of um Bench of Vending Bench two very smart guys um and I kind of asked them the same questions like how do you think about it? one Lucas one of them one of the concerns that he gave he said a lot of nations that don't require human labor even right now they tend to not be very nice to the population and he kind of gives as an example um nations that produce a lot of oil so because they have uh uh the money coming from oil they don't necessarily need to keep the population happy and so some often not all the time of course there's a you know counter examples but it seems to be like if the government doesn't need the people then it might be a little bit abusive. So he's also saying like if AI creates that same dynamic that's something that we should think about. A potential solution might be to have everyone if you're human you get some portion of the compute that you can vote you can give it to the government you can give it to some charity right?

### ⭐ セクション 67

You know what I mean? So if you're a human you by birthright you have some access and that way the governments can't just abuse it cuz they're like oh we better not make them mad. Um, same thing like maybe people can give it to companies that they like or people that produce great works of art or great whatever and you know what I mean that could be a form of currency. I don't know something like that. >> Yeah, I think I think all those are super interesting points.

### 📝 セクション 68

I I do think like if I take the the optimistic angle of this is like if you and I mean you guys tell me if if I'm barking up the right tree here or not but it does seem like as the arc of time has progressed and as humanity has uh sort of evolved and developed uh technological capability so like the better we've become at technology technology has a sort of like uh distributes and democratizes itself and then so what we've had this effect where we've gone from uh a few rulers or a few people who build a future to many people that now quote unquote build a future. And the people that build the future are entrepreneurs. They are creators, right? It's like the three of us on this podcast, weirdly enough, we are building the future by having conversations about the future. But if you if you go back in time 1500 years ago or a thousand years ago, building the future was only really saved for the ruling classes like the monarchs and the rulers and the dictators and like the the the tribes leaders and everybody just have to follow suit.

### 💡 セクション 69

Whereas in today's land and and sort of like what what a AI the effect that AI has so far which is a phenomenal phen phenomenal one because there's competition is that every AI company is democratizing the rules by default because they want to win and if they want to win they have to lower the highest quality lowest cost product or service and and what that does it then gives more and more people access to those technologies to build things to create things and so like that angle that angle is a positive one and so as long as as long as we can keep that dynamic so like the question becomes you know once AGI or ASI emerges in however form that emerges does that have a ultra competitive effect or does it have a winner take all effect if it has an winner take all effect there's going to be a forcing function for the bad scenario which is the literal like everything gets sort of we get we get into the you have to know somebody to be able to live in Malibu or to influence what happens in Malibu, you'll just have to kind of like monarchs like you have to be born into the system or you have to be adopted by the system, right? Sort of. But if it has this effect where no, now we have potentially a 100 million people because they have the drive, because they have the will, because they want to be creators and builders, they get to build a future. And then then that competition creates a sort of environment and a and a uh like a a game like capitalism is a game, right? It's a game where people can take part of to sort of fight for Malibu because Malibu right now is reserved for the top 1% of the maybe.1% of the population, maybe less.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Only those people can play the game of I want to live in Malibu. But at least there's a game and at least there's access to get into the game. You know, all three of us can do 10 podcasts a day for 100 years and then maybe we can have 10% of what we need to live in Malibu, right? But at least there's a game. So, it's there's just and and this is sort of the the very exciting part about this whole thing is like at least the trend so far, you know, and I've gone back and forth on this so many times where it's like sometimes I take a very optimistic view or a pessimistic view on AI, but as of late, I've become unbelievably optimistic because I I have under, you know, the whole talk of the AI bubble, AI bubble, AI bubble.

### 🎯 セクション 71

The more I use this tools, the more I'm like, no, people have no idea what they're talking about. There is a reason why these companies are going so much in debt to build this these compute clusters. It's because it's [ __ ] crazy. >> That's a good thing. And so if we can keep that trend moving forward, it is much more likely that we'll have an ultra positive outcome because you will maximize the number of people that will marry their natural talents and their natural drive to a tool or an AI or whatever that will actually bring that forward and benefit them from a spiritual and fulfillment level and benefit society because society actually gets to experience that person's unique song or their unique talent or the unique ability.

### 💭 セクション 72

that that's the trend we're on right now. >> Okay. >> So, so let me ask you a kind of a question in that realm. So, I want to kind of pick your brain about how much credit and value should be assigned to AI or to the person prompting it in different scenarios. So, >> in a current situation, if you had this good idea, you could spend a little bit of money to create an LLC.

### 📌 セクション 73

You could hire a person for $30 an hour maybe to go execute on the idea. and assuming that they made a lot of value. Let's say this idea makes a million dollars. You're the owner. As long as they get paid fairly what they were agreed and you pay your, you know, taxes on this LLC, like you get that huge benefit, right?

### ✅ セクション 74

You get all of the upside and it it's unlimited. You can become a trillionaire. Um, with AI, you pay for a compute cluster to process it and you sign up with your account. You prompt it correctly. Do you think that all of the value that would come from that prompt if it was hundreds of millions of dollars deserves to be yours?

### 📚 セクション 75

Or do you think you need to have uh clear understanding of what it did to society to make that money before you earn that money? Or do you think at a certain point some of it should go towards taxes or to lower income people? Where do you think AI knowledge and intelligence ends in terms of your benefit? Yeah, I mean I think I think in the in the current world I view it through the same systems we've had today which where right now AI is a tool and the the tool is being there's a competition for the tool of choice in the market in the free market and then the people decide which tool they want to use based on what they want to get done and then they pay the company for the tool and then they use the tool to create a thing and if that thing gets created and it suddenly soaks up let's say let's say I go into a legacy market that is like uh really old I don't know software ware for garbage companies or something and I'm able to create an unbelievable software suite with AI that ends up taking a monopoly position in software for garbage companies and I'm making literally a billion dollars a year. I don't know what the number is.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Okay, but I I only it only cost me $20,000 end to end to develop that software. I should keep the money. Okay, because because the market hasn't been m is not mature yet. I've just disrupted the market. I've come in and I've disrupted the market with a new software.

### 🎨 セクション 77

But what that's going to do for the next 10 years is that now all of a sudden people are going to be like, "Yo, look this far out idiot. He took 10 minutes to make this this software and has disrupted the legacy system and now he's making all the money." Then all these market competitors will come in and start chipping away at the pie, right? And they'll start taking money away from me over time. That that in this present world, that's how I view it. Now over time, as the AI become really good at prompting you for prompts, like, "Hey, should I run this prompt?

### 🚀 セクション 78

Yeah, this prompt might be a good idea." Then it gets blurry. Then it gets really blurry. And I haven't really thought about that to be honest. So I'd love to hear your take like what how do you view it? Uh well, okay.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So when I'll ask you this right after I I'll throw my opinion. Then the other kind of question I wanted to get to was if um if the company that builds it say Gemini is the model that you're working with if they see that what you're doing to make money and they have essentially access into the queries that make the most money and they also have earlier access than you to the next foundational model are like should they be allowed to just say okay like I understand as soon as he sees this he's going to ask the same question but why don't I just ask it ahead of time and front run him and then at the end you end up with no competition like for Malibu, you just end up with tech companies owning everything. So, um, yeah, I guess that question itself kind of leads towards what I'm thinking, which is that like, yeah, I feel like there should be boundaries and guard rails and some kind of, uh, democratization, some kind of, uh, open insight into what the tech companies have because at a certain point, it just doesn't feel like the competition that makes capitalism great exists very long if you follow that chain down too far. >> You got it. And that's and that's like like what your your framing of that is the the perfect example as to why when you decouple labor from humans, this gets so [ __ ] weird.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Because when you have an army of robots, digital or physical, that can do the work on on my behalf and then just create a better copy using their frontier models that I won't even have access to potentially like. And and so that that's a such a good point. And so the question becomes, yeah, that's it. And so for for that not to happen in our in our capitalistic society, we would have to put a rule set ahead of time. We would have to have some sort of law that says, "Okay, Google, you're only allowed or you're not allowed to frontr run somebody." However, we do that.

### 🎬 セクション 81

I don't even know how we do that. Just like in a similar way, you know, if you look at Apple in the App Store, for example, the the reason why Apple, you know, in the in years past couldn't just whip up their own version of the apps, you know, of like say Spotify comes out, they try with Apple Music. They still somehow Apple pisses me off. Don't even get I'll get off of Apple real quick. Um I think I think for for us to be able to stop that we're going to have to have rules in some way and we're going to have to get ahead of it.

### 📋 セクション 82

I don't I don't know if we're well I don't know where where we're there, right? Because if if we have you know I had a post out there yesterday that said I think AGI by late 27. I could be early on that, but within 5 years, we we're probably going to have uh one company whose AI is so strong that it could theoretically do almost anything in the digital world, almost anything. And it would be able to prompt itself based on analyzing just the world, just whatever's going on, whatever it has access to. And it can just run on basically infinite agents in the background doing that work and just whipping up solutions and then just AB testing them all over the place and see which one sticks.

### ⭐ セクション 83

They'll plug into markets, they'll plug into app stores, whatever, right? And so yeah, it it gets it gets really weird. It gets really really really really freaking weird. And I don't know if that's like, you know, one of one of the pieces we could take, you know, one of one of the angles we could take, which some people say is like, okay, well, that's going to create a new set of competitive forces because you don't know what the economy is going to look like in 5 years when you have that dynamic. And so your time is going to be freed up to do something else or to or to work on something else.

### 📝 セクション 84

But then what I'm thinking about is like I just got addicted to this AI coding thing and it might go away in two years. So what what the hell then? Am I just supposed to run into another thing? Am I supposed to run into and that's that's part of the singularity, right? It's like the second you had done something that that seems like falls directly with your talents that what you really wanted to do and then within 36 months or for you know 48 months all of a sudden that becomes you become obsolete in that process because an AI was birthed that can do that same exact thing you're doing you know I do I don't know I just I don't know that's and that's the scariest part of this whole thing I don't know >> so this is such such an interesting topic so actually so my thinking changed a little bit we we talked to Nick Boowm And I said, you know, how do we create economic system that kind of what we're talking about here preserves human innovation?

### 💡 セクション 85

Like how do we incentivize that when AIs get good? And what he said kind of surprised me because he's like he's like, well, past a certain point >> that's not going to be possible, right? So basically at some point it's going to get to a point where human innovation, we're going to be like kids. It's like how much how do you preserve your dog's innovation around the household? You don't.

### 🔧 セクション 86

You're like, I'll I'll I'll figure it out. We don't need any, you know what I mean? we don't need any any ideas from it. Uh like we'll figure it out and at some point if if the intelligence grows that might happen. So he was almost suggesting like oh let's create little pockets of for humans to explore not nothing important like we don't want humans trying to solve cancer in 20 years if AI can solve it in one month because that's kind of well well let's let's let's put a pin on that.

### 🎯 セクション 87

But he's saying maybe there's areas like some under underwater exploration that's not that as important that we can leave for humans. Interestingly, uh a week or two ago there was a post by somebody. I don't want to mention their name because we're trying to get them on the podcast, but it went it went very um kind of controversial because what I think he was saying and what I think everybody else later he said, "Oh, I didn't mean it." So, I don't know if he was just backpedaling or what, but he was saying that it would be horrible for AI to take over scientific progress because for scientists that would take away from their >> um meaning for their lives. Yeah. >> And people like piled in there like that's the most evil thing possible.

### 💭 セクション 88

Like like you're saying, let's not solve cancer and help these little children that have cancer because you want to have meaning. What do you guys think about that? like how far should we go to preserve human meaning at the point where AI just takes over? >> Yeah. I mean I think the question becomes is it really meaning like what percentage of scientists doing scientific work is actually because it's a meaning or it's because when they grew up their parents told them that you should go to college to become a scientist and so they became a scientist but they really want are passionate about something else.

### 📌 セクション 89

They just haven't been able to explore it or they're afraid to explore it. So they feel like they have to be a scientist. And so they get insecure when people are like, "Oh no, there's a way better scientist out there that's an AI, so you should give up your job." And they get really defensive. I bet you that's 80% of most people doing whatever they're doing, right? But the top 20, like the top 20, bottom 20, what, however you want to think about it, the 20% of the population that is actually in a space where they're doing something because they truly love it.

### ✅ セクション 90

In theory, in theory, like thought experiment, if you truly love something, are you going to stop doing it if some something else is doing it better than you? You're probably not even thinking about that because you love it. In theory, I don't know. Like, like for example, if I if I think about what's something I love? Guitar.

### 📚 セクション 91

I love playing my guitars. Okay. Am I the best guitars in the world? I'm not even top 90%. Okay.

### 🔖 セクション 92

I'm top 50%. Let's say I'm a little modest. I I know how to play guitar. I've been playing guitar for 20 years. >> I've heard you play Metallica, man.

### 🎨 セクション 93

It sounds great. >> Thank you. Metallica is my favorite band. You know, I I love I love playing Metallica, but but I play it because I love it, right? And I'm not like sitting here like, "Oh my god, John Petrrui or James Hfield or, you know, uh, Angry, you know, Angry Minam or, you know, Steve Vi and all these guitarists out there.

### 🚀 セクション 94

They're so much better than I am. I should just give up. No, I'm going to [ __ ] play my guitar because I love playing guitar." Okay. So, but but then that that transitions the the discussion of like the economy from are are people doing things because they love it. Do they get a high or some sort of fulfillment from helping other people?

### ⚡ セクション 95

Do they like seeing the bank number go up? Do they like seeing profit number go up? Do they love solving the processes in the business? Like what what are the things that they're looking for? that those are the complicated questions and it all goes back to human nature, right?

### 🌟 セクション 96

It's like and each human has different wants and needs and and sort of things that make him happy. And one of the things about society I will say like this is sort of like the positive side of the AI angle is that I do think in a capitalistic society in a lot of different ways especially in the United States I think most people are working because they have to not because they want to and so will AI open up the doors for them to actually do what they want maybe most people don't want to work in 9 to5 and you know make money to live life all right maybe they don't But what happens to the people that do want to do that? How will they find a new meaning in life? And they're there, you know, and this is where I think faith is going to explode um because of all these disruptions we're talking about. This is going to happen.

### 🎬 セクション 97

This this is that messy transition that we're going to have to >> we should probably exploit that concept you just said with faith. But I will throw in one thing is um you know what I think is weird is I I don't really have like a skill like a guitar or something that I'm just like or poems that I'm like dying to just do all day long if the world is providing everything for me. But I do I'm I'm just really curious about what we're going to learn about everything. Like I got this feeling that in our lifetimes ASI is going to say, "Hey, like here's really what's happening with quantum mechanics." like actually there is aliens or like do you know black holes actually mean this and that and like we're in a simulation or or not or and I think it's just going to be why and be like oh you didn't know about this but if you manipulate physics in this way and material in this way then you can actually send stuff across the room like way better than Wi-Fi like or light doesn't work the way we think it does like it's just I don't think I'll get tired because every time I open up my app it'll probably be some like once in a century breakthrough happening every 20 minutes and it just will be endlessly like addictive to me, you know, it'll be the Tik Tok of of knowledge. >> Yeah.

### 📋 セクション 98

>> But that's for you specifically, right? And that's what's fascinating. >> That was more like >> Wes's question towards like how will we feel about it? Yeah. For sure.

### ⭐ セクション 99

Specifically. >> And I'm right there with you, too. Like I think I think the amount of light bulb and mind-blow moments we'll have. It's like that that becomes the addiction. It's like human progress, civilizational progress, like discoveries.

### 📝 セクション 100

That becomes its own its own thing that we're like that that becomes a Tik Tok for nerds. Like if you really think about it, you know, that's like somebody will come up with a social media thing with feed like, you know, [ __ ] talk or whatever they call it. I don't know. Just go in and just discovery after discovery after discovery. But it will I do think it's going to rewrite the the fabric of of it's going to it in in a good scenario it should allow the fabric of humanity to actually optimize itself at the individual level to to hopefully enable that person to maximize their humanity whatever that exists whatever that means rather but can you can you break down your comment on faith cuz I was kind of wondering when when information becomes so overwhelming and it might actually feel like magic to the average person, >> faith might take root in a in a way that we've never seen before.

### 💡 セクション 101

But I wanted to see what do you think about faith and and the future of overwhelming information. Yeah. I I think I think it's going to be more about like the when when you have a when you have a system that can do everything you can do that you assigned yourself as I have to do this to survive especially for men. I think this is probably a man question more than a woman question from my perspective. I think it's going to cause a lot of people to pause for a hot second for the first time in their lives and be like holy [ __ ] like like why have I been doing this this whole time?

### 🔧 セクション 102

What's my true purpose? Why am I here? Like, am I am I doing the right thing? Why did this happen? Did the system like like somehow chew me up and spit me out?

### 🎯 セクション 103

There's just going to be a lot of feelings and emotions and questions from people who who have been plugged into this sort of capitalistic system of like like just going on the hamster wheel and just going through the motions and make sure that they're surviving to like a place where they're going to just have a time to breathe and be like, "Wow, like what what just happened?" And I think I think humans you know like if you really go back to the earliest times and you guys correct me if I'm wrong if you think my thesis is wrong here but when we had the least amount of things to do we were highly spiritual we looked up to the stars and we're like what is out there that is crazy and then we came up with with things like you know that's that's the god of whatever you know the reason you know the reason why the stars exist is because whatever god is crying or you know the storm came in god is pissed like there's so many different variations of this. So the more time humans have had to sort of just just sit there and and and imagine, the more faith has has sort of like propagated through humanity, but as we've become more like the societies that are the most secular are the ones that are the most capitalistic from from what I from my studying and I I could be 100% wrong in that, but that so if you remove that that trend and you go back towards hey people have more time now whatever hopefully in a good way like hey everything's taken care of for you like you you don't have to worry about food, shelter, things you want to do, like you got it. Like that time should should open up more people to just question and to and to and and then and then faith like faith doesn't even have to be religion. Like faith to me is just like a connection to something greater. Either either like a greater purpose for yourself, a greater purpose for your family, a greater purpose for your friends or or religion or God, right?

### 💭 セクション 104

You know, and and we'll see. I don't know. What do you guys think? I agree with uh so much of what you're saying and I I I I like how you said it doesn't have to be religion. Um a lot of people I think sort of maybe don't understand that connection.

### 📌 セクション 105

I mean how I I understand it. So religion is a little bit more about this is how the the church or the governing body of the religion tells you to behave. It's more for like control of the people so to speak. Uh that's that's different from belief and and and um sort of having some belief or or or having some connection to the universe, whatever you want to call it, whatever name you want to use. To me, that's that's different.

### ✅ セクション 106

One is a little bit more one-on-one, a little bit more personal. The other one is a little bit more part of society structures. And so I think when people point out like the bad things that happen, it's usually like religious. Do you know what I mean? It's more about somebody telling you to behave this way.

### 📚 セクション 107

Um, nothing horrible happens when somebody sits on a mountaintop and just like feels in connection with the nature around him like that. Nothing bad comes out of that, I don't think. Um, and I think it's very important. I recently was listening to a podcast with Tim Ferrris. He was interviewing somebody that's a professor at one some prestigious school and he studies in part happiness like what makes us happy because often times what we think is going to make us happy isn't right because we think once we get to this point we'll be happy and that never happens or or maybe it happens for five minutes you you know you get a a big exit or you reach some point or whatever you're happy for 5 minutes uh and then it goes away.

### 🔖 セクション 108

But one of the things that he's saying is this idea of being connected to the universe and making yourself small is something that gives us happiness because when we think we're the biggest thing out there, the most important thing out there and we have this rigidity like we oh I can't can't lower my status by a single point. Somebody said something bad about me, you know what I mean? Like that rigidity and thinking we're like the center of the universe will make you unhappy. >> Whereas if you just let go and you're like it's fine. Things like stoicism.

### 🎨 セクション 109

The reason why I think when people believe in something greater than themselves, they they tend to be a little bit more relaxed because they realize they don't have to control every single aspect, they can have faith. Um, and I think that, yeah, I'm not sure exactly if I have a point, but just saying that I do agree. I think I think we're saying a lot of the same things. >> Yeah. And I'll throw in one more thought, too.

### 🚀 セクション 110

And so, for me, if I believe something's like a fact, like what I usually mean by that is that I in some sense I have a little bit of a causal structure. Or I can say, "Okay, I think I understand why gravity works." So that like holds the cup to the table and then the cup is made of glass. Like there's just something that I can sort of follow back and then if somebody says something and I have no context for it. They're just like this is true like ghosts or something and I can't really put my head around any uh step-by-step connection. It doesn't always have to be from first principles, but just some something.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Then to me it feels like I have to believe it out of faith. So then I end up asking myself, okay, if I can't connect the actual thing to a story, can I at least trust the person who told me that? Do they have a history of being right about things? And then I can like sort of offload some of that trust until I believe, okay, ghosts are facts because the two people that told me this studied it and they have worked on it. And I can still get caught up believing a lie, having misplaced faith.

### 🌟 セクション 112

But um hopefully with AI they can it can kind of understand anthropology and uh history and archaeology in a way where it starts to put together a lot of pieces that we've never seen before and there should be sort of a causal link to how a lot of things happen in the universe and then it can become more real. But on the flip side of that, I also thought 10 years ago the internet would bring the truth to all of us. But instead, flooding it with clickbaity garbage turned out to make more sense, might just be more emotional, right? Because linking anthropology to our current society probably does work. But also, once again, people aren't going to be clicking on that in mass and and talking about that in mass and it might still be a tiny part of the future >> even if it exists out there.

### 🎬 セクション 113

I do think like I mean the internet example is such a such a brilliant one. It's like what the internet has really done, it has amplified human nature and that's why you have clickbait everywhere and and and sort of like doom scrolling and sort of like this dopamine hijack. It's because that's how humans act. And so the the the thing was optimized to hijack human nature. And so you're like, well, if AI follows that same sort of trend, then in that's the bad part of the internet.

### 📋 セクション 114

The good part of the internet is this like what we're doing right now. It's connecting people that would have never in a thousand years connected before and we're having this sort of you know this conversation that we're trying to figure out where the future's going in in relation to this technology and how to prepare for it right that's that's a beautiful part of the internet and so the you know how AI will sort of transform this in theory it will just be accelerant on that in in a in a I guess good case scenario I guess um it would just make that even more more stronger more prevalent faster faster, easier to access, more democratized, uh, cheaper, etc., etc. I do think, you know, I don't know if I'm like maybe like too woo woo about this, but I also think, you know, the I I do think humans I don't know, man, like depending on what you believe or not, like I'm I'm still I'm not a religious person, but I've definitely grown spiritual over time as I've um sort of, you know, became a parent and have have time have had time to explore that. I mean, I'm like a perfect use case of what I just said before. It's like, you know, I haven't had a corporate job in five years because I'm I'm lucky enough to follow my own path and do my own thing and I, you know, I don't have to necessarily do this, but I choose to do it because I love it, right?

### ⭐ セクション 115

So, but that has given me a lot of time to be introspective about it. And I just I don't know there's just it could just be the chemicals in my brain or something. But I just feel like there's something there that that's just underneath this physical 4D thing that we live in with time and space that we just and will AI figure that out like is does AI have a you know does the compute cluster and the energy have a direct path to the other layers that could potentially exist where they can sort of help us understand that? I don't know. It gets really weird.

### 📝 セクション 116

>> So, so knowing what you know now in 2026, um do do you wish that in the early days of Facebook and Twitter that there would have been some kind of government foresight or regulation that said don't always optimize for attention, profit, sex. And there was some sort of um idea that you don't just play on humans emotions but try to have facts or you think it's just better this way. >> I mean I think I think that's a fascinating question. I saw that one podcast with uh Tristan Harris on the diary of a CEO where he I don't know if you guys saw that one but he was sort of you know like imagine how much better the world would be if we had these controls in place. But I don't know like I'm and this is sort of like a hard thing to think through like if I think about my my own child like what is the best lesson it's uh experiencing the thing right like that's the thing that actually gets gets you to learn really deeply what has happened so that you can correct for the mistakes and optimize for the things that things it does well right and so putting too many controls ahead of time could prevent us from really learning the lesson of what we've we've learned with like addictive social media algorithms which is that hey being in front of a screen for you is really bad.

### 💡 セクション 117

The downside of that is that we probably have a mental health epidemic with our youngest generation right in in in this country. But the but the other side of that is that we have gained so much knowledge, so much expertise. We've learned so much from these systems. Not just the things they do bad, but the things they do well. the amount of reach you can get.

Like one of the byproducts of having an algorithm that just optimizes for dopamine is that you also get these incredible stories that propagate through the entire world. That's an like and like if you have an algorithm that's artificially controlled in theory it could suppress some of the things that should be reaching much much wider like the stuff that's going on in Iran right now you know like what's why should I why should I put the Iran thing or the you know all the stuff that happened in you know Israel Gaza and all these terrible things that happen around the world that could have a very fundamental impact to how people think about the world those things would be would be suppressed because it's like well that's bad for mental health so why like we shouldn't put this in front of people all the But it also like but if we didn't have that then people would have a false sense of what's going on and it you know that could promote a slow creep of authoritarian rule or violence or you know over time where now their communities start getting overrun with things that they didn't plan for. So it it's it has this is sort of this double-edged sword. So I'm I'm much more on the and and this is sort of like you know I think it's a philosophical question is like if you're alive this is how I think about the world. If you're alive, you should accept the good with the bad and and the plan should be to just optimize for positive results as you get more data.

### 🎯 セクション 119

But you I think Go ahead. Sorry. >> So, I was say um it's it seemed like you pretty quickly sort of framed it as um like censorship versus non-censorship. But what if we frame it a little bit more as uh Facebook is serving the advertiser versus serving the customer? So if they made money from you paying $20 a month for Facebook, their incentive would be a little bit different than to make you scared about stink being stinky and selling you deodorant.

### 💭 セクション 120

>> But I think that's where the competitive market forces come in. And so like that's why X is performing as well as it is because that it's actually taking that that perspective and that's why people like me never go on Facebook anymore because because X is a much better system for me, right? And so I think and I think that's where that's where the the regulations and the governmental systems have to allow for competition to come in to actually serve what humans want. Whereas if we have a central force that tries to dictate too many rules like let's say they they have that and say Facebook you can't do that then in theory X I mean I'm biased here but I do think I I I love X because it's sort of chaotic and crazy but it it works because they're not really beholden to the advertisers because if they were okay they would be a completely different a completely different sort of uh uh social media platform right so I I think that solution is solved by uh by free markets and allowing ing people to build things by exploring what people actually want and what they could benefit from. And then hopefully as we get better and better AI tools and services and products and stuff, all those things can be married up with what people are naturally good at and then we get killer super good products and services that come through.

### 📌 セクション 121

Some of them will serve the people that just want to hit there and sort of just press dopamine button until they die. That could be a byproduct of I mean that's definitely going to be a byproduct of of having this sort of uh sort of approach. But on the flip side, it will also enable who knows how many people to fulfill their truest potential and it will maximize human flourishing but it will also maximize hum human human pain. So the question becomes what are people comfortable with? Are we comfortable with a huge one of these or do we want to kind of keep it like this?

### ✅ セクション 122

But then the people up here are going to get pissed and then people up here are probably going to try to find their own way of doing it and that's going to create conflict. Whereas if you just allow human nature to peripherate everywhere then in theory you're you're just kind of like you're just going to have the worst things of both. But then the bad part of that is like the people down here are going to be like what the [ __ ] I want that. And then it's I don't know dude like everything everything's crazy. >> Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 123

So I just couple things cuz I mean I'm definitely leaning more towards with what Fzad is saying in terms of one the whole censorship thing. I'm a little bit scared of that, right? That's that's playing with fire thing just giving government control to say what what we're allowed to say. Um number two is this idea that it's probably going to get better with market forces as opposed to some you know a few politicians somewhere making decisions before they know what they're doing. I mean, EU and AI is the perfect example.

### 🔖 セクション 124

And also, I was in e-commerce when they did the whole cookie notices and I was just I was like, man, this is the stupidest thing ever. Um, it's not going to do what they what they think they're it it it's just it's it's very backwards because I think it comes from hubris. A few people going there, we're so smart. We can make laws to make things better. But then there's no accountability when there's unintended consequences.

### 🎨 セクション 125

And there always are. But the other thing that I want to point out, so I started in uh marketing online in 2010, 2011 thereabouts. And so I I was doing a lot of like split tests. That's one of the things where you you have one page and another page. One thing that absolutely blew my mind that I think is so counterintuitive to a lot of people is that often times you have you're selling a product, it's the same price, same product, it's the same everything, but you change some visual aspect of the web page.

### 🚀 セクション 126

You use a black and white theme instead of a red and yellow theme or whatever. and then you show it to a statistically significant number of people, right? A a large group of people, and you notice, okay, this page always does better. And it's like, why? If we're rational creatures, why is a blue background make us want to buy more than a white background or whatever?

### ⚡ セクション 127

Like, it it doesn't make sense, but that's how our brains function. And that's exactly what you said, like it it magnified human nature, but uh I think the reason why is because it allowed us to really track it and measure it, right? Like if we if we give them this news article, they don't respond. But if we give them something that like outrages them and makes them scared and angry that oh they click and they talk about and they send it to all their family members and people saw them like okay like we can tap into that like whatever amigdala response that fear center and just like in fact one of the early Facebook algorithm like the early AI stuff figured out if they make people more politically extreme they can get them to get more engaged because they send them that extreme content more and more which is like insane. So, um, you know, with what we're talking about here, Dylan, I totally agree that it had negative effects.

### 🌟 セクション 128

Like, I think most people, no one's denying it. >> Um, and I think that >> Sorry, the thing I was just kind of like I've been playing around with this idea is, um, I obviously hate the idea of a like a single person, a group of politicians censoring, controlling. But I also look at what the actual market does. And that what it is is it's a company that wants to make money and what they get money for is attention and advertisers pay for that attention and that's totally free market. If if the government for just a thought experiment like if the government was to say to Meta, hey, if there's twice as many STEM students that graduate from high school in the next four years, we'll give you a huge tax break and a trillion dollars cash.

### 🎬 セクション 129

Then they could choose that with their free market, you know, choices. And if that turned out to be more money than playing towards advertisers, they would change the algorithm and nobody would say that's censorship. They would change it to hit that incentive and the byproduct would be like a completely different outcome. So there's just this sort of sort of incentive structure that is created and it kind of gets mixed in with capitalism and it kind of gets mixed in with censorship. But the incentive to make money is like what's driving everything.

### 📋 セクション 130

>> Yeah. But I do I do think on the flip side too, like there are natural uh grassroots movements by humans that choose to not take part of that game, however addictive it is. So if you like look at some of the younger generations that are coming up now, there's this sort of counter movement of like we're not going to get a cell phone. We're going to get a flip phone cuz everybody has a cell phone. I don't want a [ __ ] cell phone.

### ⭐ セクション 131

I want to be cool. I'm going to do a flip phone, right? Oh no, we're going to go bowling. We're not going to go to we're not going to go on our computers and like doom screw. No, we're going to we're going to do things together.

### 📝 セクション 132

For some reason, hanging out is becoming counterculture, right? But then but then that that itself could could be like the again, this is where like human this is where it's so hard to figure out what the hell we should do because humans are a black box in a lot of different ways. Like like we think we know how we're going to act, but we don't really know how we're going to act. Even if we have these market forces and these like optimized systems that will hijack our our brains, we're still going to have pockets that could grow over time because people just they're just people. They're like, "No, I don't want to do that anymore." Yeah.

### 💡 セクション 133

Am I addicted? Yeah. Like for example, you know, tobacco, alcohol, uh you know, you have this drug drug epidemic with like fentinyl and all that stuff, right? These are all all of them are highly addictive and and huge problems. Um, the tobacco industry got addressed because we literally outlawed it and said, "Okay, we all agree this is bad." So, sort of to your point, Dylan, right?

### 🔧 セクション 134

We all agree there's nothing good that can come out of this. So, bad. We're going to tax the [ __ ] out of it. We're going, you know, we're going to plaster terrible images on every uh cigarette pack in the in the EU and other places. We're going to have ads that's, you know, you can't you can't advertise for it.

### 🎯 セクション 135

Uh, we we're constantly going to tell you it's bad. People are still going to choose to do it. That's fine, but great. But alcohol, you have the opposite thing. You have a lot of people uh you know drink be a lot of people drink because it's sort of culturally acceptable but we also have a lot of advertising that comes in and says hey you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do or oh you should do this you should do this look at how cool you know this uh superstar looks drinking a bottle of whatever right that is actually allowed but you're still seeing this decline in alcohol usage it could be because weed's becoming more prevalent maybe they're using a different vice for that but there's also like a decision that people are taking like you know what feel like [ __ ] when I when I drink.

### 💭 セクション 136

I get hung over all the time. I'm just going to stop. Yeah. Is it fun? Of course.

### 📌 セクション 137

You know, and it's like even even dopamine like and this is where like the self-correcting system of the human I think is sometimes underrated is like nobody feels good. Everybody knows doom scrolling is bad. It's just addictive. You still want to get the hit, right? You still want to go in and start scrolling, but you know it's bad.

### ✅ セクション 138

You know it's bad. And so at some point for for for the people that hit a wall or hit rock bottom or or something happens in their lives, a lot of them make a decision to say, "Well, you know what? I'm going to massively limit my usage. I'm going to be much smarter about it." Maybe AI systems get really good at just giving you summaries of what happened so that you can make the decision for yourself to say, you know what, I'm not going to do this anymore. And that's one thing that I try not to underestimate with humans is that they are self-correcting sort of beings.

### 📚 セクション 139

I I Do do you uh for you Wes also, but like do you both believe that um social media would be better for society if each user was able to choose our own algorithm? If we had a free market of algorithms that would give us the kind of content we want? >> I think I think it would be >> or do you like it being sort of dictated by the owner of the social network? >> I like both. I mean, I like both, but I'll be honest like at some point the algorithm like for example the 4U algorithm for me on X is unbelievable right now for me.

### 🔖 セクション 140

Mhm. >> It's like it's like it's it's not even negative. It's just like super tailored to the thing that I'm obsessed about right now. And I don't necessarily find myself like obsessively looking for stuff as as much as I would have in the past if it was just like the political stuff that I was sort of kneede in a couple years ago or whatever. Um so so my my my following feed is useless or like you know I don't even know sort of how you know it becomes a question of like how much time do people want to spend to actually curate their their their millio algorithms.

### 🎨 セクション 141

I think most people will just let the system pick for them like just tell me what to do and I think one of the things could be is that just most people might have much better self-control than I have. >> Yeah. Okay. You don't want people to have you don't think it's good for people to have that freedom >> to choose their own algorithm. You think it's better if it's dictated?

### 🚀 セクション 142

>> I think I think I think >> I think it would be great to have a social media network that allows somebody to make their own algorithm. But I just I just think that over time people will just not use it anyway because because they're not going to keep up the work to craft an algorithm to change with how they're changing because humans I think humans change dayto day, week to week and month to month. what might be interesting to you one week is probably not interesting to you the next week or there are pockets of knowledge that that you might be interested in that might change any given day. I I could be wrong, right? But I think I think if both are present, you know, so like the perfect AB test would be for a social media company if if Elon would want to do this, oh this will be fantastic.

### ⚡ セクション 143

Allow people to do their own algorithm. Let us let us have our own algorithm and like sort of go in and sort of craft it and then do an AB test like okay which where do they spend most of their time their crafted algorithm or the for you algorithm? And my guess is over time, you know, 12 months, 18 months down the line, 90% of people who made their own algorithm will go back to the for you. >> You know, that's almost like exactly like trying to eat healthy. Like I um like you you could you could bet that in the future I will eat unhealthy.

### 🌟 セクション 144

However, in my house I only have healthy food. And I made that choice and it does help me and and maybe 10% of people who make that choice will stick to it. But I certainly like the freedom of not being forced to see junk food every time I come home. To me, that's part of an important part of society. So, >> I mean, I don't think I don't think anyone's in favor of not being able to control the algorithm.

### 🎬 セクション 145

Uh, I don't think there's a single person that's like, "Oh, I want somebody else to just determine everything for me." Um, I think the question is, you know, if it is in the hands of the companies, there is some push back that we can have. There's market forces. We can choose what we see. Like X is more open than other companies. So, I choose to be there.

### 📋 セクション 146

uh versus something else that's a little bit more like where where they'll um shut down certain opinions or whatever. Uh we have more control if it's if it's a free market. If it's the government, we have a lot less control. And that's why I think that it's so scary to just hand them the reigns. Like I don't want EU controlling what I'm allowed to say.

### ⭐ セクション 147

Um maybe that comes from me where I I I was born in the USSR. So maybe my I'm a little bit overc calibrated for that, but I mean you you see that playing out with like Putin and Russia right now where he's like, "Well, you can't talk about this." And maybe we'd agree with some of those things that he doesn't want us to talk about, like whatever. Like you don't, you know, don't talk about this bad thing that's happening. But he also says, "Hey, don't talk about being gay because we'll put you in jail." Um, and then okay, well, guess what? You might disagree with that, right?

### 📝 セクション 148

No one cares. You can't say anything against it because your opinion is censored. If you speak out against it, you're going to jail. In the UK, you know, you can post some opinion that puts you in jail. That's what we're trying to avoid.

### 💡 セクション 149

So, no one's saying we shouldn't have control. We're saying we should be very careful about who we give the control to. I I think that's kind of the point. >> Yeah. I think I think like the the the lens I view this through is like, you know, absolute power corrupts absolutely, right?

### 🔧 セクション 150

And so as long as humans are in control of of any system or regulation or anything that's dictated even if even if the at the very beginning it is absolutely 100% tailored to protect the humanity on the whole >> eventually those systems will get corrupted eventually when it's when it's when it's controlled by humans. And so in that knowing that I always bias towards well I I would rather take the risk and accept the shortcomings of having with what comes with a free market which optimizes for uh maximization of dopamines and humans right that's one way of thinking about capitalism I will take that because at least there will be market forces that will correct for things that we've done wrong and so like the way I think about the social media thing which is which is fascinating right the the I think the reason why we don't have a social media company that would that has a feed that is curated by the individual it's because that business case right now is not sustainable because nobody really wants that right but the fascinating thing to track is as you know let's let's say people you know let's say the trend of people let's say we have that self-correcting mechanism in humans that says you know what my dopamine addiction sucks. I'm going to go the same route that I did with alcohol. Like I I used to drink three, you know, three glasses a day. I'm not going to drink anymore.

### 🎯 セクション 151

I just feel better. Look at how much better I feel when I adopt this thing because now I'm becoming self-aware of who I am. And that's one huge thing I think our society is really bad at, especially here in the United States, is like a lot of people are not self-aware. This is why we have an obesity ep epidemic. This is why we have a lot of issues with health related things.

### 💭 セクション 152

People don't just have the time and energy to look inwards and be like, "Holy [ __ ] like I'm [ __ ] dying." Right? If if that time gets opened up, then people might be like, "Holy shit." All right. So, I should watch more for my mental mental health. I should watch more for my health health, like my physical health. And then maybe we have those technologies start to peripherate.

### 📌 セクション 153

So, but again, we we would we would have had to suffer the last whatever 10 15 years of the downsides of that for us to learn that lesson. Whereas the flip side of that, if we had a system in place that would have ruled to say, "No, no, these algorithms need to work like this over time, that could have worse effects because then you're giving a a a very big hammer to to a group of people that can come to power and all of a sudden they can say, you know what, talking about the future is bad because you're giving people ideas about the bad things that could happen and bad things make people sad, so you shouldn't talk about the future." You know, that's an extreme scenario, but we we've seen how we've seen how crazy [ __ ] can get. You know, you never know. And so, like, my my predisposition is to avoid that at all costs because I would rather have again I would rather have a competing force to try to make things better than one singular force that says this is how it should be done. >> Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 154

I've been really I've been really playing with the idea of like how we get more free market mechanisms into more locations. is like the beauty of the internet that we have and things being digital is that it doesn't always have to be completely top down. Like you can add, you know, like local cities, um your neighborhoods, HOAs, like there's a lot of tools now that can enable democracy where it's closer to the citizen. Um and I'd love to see that. So, I'm kind of thinking like, yeah, like why can't there be a marketplace where we choose our own algorithm?

### 📚 セクション 155

Why isn't there a marketplace where we can monetize our own following? I can't like why is everything still so hierarchical and it's like the the fang stocks are like literally everything, you know, and it's it would be nice to see that breakdown. So, I've just sort of been playing with some of those ideas, but >> I love that and and the beautiful thing about the trend in AI right now is that you could literally build that. >> Yeah, you're right. >> Yeah.

### 🔖 セクション 156

Cloud code something for your HOA and make it work more efficient. we get AI right in this sense because again if it's too centralized then we're kind of repeating the same mistakes with social media or whatever. So that's actually what I want to ask both of you guys like AI seems like it might solve a lot of these problems. You want your own algorithm fine cuz you don't have to navigate the web the AI can be kind of like a like an in between person for your filter gives you what you want to see block what you you don't want to see go and find the stuff that that you want etc. So with that in mind and understanding how the social media developed over the last whatever 10 20 years what would you do like what do you think is should the approach to AI be right if we wanted to get to where we're going right you know reduce the bad stuff improve the good stuff like how do you guys think about that yeah I mean we're right now we're seeing the uh kind of emergence of different personalities in the LLMs I don't know if you've seen some of there was a thing I covered in my last video or they just had an actual like psychologist sort of ask the same questions of the major models to probe their history to probe their like anxiety levels.

### 🎨 セクション 157

All these kind of very human things and they had distinct patterns and I would almost call them personalities. I mean Claude actually seems like it feels pretty guilty when it fails its user and it it uses lots of verbiage like that over and over again. Of course it's not connected to an actual hormone and all of that stuff but it's like it's just interesting. Yeah. And like the confidence in Grock and the kind of playfulness of Grock was really interesting, the non-seriousness of it and Gemini's like professionalism.

### 🚀 セクション 158

You know, there's sort of fascinating kind of personality quirks in there and they're we'll kind of have to live with them and sort of know them like people and I think that'll be sort of how it plays out. >> Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I think I think as long as we have competing companies that are, you know, approaching for the solution in their own way, that's the beauty of a free market is that we're going to get in theory more and more solutions that are going to be sort of optimized for a special use case that they think it's important and then the market will decide if those things actually should survive or not based on how many people actually find that thing useful.

### ⚡ セクション 159

Right? Okay. So, I think as I think as long as we have that dynamic, I I'm I'm much less worried about you. It it literally all comes down to the free market for me or some for some form of market mechanism where there can be competition. As long as we have that, we'll have the mechanism for the thing to actually be the way it's supposed to be.

### 🌟 セクション 160

Because if a market exists, then humans get to vote. We get to vote by using the thing. And if we use the thing, the things that we use actually survive. And if better things come along that displace the old things, then we use those new things, you know. And I I think that's I think that's the way it it it should go in my opinion.

### 🎬 セクション 161

And whatever that looks like, it looks like, you know, does that answer your question? >> Yeah, absolutely. That that that definitely makes sense. Um it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out. Yeah.

### 📋 セクション 162

My biggest fear is we kind of screw it up by >> I don't know. There's a lot of ways to screw it up and there's probably a few ways to get it right. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I have all the answers, obviously. So, one thing we touched about uh touched on a little bit earlier is kind of like we talked about um faith.

### ⭐ セクション 163

So, what's interesting is that a lot of people that I see now in the AI space uh researchers, people that are kind of like adjacent to to the space more and more the idea of this being a simulation is being discussed and seriously talked about, right? So, people are saying why is why do all the laws of the the universe seem to be like they could be reduced to a formula? Why is everything can be a a computation? That seems a little bit weird, right? Like the light whatever E X equals MC² like stuff like that.

### 📝 セクション 164

Why is like what's why is there a speed of light? Why do we have a speed limit of how fast we can travel? All sorts of weird stuff at at the quantum level that people argue about whatever. Um and more and more serious people are like open to this idea. Uh I wonder what what your take is.

### 💡 セクション 165

I mean do you think that's a possibility? And what does it mean? Do we live in a simulation? >> Do we live in a simulation? So, you know, you know what my uh what my um conclusion is on this, and I this is probably a very dumb take, but >> regardless of whatever path you take, >> um unless you think we've always been here forever, even if we were here forever, like forever and ever, and it's always existed, I I just can't conceptualize the sort of idea that this has always in here like like it had to have been created at some point is like right like and so so I have to think through that and so that feels right to me this is how this is how faith works for me in my head um this is that feels right to me I don't think I don't think everything has existed forever and there was no beginning of time and no end of time and so by default that means that there had to be some creative force that create the big bang, God, what, whatever, simulation, all of these different ways that we try to figure out if we exist or not, all are anchored around the thing that says something was created.

### 🔧 セクション 166

And so by default, there has to be a creator. And if there is a creator, that form of the creator is much less sort of like important to me. And for me it's much more like there is something a force that may us exist in whatever thing that we exist in. And that's endlessly fascinating to me cuz the only way to debunk that is to say that everything has always existed. There was no beginning or an end which some religions sort of are are on, right?

### 🎯 セクション 167

Like there's no beginning or end. Like you exist. This is reality. You are you exist in this thing and that's just what it is. And that in itself is [ __ ] crazy, too.

### 💭 セクション 168

>> Yeah. >> Right. So, it's like, >> yeah, >> it's it's just so hard to conceptualize. >> It does kind of force that question, too. Like, okay, if a god did create the big bang, like what created his universe and then what created his universe and its turtles all the way down?

### 📌 セクション 169

So, you end up at infinity again. >> Exactly. Exactly. So, it's it's I don't know, man. Like, I I don't know, you know, I I've sort of started thinking about this differently.

### ✅ セクション 170

It's I don't know if it's even useful to spend any time thinking about why we're here or how we were created. I I maybe I mean maybe this is just a stage of my life that I mean this is probably more than anything that for me I'm speaking for me specifically. I think there's too many things for us that we need to work on to wonder where we came from or who created us. I think it's super fun and important to sort of have have a connection to it at some point. But like for me it's like we have a lot of stuff to do, you know?

### 📚 セクション 171

So it's like I haven't spent too much time thinking about that. I've sort of just accepted the fact that we exist and it we were probably created in some way and maybe that creator was created in some way and you know the turtles all the way down thing. Yeah. It create gets absolutely nuts and crazy but we're still here in some like regardless of what direction you take this is unbelievable and that's awesome, right? It's like and and that and I think that makes me specifically appreciate every moment much more than I have in the past because I realize just how unbelievable that is regardless of whatever path you take down on.

### 🔖 セクション 172

But if you're going to ask me specifically what is the odd that we live in a simulation, I would say it's the same odds as uh Jesus Christ, you know, uh being resurrected or Muhammad, you know, receiving a message from God. That's that is how I think about these concepts. is like they're all likely in the equal, you know, equal to statical statistical percentages. >> That makes sense. Yep.

### 🎨 セクション 173

>> Yeah. I was going to ask, so it does kind of feel like we don't have that much time on Earth and sometimes it's not worth thinking about these things too much, but also there's a few people that really really believe AGI and ASI is around the corner that I've been talking with and they're starting to find themselves more calm, uh, less anxious even though things are changing because they're really relying on this idea that longevity will be extended forever. um they're kind of thinking each year kind of after 2030 l long longevity will get more and more solved. AI will understand crisper genetics won't genetic diseases won't be a problem. Cancers will be cured.

### 🚀 セクション 174

Maybe sometimes people still get hit by buses in ways that can't be recompiled, but medicine will be much closer to living forever than uh than anybody would believe instinctively right now. Do you think you're going to be alive in another one or two or 300 years to chat with us? >> No. Honestly, I don't know if I want I would want to be honestly I think I think um and this my feeling has changed about death uh a lot. Um, death is a part of life and I think it's important to experience life in like the the reason why I I became a father was because I really desperately wanted to know what it felt like to have a child because I felt like if I didn't have kids, I would miss out on one of the most important parts of being alive, which is to have an offspring and and to have that offspring with somebody you love and to raise that offspring together and get to experience that together.

### ⚡ セクション 175

That to me was very important. Um and in the same token I mean everybody dies and so the question becomes like does everybody have to die you know does everybody like have to die and so if even if I had you know even if you know like how many how many organic how many organic organisms how many organisms exist that don't die I think it's a target grade is the only one does does the target does it die I think it even dies right >> there's a few that theoretically could live forever I think there's like a jellyfish and a lobster disturb. I mean, they still die, but I think theoretically they could be kept alive forever. Yeah. >> Yeah.

### 🌟 セクション 176

So, we all die, so I I'll die. >> Yeah. >> You know, and it's it's sort of like it used to be scary to think about it, but honestly, it's like, you know, am I going to take steps to be around as long as possible to see my kids grow up? Of course. You know, as long as it's like as as long as it doesn't feel like torture and I don't feel like I'm being a burden, I would love to be around for as long as possible.

### 🎬 セクション 177

And if that and and if that means like you know I I get to experience a lot of life that I would have never experienced before because I I'm able to live to be 200 years old and I get to explore the moon and Mars and explore knowledge and the meaning of life and the oceans and you know crazy stuff with my with the people that I love. Whatever that means as long as it feels right I will be alive. But I am even death doesn't really scare me anymore. And it's not it's not one of those things that I'm really look look at as like uh like like even if AI agi is coming like my length of life is irrespective of that. I think I'm much more like I I'm much more on the camp of I think humanity's will will drive the ship forward whatever that is.

### 📋 セクション 178

Because that's what we've done. We've survived a lot of crazy [ __ ] as a species. And there have been extinction events, but those were completely outside of our control. And so I think as long as we are in control, even if a AGI or SI might feel like it's not in our control, I would like to think it's going to be in our control because we're going to build the proper safeguards to ensure that it's in our control in some respects. At the very least, it respects us in the way that the universe respects us.

### ⭐ セクション 179

Okay. But also the universe can be like, "Ah, [ __ ] it, Meteor. You're dead." >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Right.

### 📝 セクション 180

>> Happened before. Yeah. >> I don't know. I don't know. Yeah.

### 💡 セクション 181

>> So, just as you're talking, something just You gave me an idea. I've never actually asked people this before. So, you mentioned there's a few. So, there's this thing called the I think it's called the immortal jellyfish. So, they they they die.

### 🔧 セクション 182

Technically, they at some point run into some issue and die, but they don't age because they kind of go through their maturity cycle from a baby to an adult to and but once they're getting old into kind of kind of that scinessence into the the senior years, they like cast I think they cast off most of itself and it it's reborn almost like not an embryo, but almost as a baby. So, it like starts over again as a fresh Yeah. Uh, I just realized I mean what if people at some point had that opportunity? So kind of like uh like a one of those rogue like video games where you know you live your entire life then you kind of get a reset and maybe you keep some of your memories and some of your skills or whatever but everything is sort of new. You get to start over.

### 🎯 セクション 183

Would you guys take and you know you get another hundred years let's say would you guys do that? >> I don't know if that's you anymore though. Is it >> it's it's like resetting to an earlier state of view, I would say. So, is it that's that's a hard question, but yeah. >> Yeah.

### 💭 セクション 184

I mean, I I don't That's such a crazy hypothetical. Uh >> yeah, >> it's kind of like it's kind of like a flower or a tree, right? When they pollinate, you know, like it's like they they're taking or like how we reproduce. Like my son is technically me, but it's like half me, half my wife, right? So like having children is kind of that already if you really think about it, but like the organic form of that.

### 📌 セクション 185

>> Mhm. >> Um dude, I don't know. I don't even know like >> cuz cuz I do see what consciousness is is something that kind of grew. Like I do think when I was a baby, I had to like look in the mirror and sort of recognize that like I existed in the world and a certain sense of self wasn't there at the very moment of conception that kind of emerged. So, if you're just shedding your skin and you're keeping all of that, then yeah, I mean, life already is kind of like water flowing down a river, it has cells like skin cells are falling off and things are changing all the time.

### ✅ セクション 186

And you know, who's to say that if >> the majority of them reset like all at once, anything different would be there. So yeah, I also agree that I don't know if I want to live forever, but if I'm still in a phase where day by day I'm excited to feel young and happy and in this world and yeah, I I' Yeah, I'd wear a little jelly jellyfish myself. >> Yeah, if it feels good, I'm 100% there. If it feels good and it's and it's great, it's Yeah, like why turn it off >> if I have the ability to keep it on, you know? >> Absolutely.

### 📚 セクション 187

And so I know we've we've we've gone for an hour and a half. I do want to quickly touch on some of the discoveries from you talking to Claude code and your uh genetic testing. So um you mentioned the warrior type, you mentioned the B12 vitamins. I have I think I have the same thing. So, I think it's called the MTHFR mutation.

### 🔖 セクション 188

And one of the things that Yeah, you need some extra vitamins. And apparently, most people are okay with the synthetic vitamins of >> I'm blanking on the name, folic acid, but people with this particular mutation, we can't have that because it just gunks everything up. And we we're supposed to have like the methylated version of it instead. Five HTTP1. I forget what the names are.

### 🎨 セクション 189

But yeah, I do find myself when I when I when I take a few certain supplements and it's it's some of the things that you mentioned. So, it's um it's some B vitamins, creatine helps a lot, NAC, things like that. You got to take your magnesium, your omegas, omega-3s, omega, all that stuff. Uh I do feel a lot better. So, I do want to do that genetic testing, confirm all this.

### 🚀 セクション 190

But what what were your findings? And do you feel a noticeable difference? >> I do. So, so I do notice the B12 actually made a difference. So what the B12 did is actually it so ever since I I became a dad.

### ⚡ セクション 191

Do you guys have kids? >> I have two kids. Yeah. >> You have two kids, Dylan? Um so ours is uh a year and seven months and I haven't felt the same level of energy that I used to have up until I made that switch.

### 🌟 セクション 192

I think I think there was something. Dude, having kids is so hard. >> Yeah. Oh man. >> But it's so amazing.

### 🎬 セクション 193

It's so amazing. It's so worth it's like the the hardest it's the weird this the weirdest like uh counterintuitive oxymoron thing of all time. It's like having kids is easily the hardest thing of all time because it's not even the kids thing. It's like the it's like your entire dynamic and relationship with your partner changes completely cuz all of a sudden like she like like she kind of becomes dependent on you in a lot of different ways because it's like her body has changed, everything has changed about her. like it's it's a unbelievable journey for the woman and so and I you know and so the man has to change the ways and my belief this is what I believe is that they have men have to be really receptive to changing to ensure that the family dynamic is as strong as possible because your partner has fundamentally changed forever everything her brain has changed her body has changed everything's everything's different so with that comes a lot of uh challenges and it's hard and you don't sleep a lot and you're learning new things all the time and you're physically exhausted.

### 📋 セクション 194

>> I can finally do conversations like these again, >> you know, so cuz my brain is actually working. I used to have a lot more brain fog. So, it it solved for a lot of that. I think I've had a lot of deficiencies that have come with becoming a parent, you know, just haven't watched my diet as well as I should. As I get older, sort of like your weaknesses start to appear more than your strengths, right?

### ⭐ セクション 195

So, like you start sort of like that's what happens when you get older. So, so it's it's helped a lot with that. So, it's like understanding who I am at the most. It's like a first principles analysis of an individual and so it's been very helpful with that. So it's that was one thing.

### 📝 セクション 196

Caffeine was another one. So my body is slow in um in uh processing caffeine which means that um after uh you know if I have a cup of coffee or two cups of coffee it's going to last longer. And also I have a predisposition for the caffeine to make me feel a little bit more anxious or jittery. And I've always, you know, for ever since like what is it like >> like like 2018, I've had sort of this like underlying anxiety thing that I've had to sort of work around. It's it's a non-issue now.

### 💡 セクション 197

It used to be a huge issue. Um but like I remember I remember not drinking caffeine helped a lot. And I'm like, "Oh, that's that's kind of like that kind of makes sense." But then I when I actually studied my thing, I'm like, "Okay, that makes perfect sense." It's like the way I process caffeine is different. >> Um so that's been a huge thing for me. It's now to the point now with the B12, I actually don't think I need caffeine anymore because it gives me so much energy that if I do have even the little bit of caffeine, I'm like [ __ ] wired.

### 🔧 セクション 198

I was crazy coming into this interview. I'm still kind of look crazy, you know? But it's just it's just my body processes caffeine differently, you know? Um >> that's so Can I just ask really fast because um you mentioned uh uh taking pre-workouts in for me in 2013, I think it was. I remember I took a a pre-workout.

### 🎯 セクション 199

I was working out and I'll explode for people that that know this thing. And I I've been taking it previously every once in a while, but uh I had a for the first time in my life a massive massive full-blown panic attack. Me too. >> For people that Yeah. that don't know what it is.

### 💭 セクション 200

It's like you can just imagine your body is like ready for war. >> Yeah. >> And you're just like I was at Best Buy shopping for headphones cuz I need to You know what I mean? And my body's like, "Oh, we're about to die. Do you're like the boss music is playing." You're like, "Get ready for battle." Your hands are shaking.

### 📌 セクション 201

I'm like, "No, we're just just hanging out. Everything there's no no issues anywhere. What's going on?" Um, and it kept repeating randomly. Um, so did you have the same experience? And you're saying that maybe Okay.

### ✅ セクション 202

>> Exact, bro. I mean, it's it's funny you tell your story. It's like literally So, mine was I had >> I can't blame Best Buy for it. >> Best stressful. Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 203

>> Yeah. I was in a Best Buy. No. I so I um I had just come back from a trip from South Africa uh with with my friends and uh it was like a 24-hour 22-hour flight, whatever the [ __ ] it was. But like, you know, we were there, we were partying hard, drinking every night, smoking cigarettes every night.

### 🔖 セクション 204

Like my body was just done, dunzo, dunzo. And then we come back crazy jetlagged. And I'm like, on the second day, I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to get up at 5:00 a.m. and I'm going to kickstart my day.

### 🎨 セクション 205

So my body's still jet-lagged. You know, I kicked the [ __ ] out of it. Um this was in 2018, whatever it was. And then I took a I hadn't taken a pre-workout in a minute. And so I took a pre-workout.

### 🚀 セクション 206

I don't know if I did one scoop or nothing or two scoops. And then I remember I remember being on the treadmill and I started feeling this like flatter fight or flight. And I'm like, "What the fuck?" like my heartbeat starts to race and like my my my eyesight starts to narrow and I'm starting to get jittery >> and and I put my hands on I'm like literally just in the first minute of my walk on the treadmill I'm just warming up and I got my hands on the thing and it's going from like 105 and then the next second is 115 and then the next second is 125 and then 135 and then 150 and 160 my heart and I'm like oh my [ __ ] god I'm getting a heart attack. So I started panicking. I started literally panicking like oh my god.

### ⚡ セクション 207

So, I started literally freaking out and it made me hyperventilate. And when you hyperventilate, I don't know if it's the o your oxygen or your carbon, whatever, there's an overload in your system, which actually seizes up your muscles. And then my jaw locked in place and I'm like, "Oh my god, I'm actually having a heart attack." And I laid down on the floor of the [ __ ] gym and all my muscles locked up. And I couldn't move. And I'm literally I literally thought I was going to die.

### 🌟 セクション 208

And my wife was there, >> you know, just watching me. They called an ambulance to put me in an ambulance. They drove me. Yeah. And I remember in the ambulance the the paranomatic was like, "Oh, okay.

### 🎬 セクション 209

Yeah, that's what I thought was happening." And I like and and I heard that and I'm like, "My jaw is locked." I'm like, "What do you mean?" You know, like I'm trying to say. He's like, "Oh, yeah. I know. Like, you're hyperventilated." >> Like, and in my head I'm like, "What?" So, they took me to the hospital. They took a bunch of scans >> and they're like, "Yeah, you're fine.

### 📋 セクション 210

>> Fine." Oh, man. >> I'm like, "What the fuck?" But they never told me. So, here's the problem. They never told me it was uh, you know, I told him what I did. It's like, "Yeah, no." The doctor was like, "Yeah, no, I take pre-workout all the time." That was his solution.

### ⭐ セクション 211

And so the and then I had to take it upon myself months later to do research on this to be like, "Okay, you're actually fine. There's nothing wrong with you. You just have a sensitivity to caffeine." And so what would happen is anytime my heart would like uh my heart rate would um get higher because I'm moving around or whatever, I could like like, "Oh my god, is my heart rate going up?" And then I would check it and then I would freak myself out like, "Oh my god, I'm going to get another panic attack." and it would send me down the path of having anxiety and and and so I had to deal with that for like I don't know two years. I literally had to see a therapist to help me be like I had to do what's cognitive therapy. I forget what it is.

### 📝 セクション 212

>> Yeah. CBT CBT. Is that right? >> Yeah. >> Quote unquote over because I sometimes still get anxiety.

### 💡 セクション 213

I just have to sort of just I'm like I'm fine. Just it will go away. Just wait for it. You just lay your lay your head down. What I did is I laid my head down on my pillow and I could hear my heart rate in in my pillow.

### 🔧 セクション 214

Like my heart was beating in my ear and then and then I'm like, "Oh my god, I I something's going to happen." I told myself, I'm like, "No, you're fine. You're not going to die. You're fine." And I just I just listen to it accelerate like crazy. And then it topped out and I was [ __ ] freaking I was losing my [ __ ] [ __ ] And I told myself, I'm like, "You know what? If you die because you can hear your heart rate, you deserve to die, you [ __ ] pussy." That's what I literally told myself.

### 🎯 セクション 215

Like, your body sucks, bro. You should get Yeah. Like who dies from listen I expected. I thought you were going to say something very lovingly like we're all one with the earth. Like >> no no I literally said I'm like dude if you die because you listen to your heart rate your body sucks.

### 💭 セクション 216

You shouldn't be around. You don't deserve to be around that. It's a very hateful thing to tell yourself. But that's literally what I told myself. And then and then a few seconds later I started feeling my heart rate going down and I'm like oh I didn't die.

### 📌 セクション 217

And then and then that gave me the groundwork to say okay so anytime this happens I don't die. It's just very uncomfortable. And then you just and then you start stepping on that, right? You start then the next time it happens, you're like, "You didn't die. You were there.

### ✅ セクション 218

You remember you were there. Just let it go through." And then each time it gets easier and easier and easier and easier, >> you know? It's it's and I think it's important for especially for guys to talk about their anxiety [ __ ] because I think a lot of dudes don't talk about stuff like this, >> but a lot of people suffer from anxiety, man. It's like kind of like a thing that nobody really talks about, especially guys, is like I think a lot of guys suffer from anxiety and uh in different it manifests very differently. But um but yeah, but it's that's and that's it's all because I had a sensitivity to caffeine.

### 📚 セクション 219

It's crazy. >> Yeah. Yeah. I very good point. I think a lot of people Yeah.

### 🔖 セクション 220

guys especially we don't talk about it. I think it's important to talk about it because um and it's not you don't necessarily need to complain about it or or or or blame stuff on it or you know what I mean that that that that could get into weird territories but we should be talking about it to discuss the tools and the tactics that we can use to get past it because if you understand other people are having similar issues and this is what they did because I I after struggling with it for a year I started doing some of the same things you were saying I was like No, just like what whatever happens happens. Push through it because you realize that at that point, okay, nothing you're not going to die. You're not going to die. You just feel like you are.

### 🎨 セクション 221

You really do. You're like, I don't know. I'm going to drop. Yeah. Yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 222

But you you you push through it. And I mean, I'm sure that we got to, you know, maybe say, you know, obviously if you're having real health iss real, you know what I mean? If you're having a heart attack, you should get checked out, whatever. That's not that's not what was happening to us. It was more of a >> what our brain glitching and misinterpreting some signals that was being sent.

### ⚡ セクション 223

And in that sense, just pushing through it seemed to Yeah. For me as well, at some point it really subsided. So yeah. >> Yeah. It's just accepting it, right?

### 🌟 セクション 224

And I think and this is why I think health is so important is because if you're doing everything you can to at the at the foundation level, like eat as healthy as possible. Get yourself checked on stuff. Do this, you know, uh genetic sort of blood work thing. Give it to Claude Code. Give you a comprehensive sort of tool set.

### 🎬 セクション 225

check, you know, do your yearly exams, whatever you need to do. As long as you've done everything you can, as long as you can look at yourself in the mirror and be like, I've done everything I can to be healthy. Yeah. >> It's out of your hands, bro. >> Like, what else can you do?

### 📋 セクション 226

And so, you just accept you just accept what life has in store for you. And if you if you do get those anxiety attacks, you know what I tell myself now is like, you know, it's an anxiety attack, just accept it. Don't even be mad at it. Just accept the feeling. It is what it is.

### ⭐ セクション 227

It has come on. It's fine. It will go away. and and and the quick and the quicker you can convince yourself of that, the the faster it goes away is what my lesson has been. So, um yeah, just there's a lot to be learned and and props to you for sharing your story, too, because it's like it's important, I think.

### 📝 セクション 228

And especially for people that have a platform, it is so I can't tell you how many times people would reach out to me and be like the that because I made a video about it. Like the one video you did about the anxiety one is the one that really stuck out to me and that's like 50% of the comments I get from people that watch my channel. It's like, "Dude, that anxiety video was awesome." I'm like, "Fuck yeah." I'm so happy to hear that. >> That's awesome. That's amazing.

### 💡 セクション 229

I should start doing more stuff like that because I feel like I guess I I thought, oh, maybe it's not as interesting to people, but I remember in the past other creators that I followed sometimes they talk about personal stuff and it's usually one of the more interesting podcasts, even if it's not about the subject that they that I follow them for, just to get that that human aspect of it because like, yeah, I certainly have a lot of problems that I could talk about. I'm sure at least it'll be entertaining for people. So, >> yeah, for sure. That's humanity, bro. That's all our problems.

### 🔧 セクション 230

That's we make we make the biggest connections through our biggest fights and challenges. And that's a beautiful thing about humanity. >> Okay. And just so for somebody who hasn't had a panic attack, but it might hit them for the first time ever, the thing to notice is your heart rate and to just you think like find a calm place to sit and notice your heart rate and then just kind of talk through it. Yeah.

### 🎯 セクション 231

I mean, I think I think you know I'll talk about what works for me. I think it's very specific for each individual. Uh to be honest, I think the the biggest piece of advice I can tell people is like um just it's it's well it's almost like be com like be try to be calm but it's that's an impossible thing to do when you're having a panic attack panic attack meditation where you're supposed to step back from your thoughts and kind of notice them. Do you feel like that's >> kind of that's helped me a lot for sure? >> Yeah.

### 💭 セクション 232

It's just accepting accepting you oh you know you know what's a book that was phenomenal for helping me with this? Um something monkey brain. What the hell is it called? Uh, let give me one second. Let me look it up because this was a transformative book for me.

### 📌 セクション 233

>> Monkey brain anxiety sounds called >> Oh, don't feed the monkey mind. >> Okay. Right. >> Don't feed the monkey mind. That's that's a such a good book to sort of fight anxiety and and panic attacks and stuff because what it does, it sort of like says, okay, what you're feeling is just a monkey doing this in your in your head like, hey, hey, something wrong, something wrong, something wrong, something wrong.

### ✅ セクション 234

So it helps you sort of comp compartmentalize that specific action and viewing it as its own entity. And so you start to think of your brain as not like, oh, it's you. It's like, no, there's different systems in there that just might be misfiring. And why they're misfiring at that time. It doesn't like it's not the time to figure out why they're misfiring, but they're misfiring.

### 📚 セクション 235

So just know that and just be comfortable that that is actually what's happening. Not this like underlying sensation that says that you're going to die, you're going to collapse. Like oh my god, the worst thing ever is going to happen right now. Like the the the sense of doom and and dread. That is just what is happening right now.

### 🔖 セクション 236

But that's not actually what's happening. That's just your emotions and your feelings. And and just being aware of that in itself is a huge step because that just at least helps you ground. Like it's there's the grounding, right? It helps you ground to reality, which is like you're not dying.

### 🎨 セクション 237

Your brain's just a little [ __ ] up right now. So, it will pass. Give it a second. It will pass. >> And then um it might take 5 minutes.

### 🚀 セクション 238

It might take an hour. I've had pan panic attacks that last for an hour. Like anxiety attacks where I'm literally just [ __ ] knuckle like just like this on the couch waiting for it to go away >> and it just doesn't cuz my brain just keeps replaying it over and over again. But you come up with systems that you know over time it's it's like the the example we talked about before. It's like the best lesson is experience, right?

### ⚡ セクション 239

So, you know, it's just just experience it and learn from it as best as you can. >> Yeah. It made me think it makes me wonder if in the future there'll be a Gentic Workflows where there's sort of a an you know, an agent that's sort of over other agents and they're all working together and then one of them goes bad and the higher agent is going to be like, "All right, like before we tell the user like everything's falling apart, just remember like just one piece. I'm a component. I have components." >> Yeah.

### 🌟 セクション 240

>> You know? >> Yeah. I love that. One one thing that I've noticed with this and also a lot of other things this seems to be a common sort of um thing overlapping whether it's panic attacks or other issues like if there's like looping thoughts or anything like that depression I think also there's some components of that too this is the idea that um and also like the stoic philosophy I think kind of uh talks about this as well so if you think about you can have awareness and you have attention and those are two separate things and awareness we can't control right if somebody's like waving their their hand in your face, you can't choose to turn off the awareness of that. Uh or if there's a panic attack, you can't choose to turn off your awareness of that, right?

### 🎬 セクション 241

They can't flip a switch and like, "Oh, I no longer feel those whatever that is that's happening." But we do have control over the attention and where we place attention. In fact, a lot of people say for when you have an panic attack, they say, "Look around the room and focus on different colors. Find a red thing and a blue thing." And I think all it does is like it expands your um your eye sort of visibility, whatever that's called. Yeah. And then you you focus your attention elsewhere.

### 📋 セクション 242

Meditation is kind of the same way. So with a lot of this stuff, I think it's like realize you can't control your awareness. That's below your conscious control. You can control if you practice enough your attention where you put your attention and that I think is important and that is a solution I think to a lot of these maybe not the solution but certainly helps with a lot of these issues. So >> love that.

### ⭐ セクション 243

>> That's my my good. >> Yeah. No, I'm not a doctor. I don't tell you what the internet none of us know what we're talking about. >> This is a doctor.

### 📝 セクション 244

He said it. >> Please, please don't take anything you hear. You hear here with me. >> He doesn't want the liability. >> No liability.

Well, no. And seriously, we don't know what we're I mean, we're sharing our life experiences. >> Yeah, we're just And I think we should. Yeah, we should. But obviously, >> the financial professional doctor performance doesn't like all the disclaimers.

We we we've covered so many things and first is there anything else that that you think we should cover or you want to say to the people? >> I mean I think this was one of my favorite conversations ever. >> Thank you.

### 💭 セクション 248

Um you know it's I think what I would say is like >> you know I I really truly feel like this is one of the most special times to be alive as a human. And I think if you look at the arc of history, there have been some fundamental crazy moments that have shaped the future, the future, right? There have been these step changes. The the more I play with AI, the tools, the more I study the companies, the more I think about where we're going as a society. One of the things we didn't even talk about this podcast and hopefully we do at some point in the future about like the geopolitical implications of having AI and what does that mean for like like our the current power dynamics.

### 📌 セクション 249

That's another sort of canal worms that this opens up. But what what's true is that we have birthed this technology that's going to rewrite the rules of everything >> of everything. And so what does that mean? That means that there's going to be a lot of chaos and disruption, but more importantly, there's going to be a lot of open doors and opportunities and huge wins that humans are going to be able to benefit from. And given how humans usually um interact with the world, uh disruption comes a lot slower and faster than people expect.

### ✅ セクション 250

Meaning that the opportunity to capitalize on the on the disruption once you know the disruption is here is much longer than you think. But you have to act. You have to act. And so if you if you are somebody who is hungry to change their lives, to learn new skills, to build things, to experience really cool innovation, to learn more about themselves, to learn more about the world, to really just like get an idea of what how technology can change the world in the early innings. Just just go just literally just take as much time as you can and just play with every AI tool you can.

### 📚 セクション 251

Just start by asking questions. Use chat GPT, use Grock, use Claude Code, use Replet, use every these are like the beginner ones. I would say there's much more like uh cursor and codeex and all these other things you can use that are much more like coding specific and whatever. But just get familiar with what the potential could be for these tools and then try building things. Just literally try to build stuff uh if that's something that interests you.

### 🔖 セクション 252

But at the very least, I think it gives people and I think it will give a lot of people, you know, there's so many people that use Chat PT already, like the fastest growing freaking, you know, software ever. But I think I think there's still so much opportunity for so many people to sit down and just actually build things with these things and try to build something if that interests you. And if it doesn't, that's completely fine, too, right? That's completely fine, too. So, um, there's no better time than now.

### 🎨 セクション 253

And if it feels scary to forge your own path with this this early on in the game, that's a good thing cuz it's supposed to feel scary. If it doesn't feel scary, it's not worth doing. If it feels scary, it's worth doing. And the reason why it feels scary, it's because it's big >> and it's bigger than you. >> But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

### 🚀 セクション 254

So if if you're somebody who wants to really try that out, especially if you're young, I really encourage you to do so. obviously like you know do your own math on like what that means for you financially and stuff but if you've ever been hungry in getting something started there's literally no better time like if you're somebody who wants to get something done is build something you don't have any excuses do it now do it >> don't wait I agree that's a very positive message I think very inspirational message I I I agree 100% it's it's crazy to tell the young kids that are growing up it's like okay you just got here we know but this is like a once in a the only time in human history this is happening so maybe take advantage of But >> and I will give you a bigger one too, Wes. Like we we talk about like the the positive outcomes of of AI. This is how we have positive outcomes. We talked about what's the important variable here is the democratization and ensuring that as that this is as distributed as possible.

### ⚡ セクション 255

The only way for this to be truly distributed is for people to actually use it. >> So go out there and use it. >> Go out there and build like so like conversations like these I don't think like shouldn't be underestimated. This is how you build a positive AI future is by is by maximizing the number of people that build with it. >> This is how we build a >> more spread adoption will correlate with safety.

### 🌟 セクション 256

>> That's what I think 100%. >> Absolutely. >> Because because you are actually maximizing the chance that humanity's will will actually be captured in what we're building with AI. >> Yeah. >> Absolutely.

### 🎬 セクション 257

>> Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. >> I mean that was the anyways we should end it but like that that whole thought like in the past like why do you give why did the for founding fathers of America say like everybody can have a gun is because they were like we want to have a force as citizens that sort of matches the government force. But I guess the current equivalent of that is like everybody needs to have these very powerful tools for shaping the future not just >> a few people dictating it.

### 📋 セクション 258

Yeah. And the only way we guarantee that is by everybody possible actually using those tools and taking a slice of that for themselves. >> Protect your right to bear AI. Make a shirt. >> That's your next shirt, Wes.

### ⭐ セクション 259

Right now. Go in your merch store and make that sucker right now. >> We're on it. We're on it. >> You're right.

### 📝 セクション 260

That's what the founding fathers would say if they were redoing the Constitution. They'd be like every new It's the new building tool, the new weapons. It's everything. So, anyways, thank you so much for being here. will give I mean I'm sure everybody knows Farzad but we'll give links to the channel.

### 💡 セクション 261
