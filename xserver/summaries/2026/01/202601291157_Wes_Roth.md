## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Kimmy K 2.5 is out. >> So, here's a website that I found that looks, I gotta say, pretty cool. As I move the mouse, there's this smoke effect, etc. Pretty awesome. All right, now we can begin the experience.

### 📋 背景・概要

We click begin experience. And wow, look at that. Lead the future of brand storytelling. If we zoom out, that's looking really good. Hold to interact.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Interact with it. See all sorts of crazy flying nonsense. I mean, this is a website. So, the question is, can the open- source model Kim K2.5, can it replicate all of this? Let's uh let's find out.

### 📝 詳細説明

>> Is it pure hype or the real deal? Let's find out. In this video, we will see if this open- source model can create a website from video. We'll test its coding abilities. Hit thumbs up if you're not scared, and let's begin.

### 💡 実例・デモ

>> Kimmy K2.5 is out. It's been about 24 hours since its release. I didn't want to jump the gun and reported it on, you know, hour one of its release because often with these open source models, there's often some shenanigans that happens with the benchmarks. They do benchmark maxing. So, when it comes out, you're like, "Wow, the open source, the Chinese models, they're caught up to their Western counterparts, right?

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It just broke the entire industry." and they seem impressive at first, but then a few weeks go by, a few months go by and you just realize that you're not using it as much as the good old Claude and Chipt Gro Gemini etc. And you can see that on Open Router AI. So notice so this is kind of the total market share by tokens that are being used with these different model providers. Google is number one with one trillion tokens almost a quarter of the total sort of token usage. then Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and then in the number five spot, we see the first Chinese open source sort of company, Deepseek.

### 🎯 応用例

But as you'll see, this is kind of one of the first models where people are saying that this is not really happening here. It does seem to be a lot closer to what it claims to be. It also has a new mode that it's calling agent swarm. It's still in beta, but it's self-directed agents working in parallel at scale. So this model can launch up to 100 sub agents that are running in parallel conducting tasks on its behalf.

### 💭 考察

Now we knew in theory that this was coming and we saw a lot of different sort of approaches to creating this agentic swarm and we are seeing it here at a fairly large scale. So up to 100 sub aents 1500 tool calls 4.5 times faster compared with single agent setup. We're not going to spend too much time on these benchmarks, but notice that at first glance, they look very, very solid, very high on the SU bench. It got a 50.2 on humanity's last exam. And everything else across the board, it's looking very good, very high comparable to the leaders in the space, OpenI, Anthropic, and Gemini.

### 📌 まとめ

And on humanity's last exam, I think this is the top score right now for a a single model. Zoom federated AI, if you recall that whole story, Zoom. Yes, that Zoom the teley conferencing software they have the highest score sitting at 53%. But that's a federated score. So they have tons of different models working together.

### ✅ 結論

That's how they got that score. It's all rather odd. Let's just leave it at that. But this is the top score for a single model. And also commun 2.5 is saying it's the strongest open source model to date for coding, specifically coding with vision.

### 📚 追加情報

So if you take a look at this, you give it an image of a website for example, it's able to replicate that style. I've tested it with this particular approach. I'll show you what happened with it later. Here's another example. So, as you can see here, very kind of good visual styles it's able to reproduce.

### 🔖 補足

So, certainly the front end coding experience is impressive. Here's two more examples. I mean, definitely looking this is looking great. I got to say one very interesting thing here is that you're able to give it video and it's able to code from video. So, here's an example of K2.5 reconstructing a website from a video.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, this is on the left is a video, a recording of a website. And Kimy's output on the right based on just that video. Looking, I got to say, pretty good. Not quite as good and detailed as the original, but it's close. It's it's very close.

### 🚀 セクション 14

To understand why Kim K 2.5 is special, here's Nathan Leen's. though he's saying that on benchmarks often times these Chinese models they look really good they're very close on benchmarks to their western counterparts however when you actually start using them they tend to fall flat for the actual day-to-day tasks for those weird kind of strange use cases that that we all have those kind of custom things and this has been a problem he even posted this short clip kind of talking about why these benchmarks especially by some companies it seems like he's specifically calling out some of the Chinese companies as well as of course Meta and Llama 4. Why they're not really to be trusted. Take a quick listen. Next one.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Are people being misled by benchmaxing? I do think benchmaxing is probably misleading to at least some degree. Um, and I would go back to the Chinese models, which I talked about last time, being like significantly worse on just a very random multimodal task than all of the leading western models as a kind of leading indicator of how much benchmaxing might be misleading us more generally. But note, as he says here, even though he said all that that he said recently, he's saying, "Kim K 2.5 changes that on the same task that other Chinese models badly failed. matches a Gemini 3 and falls just short of Opus 4.5.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, this is why we should be maybe paying a little bit more attention to these benchmarks because before they were kind of a distorted view of reality, at least some companies that engaged in benchmaxing would kind of distort reality, so to speak. But now with Kim K 2.5, we're seeing even that gap closing. This is an open- source model out of China that is by all accounts truly is very close to its western counterparts and it being open source at the same time. Kim K2 also lands at the number one spot on the EQ bench. EQ's emotional intelligent benchmarks for LM.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So this is creative writing various emotional or more abstract things it has to deal with. And it got a 1600 ELO score beating out GPT 5.203 203 Gemini 3 Pro Preview and pretty much everything else. In Creative Writing, it's in second place, second to only Claude Opus 4.5. They're one point apart, so very, very close. And it's pretty solid across the board.

### 📋 セクション 18

Doesn't have too many weaknesses. Be a great open source model to use for creative writing. The easiest way to try out Kimmy K2.5 is to just go to kimmy.com. You do have to log in and it gives you a few credits that you can use here. You can use the instant, the thinking, and the agent.

### ⭐ セクション 19

The agent swarm, you can't without having some credits. Now, I used the agent mode to see if I could build a website based on just some screenshots of this website. So, here are some screenshots of some e-commerce store that I found. Just kind of like the layout and the overall theme. It's pretty cool.

### 📝 セクション 20

I said, build a website like this for cat accessories, which it went on to do. So, we have the preview version one and all the files we need to actually launch that website. Let's take a look. This is what it looks like. Pretty good.

### 💡 セクション 21

You got kind of like that hovering effect. It called it Meow Studios Premium Cat Accessories. So, definitely is looking pretty good. Kind of exactly what we wanted. You have the new stuff that pops into view.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It's meant to be a mobile view. So, let me tighten up a little bit. So, here we go. We got a leather collar, doughnut bed, etc., etc. Pause and play.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, I mean, it definitely captured that same feel that we were going for. It's got the images pretty pretty good. A lot of the links are not fully fleshed out, but it's a great great starting point. So, Kilo Code is offering Kimmy K2.5 for free for one week on Kilo Code. So, the simplest way of doing that is go into your VS Code extensions and search for Kilo Code.

### 💭 セクション 24

Install Kilo Code and you're good to go. By the way, it says, "Do you trust this publisher?" I'm going to click yes. But it brings up a good question. How do you know who to trust? One great place that a lot of people trust is openouter.ai.

### 📌 セクション 25

This is a website that allows developers and users to kind of get an access to the aggregate information about all of the LMS and other AI assistant coding tools. So, as you can see here, they're showing you kind of the LM leaderboard by token usage. So, notice that Cloud Sonic 4.5 is the highest followed by Gemini 3 flash preview croc code fast one. Now, here the cheaper ones are going to be favored, right? So, it's a balance between good and cheap.

### ✅ セクション 26

They're probably going to be near the top of this particular leaderboard. If you're investing in any of these things, whether it's publicly or otherwise, this is an interesting thing to take a look at. This is a market share. So basically on Open Router, the token share by model author. Notice it's Google at around 25%, then anthropic in place number two, 17%, OpenAI around 14%, and then XAI at around 13%.

### 📚 セクション 27

And again, that's still by tokens. Grocode fast one is number one for programming. So this is if we break it up into categories, but here's the relevant piece. This is the top apps. So this is the largest public apps.

### 🔖 セクション 28

They're opting into usage tracking on open router. So again, this is of course not every single model, but for today and for models that opted in, kilo code is number one. Notice cloth code is number six. And if we look for this month again, kilo code is number one. Once you have the kilo code extension here, you can select the model and notice here moonshot.Ai Kimmy K2.5 is free.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And then head to kilo.ai. AI. So, this video is not sponsored by Kilo Code, although I wouldn't mind them sponsoring me because it's it's a good tool. Notice it's number one on Product Hunt today. So, we're going to click sign up.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You can install it just within the VS Code. So, you can install it in VS Code like this as well. Or if the screen you can sign in or sign up using Google, GitHub, GitLab, LinkedIn, email, whatever. I'm going to Google in. If you can't select the model because it says select API configuration, then go here to the top, click on settings, little gear icon, click on login at kilo code.

### ⚡ セクション 31

It'll give you a link or a QR code, whatever. You have to be logged in to the website into your kilo code account. It'll give you an authorization code. Click authorize to authorize that VS Code instance, that machine to be able to run Kilo code on it. And it should say Kilo code successfully configured.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And then now you should be able to run Moonshot Kimmy K2. And if you scroll down here, you can actually see the model reasoning effort. I've asked it to create a game like Melvore Idol and to kind of reimagined what the 2.0 version would look like. So, we'll see if it's able to create something like that with HTML. And so, here's what it created.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, we got our inventory, our health system, player stats. This is pretty good. Let's see. Mining. We can start mining stone.

### 📋 セクション 34

This is terrific. Um, so far so good. So, we're mining stone. Notice our XP is going up. This was one shot.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So, one prompt and it returns with this. So far, it's terrific. You can click on this. This one stops. This one continues.

### 📝 セクション 36

Shows the exact XP that you're getting. Let's make sure it's going into our inventory. It is. Look at that. We have various ores that are in our inventory.

### 💡 セクション 37

And we can use those ores to do smithing. Bronze bars. Looks like we need one copper, one tin. This is pretty impressive, I got to say. Wood cutting.

### 🔧 セクション 38

We can chop some trees down. We have a shop to buy various upgrades. This is great. And of course, combat. Let's attack and see what happens.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, for the tax, it looks like we have to autoclick. There's no auto combat, but not bad. So, the combat system, it needs some work, but everything is here. Like, the basics are here. Here's the equipment, so we can equip it on its first shot, first attempt.

### 💭 セクション 40

I got to say, it built the entire sort of base layer for this game, and we can start building on top of it. So, coding looks pretty solid just with this one quick test. So, here's a website that I found that looks, I gotta say, pretty cool. As I move the mouse, there's this smoke effect, etc. Pretty awesome.

### 📌 セクション 41

All right. Now, we can begin the experience. We click begin experience. And wow, look at that. Lead the future of brand storytelling.

### ✅ セクション 42

If we zoom out, that's looking really good. Hold to interact. Can interact with it. See all sorts of crazy flying nonsense. I mean this is a website.

### 📚 セクション 43

So the question is can the open- source model Kim K2.5 can it replicate all of this? Let's uh let's find out. All right. So I uploaded that video. It's almost 20 megabytes and after it got done parsing it, we're going to say recreate the website from this video.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Let's go. All right. So let's see how well it did here. So, first and foremost, there's no smoke effect from the cursor, which is not quite what the previous website had, but let's see. We'll click begin experience, and the eyes appear.

### 🎨 セクション 45

They're not quite as realistic, but pretty good for, you know, worked I think about for 10 or 15 minutes. Here's our little lion that if I click, it goes completely crazy. It's It's close. It's kind of a low res version of of what we've seen. I did not expect it to capture it perfectly because that was quite a highlevel ad advanced website, but I I gotta say it did kind of capture the the essence of it, a a low res essence, if you will.

### 🚀 セクション 46

I haven't done too many of these where it's a video to website, but you know, on my first kind of attempt of this, it looks pretty good, pretty interesting. So, definitely this deserves a lot more testing because it's I haven't seen this before. This is pretty interesting. Communicate 2.5 also seems like it does pretty well on the design arena beating out Gemini 3 Pro preview, Cloud Opus 4.5, etc. So definitely pretty strong performance across the board.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Again, this is an opensource model and by the looks of it. Again, it's only been out for less than 24 hours at this point, I believe. By all measures, it's a strong, capable, open- source model. Now, time will tell, of course, how well it performs. Will people start using it for coding tasks for a lot of the other tasks that we all use it for for creative writing?

### 🌟 セクション 48

So far, notice Kimmy is nowhere on the leaderboard for the market share or I guess it would be Moonshot the company, but we're not seeing it on here out of the Chinese models. So, we're seeing in Deep Seek Quen. And then seventh place, we have Zia Omi. Eight is Mistral AI, which is a a French company. Number nine is ZAI.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And 10 is all the other ones holding just under 10% total market share. Now, when somebody comes out of nowhere and is amazing at a particular task, you see it kind of like what happened here with XAI, right? So, they came out with the coding fast one model and you see how before at some point had just a a tiny slither of the market share and then boom, it just explodes and and now it's holding about just under 13%. At the peak here, it was holding 40% I I think that's the peak, 40% of the total market share. So if Kim K 2.5 lives up to the hype, you know, specifically for, you know, the coding category, you're probably going to see a a pretty big explosion like that where it starts taking over the market share, getting used a lot more.

### 📋 セクション 50

It's priced very competitively compared to the things it's being, you know, compared to like cloud open 4.5. So keep an eye on this chart. Do we have a a new open- source contender that's going to take maybe one of the number five spots? I mean, DeepSec is currently in the fifth spot. Are we going to see Moonshot overshadow Deep Seek and maybe climb even closer to the number one spot?

### ⭐ セクション 51

Well, we'll see. It's It's a little bit too early to make that decision. Also, keep in mind that we're still expecting that new Deep Seek release to come out of nowhere and potentially leaprog a lot of these models. We're also seeing some chatter, some rumors about Gemini 3.5 called the Snow Bunny. Don't necessarily believe this.

### 📝 セクション 52

This is, you know, to be taken with a grain of salt. oftentimes there's tons of misinformation before these models get released, but it does seem that Google Deep Mine is testing some new models. And the Snow Bunny, I believe, is one of those code names that is legitimately a Gemini model. Are any of these claims real? It's hard to tell, but maybe it is kind of time for Gemini to to drop their latest models.

### 💡 セクション 53

It does seem like they're obviously cooking up something in the background. So, we're going to be seeing a lot of new stuff from OpenAI, from DeepSeek, from Google Deep Mine. Of course, Grock is a lot of people are talking about Grock 4.2 that is doing incredibly well with certain financial stuff as well as certain mathematical stuff, but we are not expecting that one to be as good as something that's already available like Claude Code with Claude Opus 4.5. That's according to Elon. He's saying Enthropic really cooked up something special with that model.

### 🔧 セクション 54

But yeah, stay tuned. The competition is heating up, especially with things like Claudebot, which was renamed to Moltbot, which is a completely open-source agent kind of based somewhat on Claude Code, but with some new functionality in memory and stuff like that as well, which has been really, really good. I mean, what if at some point in some point soon we'll get to the point where we're going to be able to see an open source harness like that running on a Mac Mini or on some virtual private server and running, you know, locally, meaning it's running an ondevice open- source model like a Kimmy K 2.5 or the latest Deepseek. I think things are going to get interesting. So stay tuned.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Thank you for tuning in and I'll see you in the next one. And if you've tested out the Kimi model, definitely let me know down below.
