## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So to get you hooked on the video, I just want to show you what Claude code can do on X now. So this is kind of the training I've been doing lately. So I'm just going to say to Claude Code here, open up X.com, research some top post on Cloud Code from the last 24 hours. Create a meme about this and post it. So we're just going to put this into Claude Code here now.

### 📋 背景・概要

And you can kind of see already in the background. This is going to open up our X. You can see we are logged in on our test account here. And if we bring claude back up, you can see it's writing these commands all the time, doing some coding, writing some code, and it's just going to maneuver claude code on no X here on cloud code. You can see it put claude code into the top search here.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And it's going to look up different post that has been yeah, just posted lately on X here. And we're going to use this to create a meme. And we're going to post this meme. So I'm going to try to just keep this in real time. I don't know how long it's going to take.

### 📝 詳細説明

Uh, but now it's just going to keep looking at X here to find information. I think we can speed this up a bit. So, I'm going to take you back when Claude Code has kind of done its research. Okay, I guess it's looking up more. It switched to latest here.

### 💡 実例・デモ

You can see that. So, it went from top to latest on this keyword cloud code. So, yeah, I'm just going to wait a bit until it's ready to start posting. Okay, as you can see, I kind of find this post here. How my code base written entirely with cloud code runs.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And it's kind of this meme here and it says that's the vibe icotic track roller coaster visual showing how Clo runs. So it's going to check some comments to understand the sentiment. So now it's kind of looking at the comments on this post. Okay. So now it's going to click on compose.

### 🎯 応用例

That's what we want to see. And you can see now it's kind of in the compost field. And let me see here now what it's going to do. Okay, so it looks like it's decided actually to do an image here. So this is going to send to create an image or like a meme from Nana Pro and it's going to probably just upload this image.

### 💭 考察

Create a text and send it. Let's see. Okay, so we got the image. Now it's probably going to try to upload this. It called it claude meme.png.

### 📌 まとめ

So it's going to do a new compose and hopefully now it's just going to upload image. add the text and let's see what happens. Okay, so you can see it uploaded the image. Perfect. Uh maybe not the best.

### ✅ 結論

I just wanted to center a div. Uh let's see if it's going to add some text here and post it. Yeah, you can see it added the text 20 minutes later. And you can see in the background here, it's doing all this. Uh let's see if it's just going to hit post.

### 📚 追加情報

And that should be pretty much it. Yeah, and that was posted, right? So, you can see I got a trained up cloud code on these skills uh how to use X now autonomously. We can do research and everything. So, in this video, I just wanted to show you uh a bit how I kind of we want to train a new skill for our X agent and yeah, let's just see what happens.

### 🔖 補足

So, the way I've been doing this is pretty straightforward actually. Uh, I just started by kind of connecting Cloud Code to my Chrome browser. And from there in Cloud Code, we just go to a page where we kind of want to learn some skills, how to navigate it. We set some goals. Maybe that could be like we did posting a meme or like a post on X.

### 🎨 セクション 13

That could be like something a goal we want to achieve. Then we just iterate, attempt, retry, redefine until we kind of have the workflow to get that exact skill honed in, right? And when it's working, we just update our skills.m MD page and repeat it. So every time we kind of want to do that skill again, we have the steps to do this in our skills MD file. So that is basically what I'm doing.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And let's say we did that post. Next, now we want to do something else. So the next thing we're going to do now is try to train uh our cloud code X agent to when we find a post with a video we want to learn to how we can understand this video to make a comment or kind of yeah do other things with that video we find on X. So let me go through kind of uh together how I kind of do that. So let's just start in kind of a fresh uh cloud code instance here now.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, uh, I had this post here that contains a video. So, I'm just going to say to Cloudco, go, uh, there. So, hopefully now we're just going to go to this page, right? And I kind of also want to just, uh, read your X skills. So, we kind of are up to date on what kind of skills we already have tried.

### 🌟 セクション 16

You can see we have information about the video. We took a screenshot. We kind of read everything about the DOM here and we kind of know what's happening. So what I want to kind of teach the agent now is how we can do some video understanding because there is a lot of videos on X, right? So I'm going to do a prompt here and uh kind of tell it how it could understand videos.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So I'm just going to say next skill we want to learn is video understanding. First step is to get the video into our CVD for analysis. Try to do that. So now I just I'm just going to kind of challenge cloud code here to find a way to get the video from this post uh on X here. So it's going to try to use the YTDLP and it's going to put in this and let's see if we can download the video.

### 📋 セクション 18

Yeah, that was super easy, right? So you can see we downloaded the video from this post. So let me just double check that we have it. And if you go in here, you can see yeah, we got the video, right? So, there's no sound here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

This makes it a bit more interesting. Uh, but I have like a trick we can do to kind of understand the video. So, let's say now that we have this. I'm just going to say, uh, good job. Uh, always check if video has audio.

### 📝 セクション 20

Do that. Now, uh, use FFmpeg. So, we can just probe it, right? to see if the video we got has some audio or something. If it doesn't have audio, we have to choose a different skill.

### 💡 セクション 21

If it has audio, we can do it a bit more easy, right? So, it's going to check it's no audio. Okay. So, for that, yeah, ready to extract frame for visual analysis when you want. So, that is the skill we want to learn.

### 🔧 セクション 22

We want to use uh frames from the video to kind of get the point of this, right? So, let's do uh extraction. Let's do one frame each uh five seconds just for fun. Now, it doesn't really matter too much. That's just going to be three frames, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

Uh or we can do it 3 seconds, something like that. Just some simple stuff. So, we're going to take the video, we're going to extract the frames, we're going to analy analyze the frames, and we're going to figure out what the video is about. So, after that, we're going to find a video with audio and we're going to do something else. So, you can see we are reading all the frames we extracted and let's see what we kind of get back here now because everything comes down to claw code here getting the context from the video it found on X.

### 💭 セクション 24

So, we can do something else with it, right? So you can see here now we're going to look at each frame. Uh you can see it's typing run snake full prompt what is happening. So basically the summary is demo shows cloud code being used as a game engine. User prompts cloud code to run a snake game fully playable.

### 📌 セクション 25

Uh but impressive proof of concept. So yeah we kind of got some video understanding there. So that's not too bad. So I'm going to say update your skills MD file um on how to understand video without uh audio also how to download it from x.com. Okay, so this is basically the the things I'll be doing.

### ✅ セクション 26

I'll be just testing different things out, updating my skills MD when something works. And now we have it. So we can kind of save that skill to our agent so we can do yeah the same thing next time we need it even autonomously because it already knows how to do it. So you can see it kind of updated uh its skills now and that's pretty good. So I want to do one more thing.

### 📚 セクション 27

So I'm going to find a video that includes audio. So now I found this uh Greg Eisenberg 31 minute video on cloud code here. Just a random post. So I'm just going to say go to this post and now we're going to find a way to actually understand video with uh audio. I think that's a bit maybe easier to be honest.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So we navigated to this and I'm just going to say give it an instruction here. Yeah, I'm just going to stop this. So basically the instructions I'm going to say to CL Claude now is uh this is a video with audio uses meg to get the MP3 audio from the video. Then we're going to use like a local whisper model or something just a base model to get the transcription from the audio and so we kind of get the full understanding of the context of the video. We will got not get the images but I think in this case it's fine just remove the audio file but keep the context from the video.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So let's see how Claude is going to solve this now and if we get it to work first time. Again, we're just going to update our skills MD page. So, you can see Claude goes for the download route again. So, it's going to download this video from X. It's going to turn it into MP3 file, uh, extract the audio, uh, transcribe the audio with Whisper, and hopefully get this in, um, yeah, a text file or something.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And then we have all the information. So, I'm just going to let this run a while. I'm going to take you back when we have something here. Okay. So, you can see now we have downloaded video to our machine.

### ⚡ セクション 31

That's good. Now, we're just going to extract the audio. We're going to keep using uh ffmpeg, right? Okay. So, we loaded up the whisper claw model base.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Perfect. And we're going to put it out in a text format. So, I'm just going to accept that. Uh, of course, that looking pretty good. And hopefully now we can get everything from that video into text format.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, the cloud code can use that as context when it's using research or whatever you want to set up your agent to do. And what is cool is we can run this cloud code in like a dangerously skip permissions mode and everything will be run autonomous and we can do even in parallel controlling different versions. So let's just see what we end up here after the transcription and yeah that should basically be us learning a new skill uh video understanding right okay so you can see now we kind of have done the transcription we have the cloud code audio.txt txt and hopefully this contains all the information from the video. Right, we removed the MP3 files as we called upon and this workflow is looking pretty good. So, of course, I'm going to update this skill.

### 📋 セクション 34

But before we do that, uh I wanted to create an index.html so we can get kind of a nice overview of everything that was from the video. So, I'm just going to say create an index.html with a nice simple to understand overview from the takeaways. launch it in browser for me. So hopefully now cloud code just going to write some HTML code launch it in the browser and we can kind of read uh the transformed the derivative of the video we just watched on XR. Okay, so the code is done now.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Basically all we have to do is launch this and here we have it. Claude code crash course planning is everything. Don't use Ralph if you're new. Don't obsess over MCP context management have Audacity recommended workflows and yeah that was basically everything we yeah we link back to the source Greg Eisenberg and super easy way to do this so yeah that is a new skill so I'm just going to say great update skill uh on video with audio right so we kind of get this workflow go locked in here with the FFmpeg and the Whisper. So yeah, that is how I've been training up my X skills.

### 📝 セクション 36

So I'm just keep going to keep expanding on this till I kind of if I run into something it can't do. We're going to work a bit on it. Try different things, elements, DOM, everything until we figure it out. And then we're just going to update the skill. So next time we do it, it's good to go.

### 💡 セクション 37

So I'm just going to say go to skills MDA.store. So, this is something I kind of cooked up today. So, I have some plans on uh yeah, creating like a simple store where you can um buy different skills. I'm going to train up. So, this is just a meme for now, right?

### 🔧 セクション 38

But it is working if you really want this, right? Uh because uh I'm going to if you click on this now you can see uh we get tak if you pay here now you just get uh you download the skills file but uh of course this is a bit shady now but this is a meme I've created so I'm going to probably work a bit more on it and of course you should be really careful with places where you just download a file uh upon buying it. Uh, but I'm going to keep uh uploading my skills here just to see just for fun. So, it's skills md.store if you really want it. Uh, I would advise to wait a bit maybe uh but you will get the x.com skill to work if you'd buy it today.

### 🎯 セクション 39

But I'm going to keep updating here and yeah, make it a bit more transparent maybe after uh after a while. So, it's skills md.store, okay, if you want to check it out. So, yeah. Um, basically I think this was what I wanted to showcase today. So, I've been having so much fun with this and I did a bunch of other things.

### 💭 セクション 40

I have Gmail. I've set up like some eBay workflow where Cloud Code does research and find good product for me at a good price. And basically, I've been super impressed how well it tackles to navigate these pages. So, for me, this been kind of like a new revelation in kind of computer use. And I think this is just the beginning.

### 📌 セクション 41

So I'm going to keep iterating on this uh updating my skills uh for cold code, how to navigate on pages, and I'll probably do another video if this gets like 500 likes or something. So if you like this, click a like on the video, maybe subscribe and share it. So yeah, that was it for today. Hope you hope this gave you some inspiration. Yeah.

### ✅ セクション 42

And I'll see you again
