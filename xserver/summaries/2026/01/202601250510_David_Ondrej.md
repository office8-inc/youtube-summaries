## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

If you're in business, you're always in business. Things are always happening. It doesn't matter if you're in your office or if you're on a ski slope. So, if you're trying to build an AI startup, just be prepared for constant problem solving. And just don't take it personally because, you know, I had a call with my main dev and his side project just raised $2 million, which means that in about a month, I'm going to be like losing my main developer.

### 📋 背景・概要

And yeah, it's just a normal day in business, you know, but you cannot take these things personally. You have to adapt to them and make decisions on the move. If I was a beginner entrepreneur, I would probably get a headache from this, but I literally don't care. It is what it is. Obviously, it's it's unlucky losing such a good developer, but then again, his project raised 2 million, so I cannot really match that with a salary.
