## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I gave an AI a camera for eyes, wheels for legs, and sent it into the forest alone. The brain, well, it's running clog code on a Raspberry Pi. The camera captures a frame, sends it to clog code, and then it decides which direction it's going to go in all over 4G. Yeah, iteration was critical. At first, it got stuck on roots, tipped over on slopes, and just broke.

### 📋 背景・概要

But using claw code, I could iterate fast, fix what wasn't working, add logic to avoid obstacles, etc. But while it was navigating, it was also doing something I didn't expect. It was paying attention. >> Ooh, look at this massive tree right in front of me. The path curves around it through all these crunchy leaves and snow patches.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

>> Claude described a frozen puzzle as a mirror the forest made for itself. Damn bars. It said, >> "No shadows ever repeat the same shape, even when the wind pauses." >> I walked past all of this, didn't notice any of it. In the end, I used Cloud Code to help itself navigate nature, but instead, Cloud Code helped me see the nature that I was missing. I thought this was supposed to be a coding video.
