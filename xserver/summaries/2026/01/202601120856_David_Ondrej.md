## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

In this video, I'll show you eight insane use cases for Agent Zero. AgentZero is an open- source AI agent with full access to the Linux terminal, which means it can do literally anything. The eight use cases I'm about to show you save me hours every single week, both in my business and in my personal life. Agent Zero can do accounting, coding, video editing, file manipulation, and even hacking. But I do have to warn you though, Agent Zero is very powerful.

### 📋 背景・概要

It'll do whatever you tell it to do. So, make sure to use it ethically. Now, in order to use Agent Zero, we need Docker. And the easiest way to use Docker is to install Docker Desktop. So, go to Google, type in Docker Desktop, click on the first link, and then click download Docker Desktop and select your operating system.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Once you install Docker Desktop, it should look something like this. Just make sure to select the personal plan, which is completely free. Now, the next step is crucial, so pay attention. When you have Docker Desktop open, go to the search bar at the top and put in this exact string. I'm going to put it below the video, so you can just copy it.

### 📝 詳細説明

But this is the official Agent Zero Docker image. Just make sure you have the latest version selected and then click on pull. Then if you go onto the left inside of Docker Desktop and click on images, you should see the Agent Zero image right here. Now the reason why Agent Zero is over 5 GB is that it includes a full operating system and a lot of software pre-installed. This is what makes Agent Zero so powerful.

### 💡 実例・デモ

It can literally do anything you can do in Linux. But it's safe because it runs inside of a Docker container. And because of the Docker container, Agent Zero cannot mess up anything on your computer. It's an isolated environment. Now once the image finishes downloading, click on the run button right here, run.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Then we go into the optional settings. So this wants to run a new Docker container. So click on optional settings. Now the only thing you need to do here in optional settings is to put the number zero into the 80 TCP port. That's it.

### 🎯 応用例

We don't need to change anything else. Just make sure you put zero in the port 80 and then click on run. This will start agent zero in a new Docker container and will give us a link to use it on local host. So agent zero runs completely locally. It isn't sending data anywhere.

### 💭 考察

Everything you do inside of Agent Zero stays on your machine. So, it's completely secure, completely private, and the code is fully open source on GitHub. So, if you want, you can go ahead and inspect it. And there we go. Agent Zero is finished loading.

### 📌 まとめ

Now, it gives you some links. But this is the link we need to click. Local host 55,000. This is the port that was assigned. And if you click on it, here you go.

### ✅ 結論

Now, there are a lot of things agent zero can do, but first, let's click on new chat. And let's try sending new message, which should result in an error. There we go. That's because we haven't set up the API key. So, let's go to the settings.

### 📚 追加情報

So if you go to the left, click on agent settings, agent config. Scroll down a bit into the chat model. Here we can select chat model provider. And as you can see, you can select open router, open AI, mistrol, lm studio, hugging face, grock, deepsee, basically any provider out there. You can even select Olama and run your own models locally on your machine.

### 🔖 補足

That way no data ever leaves your device. But if you want to use the most powerful models, then you can use something like open router, which offers every single model out there, which is what I'm going to show you now. How to use open router. That way we can use the latest and greatest models inside of agent zero. Now to set up open router just go to open router.ai and then we need to select the model.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So by default it's GP4.1 but there are better models out there namely cloth opus 4.5. I think right now this is the best model in the world. So let's copy this name. Go back to agent zero and replace it here. Boom.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Let's click on save. But there is one more thing we have to do. We have to set the API key. So again let's go to settings on the left here. We need to go to external services.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So select external services at the top. Click on API keys and scroll down until we find open router. There we go. Open router. So here we need to place the open router API key.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So let's go back to open router. Go to top right. Make sure you create an account. Takes like 30 seconds. Super easy.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So go to top right and click on keys. This will bring you to your API key section. If you don't have anything here, don't worry. Just click on create API key. I'm going to name it agent zero testing.

### 📋 セクション 18

Give it some limit like 20 bucks. That way if your API key gets leaked, you will not lose more than the limit. Now again do not share your API keys with anybody. Treat them as passwords. I'm going to revoke this key before uploading this video.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So click on copy go back to agent zero and again make sure in opener here paste it in and save. Now if we go to top left and create a new chat and type in hey we should no longer get this error and we should actually get a response from agent zero. There we go. Agent zero is responding. Beautiful.

### 📝 セクション 20

So now we're using Cloud Opus 4.5, the best model in the world with Agent Zero that runs completely locally, allowing us to explore some insane use cases, which is exactly what I'm going to show you right now. The first use case I'm going to show you is file manipulation. So Agent Zero can transform different file formats or work with hundreds of files at once. It's actually pretty impressive. So I'm going to have a PSD file here, which is from Photoshop, and I'm going to ask it to extract all layers as PNG files.

### 💡 セクション 21

Now, normally you would have to open Photoshop, save each of these separately. it would be like a 5 to 10 minute process, right? With agent zero, it's just a single prompt. So, I just uploaded it here. And now what it does is it uses the code execution tool to run some Linux commands.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And again, you don't even know have to know these libraries. The agent knows what to do. It has full access to Linux, but the Linux runs in the Docker container. So, it cannot harm your computer. This is the key difference between agent zero, Codex, and CL code.

### 🎯 セクション 23

These agents run on your computer, so they can delete your files. They can mess stuff up. Agent zero runs in a docker where it can do anything which gives it its own operating system but it cannot mess up your computer. And just like that in a matter of 20 seconds we have four different layers. So if you look at the original file this is what it looks like.

### 💭 セクション 24

It's a thumbnail for one of my other videos. And again this is a PSD file. So this is from Photoshop. And these layers should be separate. So let me save these.

### 📌 セクション 25

Boom. So it should be just the background. Open that up. There we go. Just the white background.

### ✅ セクション 26

Let's look at the second one. Okay. So here we have a slight issue. You can see there are spaces in the name because that's my bad. That's how I name it in Photoshop.

### 📚 セクション 27

So, I'm going to say make sure to remove the spaces from the layer names. Boom. Uses a tool. And again, Agent Zero has unlimited tools. So, unlike other AI agents where you have to build new tools for them, Agent Zero has access to every single Linux library ever created.

### 🔖 セクション 28

There's like millions of those, right? So, let's look at another layer here. There we go. Let's open this up. There we go.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Here we have the text. So, this is the text from the thumbnail isolated. Let's look at the rectangle. Let's save that. You have the rectangle.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You know, you can see the background behind the text. And now this file. Boom. Here's the NA10 agent node which we use right here. So, literally something that would take you at least 10 minutes to do manually.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Agent Zero did it in two prompts in like a matter of 40 seconds. And this is just the beginning. The use cases later in the video get way more impressive. Now, let me show you another use case where agent zero performs way better than close code. In fact, close code failed to do this task which I'm going to show you right now.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, I have a PDF file. This is my personal bank statement from December. The issue is that when I tried uploading this into one accounting software, it was more than 20 pages. It's 24 pages. So I tried giving it to cloth code which completely failed splitting it in two halves.

### 🎬 セクション 33

But Agent Zero did it on the first try. So let me show you. I'm just going to drag the file into agent zero and say split this into two separate PDF files perfectly in half. Okay. Boom.

### 📋 セクション 34

I'm going to send this off. Then I'm going to open the terminal. I'm going to type in cloth to start cloth code. All right. It's asking me if I want to improve.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I'm not going to be sending more data into Entropic. I'm going to say in this folder, find the PDF file. And then I'm going to say the exact same prompt. Boom. Split this into two separate PDF files perfectly in half.

### 📝 セクション 36

Enter. Now, agent zero is already done because it started first. But let's see if Cloud Cool can do it because when I tried this two days ago, it completely failed. Okay, so it found the file. Good.

### 💡 セクション 37

It's going to try to split it with PDF. It's a Python library. It's asking me for permission, which that's another issue. Agent Zero doesn't need to do that because it has full access to its own operating system. It doesn't need to ask me for permission.

### 🔧 セクション 38

But code does. So let's give close permission. Okay. Boom. Error.

### 🎯 セクション 39

All right. Let's see if it fixes it. Okay. It first wants to install PI PDF. All right.

### 💭 セクション 40

It needs another permission. Enter. Another error. Agent zero is already done. You know, agent zero did it on the first try.

### 📌 セクション 41

No issues. All right. Let's see if cloud code. We're going to give it one more shot. Let me try a different approach.

### ✅ セクション 42

All right. So, it writes literally custom Python command user flag blah blah blah. Let's proceed. and it wants another permission. Now, notice how much time I've already spent here.

### 📚 セクション 43

You know, in Cloudco, we have to give it permission every single time because it's running some risky commands. Okay, so it seems like it managed to do it this time. It only ran into like two errors and needed three different permissions and it only took like five times longer than agent zero, but it managed to do it in these two parts. But agent zero is already done. So, if we click on these halves, we can save them into the same folder.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Boom. There it is. Let me open this up. We might need to blur all of this because this is my actual bank account. But yeah, so this is going to be blurred, but you can see that it's 12 pages at the top.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Right here, you can see this 12 pages. There's the original file. You can see that it's 24 pages right here at the top. You can see 24. So even a simple task like this would take me a lot of time because I don't know how to split in PDF.

### 🚀 セクション 46

You know, I could probably figure it out in half an hour. But agent zero can do it in 20 seconds. While cloth code needed multiple permissions, ran into two different errors, and last time I tried it, it failed. So here you can see the power of Agent Zero having the full operating system and access to all of the Linux commands that exist. Now the second type of use cases that Agent Zero can do revolve around hacking or penetration testing.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So again, I'm not your lawyer. Do not do what I'm showing. It's all for educational purposes. Okay? Make sure to be ethical and be good.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So here I have a password protected zip folder. Okay? And let's say I don't know the password to this, but I really want to get inside of the zip folder. Well, guess what? I'm going to put it into agent zero and I'm going to say crack this password protected zip folder.

### 🎬 セクション 49

I forgot the password so I need you to brute force it. Boom. And agent zero will do its thing and hopefully help us open this zip folder. So again it's installs Kali Linux I think runs some packages some cracking tools. I don't know if you guys are in cyber security or if you're hackers you probably know what it's doing.

### 📋 セクション 50

I have no clue. But since I'm using Agent Zero, I can just uh let it cook, let it do its thing, and see how long it takes to crack this password. It's trying different things. It's doing John the Ripper. It's doing dictionary attack.

### ⭐ セクション 51

It's doing brute force with common password patterns. It's literally approaching this like a senior cyber security professional would. It knows what order of actions to take. It knows what to do to crack this in as short amount of time as possible. All right, so it took a few minutes, but here we are.

### 📝 セクション 52

It says the zip folder is cracked. Here's the password. Summer 24. So, it's not like one, two, three letters. This is like what?

### 💡 セクション 53

10 letters. Like, some of you guys have passwords weaker than this. Okay? It's not like 30 characters, but it's a standard password. So, it it took a few minutes.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Obviously, the longer the password, the longer it would take, but as you can see, there are some files inside of this folder. So, let's look at them. Save this. Boom. I think this should just be images of me.

### 🎯 セクション 55

There we go. That's me. And that should be another image of me. Nice. So it successfully cracked the password of this zip zip protected folder which you couldn't do manually.

### 💭 セクション 56

I mean it would take you years if you're a good programmer. You could write Python scripts. You know again you would have to know what to do. You wouldn't know the order of steps. But Agent Zero knew exactly how to crack this in the shortest amount of time possible.

### 📌 セクション 57

But again we're only scratching the surface here. So let me show you another use case related to hacking which is finding subdomains of websites. Right? So companies often have domain website but then they have like admin.eite.com or dev.e. website.com which almost always have weaker security.

### ✅ セクション 58

So if you want to hack some website, again this is not advice. I'm just speculating. Finding these subdomains can be very useful. So I'm going to send this find all subdomains of scanme.nmap.org which is built for this. So this is completely legal and tell me which ones are live.

### 📚 セクション 59

Show me the results in the table. And we're going to let agent zero do its thing. So it calls a subordinate agent, gives a profile hacker, creates the prompt for that agent. You're a cyber security specialist performing authorized reconnaissance on scan.nmap.org. Then the first agent, as you can see, A1.

### 🔖 セクション 60

So this is where the name comes from, right? Agent zero is the first one which delegates to A1, which stands for agent one. It does its thing and this is a specialized agent for cyber security. And this agent is trying a bunch of different things. Starting subway enumeration, checking available tools, installing Subfinder.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, it's install some libraries or packages. Running subfinder, trying alternative enumeration methods, DNS brute force, and MS. Again, have no clue what these are. I'm not a cyber security professional, but Agent Zero can do this no problem. So, there we go.

### 🚀 セクション 62

It found four different subdomains. Uh, it took a couple of minutes, but yeah, again, I would have no idea how to do this, and agent zero did it in a single prompt. So, I think you're starting to see the true power of this AI agent. Now, the third use case I'm going to show you is how to use AgentZero as your personal accountant. Now, really, you can delegate to it all of your accounting, invoice processing, adding up expenses, whatever you need to do, and Agent Zero will do it.

### ⚡ セクション 63

So, let me show you. I have these three invoices right here. I'm going to just upload them to Agent Zero, and I'm going to tell it, calculate the total USD value of these invoices. Let's send that. And by the way, this could easily be 30 or even 300 different invoices.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Agent Zero is excellent at processing large files and also large number of files. So, it uses the document query tool with some queries right here. Boom. Code execution tool. Installs the necessary library to parse these PDFs.

### 🎬 セクション 65

And here's the response. I've analyzed all three invoices from Deonj. Boom. Google, Apple, Japka. So, as you can see, these companies have paid me 400K.

### 📋 セクション 66

Obviously, these are fake numbers. Again, try it with your own accounting. You'll be shocked. And again, all of the data is local. So, it's not being sent anywhere.

### ⭐ セクション 67

It's not being given to some third party companies especially if you run a local model like through Olama or LM Studio. Everything stays on your machine. This cannot be set for cloud code. This cannot be set for CIGBT. Agent zero is privacy first and it's security first and it's always going to remain that way.

### 📝 セクション 68

Now let's give it a lot harder task. Again, this is my statement from December. 24 pages of pure like hundreds of transactions, right? So, I'm going to say output a visual graph that categorizes my expenses from December as if you were a professional accountant. Now, again, some of this might need to be blurred because this is my actual bank account statement, but I just want to see how good Agent Zero really is at accounting.

### 💡 セクション 69

And by the way, you can expand any of the agent zero bubbles and you can see the thoughts, the inner workings of how it works. You can see I've received the data. This is a 24page document of transactions. Again, some of this might need to be blurred, but uh yeah, I just want to show you the real power of Agent Zero and uh that you can delegate to it many of the tasks that you're still doing manually or people on your team are doing manually. Agent Zero is much more powerful than people realize.

### 🔧 セクション 70

So, it's only a matter of time before millions of people are using it. So, if you're watching this, consider yourself one of the OG people because Agent Zero is still very underground. Even though it already has 30,000 stars on GitHub, most people still don't realize just how many fix it can do and how many use cases there actually are. So, boom. Now, it's going through every single transaction.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Again, I'm going to have to blur this, but watching Agent Zero work is very, very impressive. And again, keep in mind, I sent a single prompt. So, you could go to a cafe, you could go to the gym, you could do some push-ups, whatever you want to do while Agent Zero works by itself. And if you want to, you can obviously launch multiple agent zeros in parallel working on different tasks. So boom, here is the first graph that it generated.

### 💭 セクション 72

Again, we're going to have to blur some of these amounts. Probably just black them out. But look at this beautiful pie chart breaking down my expense distribution for the month of December. And here's the second report that I generated. Again, it's going to be probably heavily blurred and heavily censored, but man, this is impressive.

### 📌 セクション 73

Different categories, all the operational expenses beautifully colorcoded into different expense categories. And again, this would take me manually hours like five to 10 hours to do and a professional accountant would probably charge you hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Agent Zero did it for couple bucks. I mean listen, you can literally use super cheap models that can do it for couple pennies and it did it in what two three minutes guys we really are living in the future. The fourth use case I want to show you is how good agent zero is at visual stuff.

### ✅ セクション 74

So graphs, charts or manipulation of images and photos. So I'm going to send this prompt. Find the stock price of Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, and the price of Bitcoin from the first workday of each month in 2025. Then create a chart showing comparison of their market cap on those days in a single line chart. Again, doing this manually would be hours.

### 📚 セクション 75

I mean, so so much time, right? And even if you hired somebody even abroad from like Philippines or whatever, still that person would take, you know, day, two days, three days to do it. And you would have to pay that person way more than the price of these few tokens. In fact, while it's running, we can go to open router. And keep in mind guys, we're using one of the most expensive models.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Cloud Opus 4.5 is literally not a cheap model. This is one of the most expensive models out there. You could be using like Gemini free flash, which is like super cheap and still very powerful. But let's see how many we spent on this API key. So far, all of these use cases were just $4.7.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Okay, work that either would take me 20 plus hours or that if I wanted somebody else to do it would be thousands of dollars. Using the most expensive model, it's $4.7, guys. Insane. if you actually sit down and set these agents up, the leverage is amazing. Now, most people are just going to watch.

### 🚀 セクション 78

They're not going to put in the few minutes to install Agent Zero and to use it. But if you are going to do that, man, you're going to have such an advantage over everybody else. It's not even funny. In 2026, it's really going to be people who are using the cutting edge AI agents versus people who are just watching and observing. A lot of people think that if they're using CHBT, they're using AI, but you're not even scratching the surface.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Tools like AI agents exist, and most people are completely oblivious. And there we go. The answer is here. Look at this. We have the detailed prices on the first work month of every month.

### 🌟 セクション 80

And do we have also the file? There we go. Chart saved. So, let's click on this. Let's save it here.

### 🎬 セクション 81

There we go. Let's look at the visualization. And there we go. Market cap comparison Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, and Bitcoin in 2025 based on real web data created in like one and a half minutes. Yeah, incredible.

### 📋 セクション 82

Now, as I said, H&Z is very good at working with images, visual stuff. So, I'm going to give it this photo of Moz. This is just sparkling water. And I'm going to say remove the background, add shadow, and resize to 1,00x 10,000. So, this photo is like definitely not 1,000 by 10,000.

### ⭐ セクション 83

This is like a vertical photo. So, let's see if Agent Zero can do this. All right, there it is. Look at Look at that. It's crazy, guys.

### 📝 セクション 84

This is insane. So, the background was removed. The wooden floor is gone. There's a drop shadow you can see around it. And it's resized to 1,000 x 10,000, guys.

### 💡 セクション 85

Literally, you would have to do this in Photoshop or some, you know, Canva, whatever, some image editing tool. You would have to first have these subscribed. Like Adobe subscription is not cheap, right? And then you need to have the skill set to remove it. Even if that, even if you have the subscription, even if you have the skill set, it would take you a couple minutes to do.

### 🔧 セクション 86

What did I do? I simply dragged the file into agent zero and did like six, seven words and boom, it ran for like minute, two minutes. And here we go. We have the file exactly as I wanted. Crazy.

### 🎯 セクション 87

I don't know what to say. Now, the fifth use case how you can use Agent Zero is as your private AI consultant, right? CHGPT is not private. They collect all your data. They use it to train different models and they sell it to advertisers because ChBT now has ads.

### 💭 セクション 88

Same with Plexity. Same with all these cloud-based solutions. Agent Zero is local. It runs locally on your computer. So, the data stays here.

### 📌 セクション 89

So, for example, I have these files which are from Tesla. But let's say this is your company files, right? Or this is like your personal, you know, transcript from a therapy session or some, you know, data about your health, maybe blood test results, whatever you want to keep private, right? There's a lot of things you don't want to share on the internet. You don't want others to know, you don't want the government to know, whatever.

### ✅ セクション 90

So, let's say this is like your business data, right? You run a business. This is internal documents that you want to chat with and you still want to use an AI model to analyze them and to go back and forth but you don't want to give this data to open AI or enforopic because who would trust these companies right this is like the dumbest idea you can do so in Asian zero everything is on your computer so you can actually do this based on these two files help me understand how we can scale the business further and again these are SEC filings from Tesla so obviously it's not my business it's Elon business. But you get the point. These could be your CSV files.

### 📚 セクション 91

This could be Excel files, docu uh Microsoft Word files, whatever files you have, Agent Zero can process them, and it can help you chat with them without anything leaving your machine. And again, if you want to take this to the extreme, go to settings, go to agent settings, switch the provider to Olama. Boom. Ola right here. And you can run agent zero with Olama.

### 🔖 セクション 92

So if you have some models already downloaded, let's say like the Nemo short free nano, which again is like a 30 billion model and it's very powerful model, you can run this if you have a decent computer, right? You just need like 25 30 uh GB of VRAM. And this model is probably better than the original GPD4 was, but you can easily run it locally on your machine. And by the way, we're going to make a full tutorial on how to use Agent Zero with Olama, so that you can run local models as well on the AgentZero channel, which is going to be linked below as well. And there we go.

### 🎨 セクション 93

So, agent zero analyzed the detailed SEC filings and gave me a very strong answer based on it. And again, doing this manually would be ours. The sixth use case I'm going to show you is video editing. So, Agent Zero can do a lot of basic video editing operations. Let me just show you.

### 🚀 セクション 94

I'm going to paste in this 4K footage, which is uh almost 2 GB. I'm going to say rerender this as a 1080p file. Boom. Again, maybe you don't have Adobe Premiere installed or, you know, Da Vinci or whatever. Maybe you don't know anything about video editing.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Or maybe you just don't have time. Maybe you're working on some bigger project in Adobe and just want to quickly rerender this. So you throw it into agent zero. You tell it a single prompt, go to the toilet and few minutes later, you'll have the 1080p rerendered file. So now Asian zero is running ffmpeg to rerender this.

### 🌟 セクション 96

And again everything is local. Everything is within the docker container. All right, here we go. So it took like 2 minutes because you know rendering takes time. But here we have the 1080p version of the file.

### 🎬 セクション 97

And we can even see I didn't even ask for this comparison table, but it's very useful. So original is 4K with 45 bit rate. It's uh nearly 2 GB. This is compressed to just 200 megabytes and it's 1080p. So we can download this.

### 📋 セクション 98

Boom. Boom. Open this up. And yeah, it's still good quality. Very nice.

It's just 1080p. And we can even double check it just to make sure that Agent Zero isn't lying. So, this is a 1080p version. Let's do uh get info. There we go.

### 📝 セクション 100

Dimensions 1920 1080p. And if you look at the original, let's do get info. You can see this is 4K footage. Amazing. Now, let's take it a step further.

### 💡 セクション 101

We're going to give it another video editing task. I'm going to say take this 1080p file and rerender it as a 1,00% time-lapse with no audio. So maybe you have some, you know, skiing footage or some flight footage or driving footage and just want to time-lapse. And again, you can absolutely do this in Adobe Premiere, but it would take you a few minutes and you have to do it manually. Guys, it's 2026.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Why are you still doing these tasks manually? Things like Agent Zero exist. Now, most of you probably don't know about Agent Zero until now. And most of you that do know about it probably won't take the few minutes to set it up. But those few percent of you who are the exceptional individuals will get such a crazy advantage if you actually start using agent zero for these small tasks.

### 🎯 セクション 103

Save 2 minutes there, 5 minutes there, 30 minutes there. It adds up. It compounds. If you use agent zero for all 2026, man, you're going to get work done of like three people. Now, maybe some of you are entrepreneurs, maybe you have three people on your team.

### 💭 セクション 104

Think about the power if you distribute agent zero to all of them and if you instruct them to use agent zero. This really compounds every single unit of your time and it allows you to do tasks that normally you would need expensive software for or skill sets that take months or years to master. With Agent Zero, it's like a single prompt. Couple minutes and it's done. So, boom.

### 📌 セクション 105

Here's the time-lapse. Time-lapse is ready. 10x speed. Let's download it and let's watch it. Yeah, you can clearly see this is a time-lapse, man.

### ✅ セクション 106

A amazing. Now the next insane use case for agent zero is coding. A lot of AI agents can do coding but usually they cannot actually run the code. So look at my prompt. Write a Fibonacci function three ways loop recursion and memorization.

### 📚 セクション 107

Run each one 100,000 times and tell me which is fastest with exact timing. Right? So not only can it write the code for this, it can also run the code time it and give you the results of this benchmark. So let's say you have a you know some sorting mechanism in your app or you have like two different implementations of your back end and you want to see which is fastest without deploying it to production you just send it to agent zero and it will run it it will write the code run the code and then tell you the results. So we can see the memorized is the fastest 1x this is 75 times slower and pure recursion is 14,000 times slower and this took like what 25 seconds.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Incredible. Another use case related to coding is going to be compiling code into an executable. So let's say you have some code you paste it in there could be the raw text or obviously file attachment and then you say take this Python script install PI installer and build it into standalone executable. To be honest, you don't even need to drop the name PI installer. It would know what to do.

### 🎨 セクション 109

But basically, just say, give me an standalone executable, then run the executable and show me the output, right? So, you give it some code and you let it cook. You let it turn it into an actual app, an executable that you can execute, you know, you can run it. It's not just a Python script that you would need. Python installing machine, you would need to use it in the terminal.

### 🚀 セクション 110

No, it'll just give you a executable package and it can even run it itself and check the results which again cloth code cannot do and even if it could do it, it would ask you for permissions every step of the way and it would run into errors, all that stuff. It would just be a lot of user input if you wanted to use clo or something else. With agent zero, you don't need to do that because it has its own operating system. So, it can just do anything it needs to do. There we go.

### ⚡ セクション 111

It ran the command. It gives us the script. We have the executable right here. We have the build spec everything we need and it even ran the executable and gave us the result of the script. So current temperature in proc minus 10 pretty crazy I cannot wait to go back to Dubai.

### 🌟 セクション 112

The next coding related use case is going to be debugging. So again I'm going to give it some code boom this is a Python script simple Python script but this could be as complex as you want. And then I'm going to say profile this script with C profile. Show me the three slowest functions and explain why they're slow. So it's not just looking at the code.

### 🎬 セクション 113

It's real debugging. It's going to do a speed profile of these different functions and then analyze what could be making these functions slow. Boom. There it is. Z profile analysis results.

### 📋 セクション 114

Total execution time 0.6 seconds for 10 iterations of main. Pretty slow functions. So slow function. Boom. Why each function is slow?

### ⭐ セクション 115

So obviously there's a fake sleep timer because it's a simple script. But feel free to test it with your code and you'll be surprised what agent zero can find. Now let's take it one step further and let's see if agent zero can execute a full analysis of a GitHub repo. How secure it is and whether there are any critical vulnerabilities. So a lot of you are vibe coders, right?

### 📝 セクション 116

You're not professional developers. So you're going to have security vulnerabilities. You're going to have issues with your code, bugs, gaps, improper authentication, all that stuff, right? So you can just give it your GitHub repo or just upload all the files individually and have Agent Zero test your project. See if it can find any gaps before it goes into production and before you run into any serious issues.

### 💡 セクション 117

Now again this is taking a few minutes because it's loading a whole repo and uh setting up the NexJS environment or node server for this. But you get the point. Agent zero can do a lot when it comes to coding but in a different way than cloud core cursor because it can run its own server. It can execute the code. It can analyze it.

### 🔧 セクション 118

It can install libraries to pentest the code. All these things plot code or cursor either cannot do or you would need to give them the tools. You need to build the tools or you need to connect MCP servers that already exist. But you need to know these servers exist, right? So there's a lot of knowledge or a lot of skill required to properly use these other tools.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Not with agent zero. With agent zero, you type in plain English and it will figure out what to do by itself. It will test it. If it runs into error or try something else, it doesn't ask you every two seconds for confirmation. because it has its own operating system inside of the Docker container.

### 💭 セクション 120

Now, the eighth use case I'm going to show you for Agent Zero is using it as your own personal task manager where all of the data stays on your machine. So, as the world governments are becoming more and more authoritarian, as companies collect more and more data, it'll become more and more essential to keep as much as your data private local in your machine, not uploaded in the cloud, not reliant or Google or you know big tech including task manager. So let's say you don't want to use notion or to-doist or whatever. You want to keep everything locally in your machine. You can do that with agent zero.

### 📌 セクション 121

So I told it you are my personal task manager. Store everything in tasks MD. Track task name, due date and priority. When I add tasks, save them. When I ask what to focus on, tell me what's overdue or due soon.

### ✅ セクション 122

Sorted by priority. So again, this is not just a private list, a private database of tasks. Since we have a full AI agent here, it can think, it can reason and tell you what to focus on. So for example, you can tell it add a task finish YouTube script high priority due tomorrow. And it will hopefully update the local file which is stored in the Docker container by inserting the task into the task list.

### 📚 セクション 123

There we go. Here's what our task list looks like right now. Let's add another task. Review vectoral PRs medium priority due Friday. So boom.

### 🔖 セクション 124

Now we should have two tasks in our task list. There we go. Let's add a third one. So the third task is book dentist appointment low priority due next week. There we go.

### 🎨 セクション 125

Everything is stored inside of this tasks MD file. And now here comes the magic, right? You can say what should I focus on today. Obviously with three tasks it's easy. But let's say you have 20, 50 or 100.

### 🚀 セクション 126

Personally I have hundreds of tasks in my task managers. I literally spent the last 14 months just solving this problem myself with vector, right? Because my mind is a storm. It constantly generates new tasks. I get between 10 and 40 new ideas per day that I have to write down.

### ⚡ セクション 127

And task pization is, you know, a huge huge problem for people who run businesses and who do a lot of things. So agent zero lets you manage your tasks completely locally. Everything is private. Everything is secure. Nothing leaves your machine.

### 🌟 セクション 128

It's stored in a markdown file or you can do different formats like CSV file, whatever. Doesn't really matter. The main thing is that it's privacy first, right? Your tasks and your data isn't leaving your machine. It's in here and you can still use powerful AI models to interact with it and to help you sort it out.

### 🎬 セクション 129

So let's say today's focus finish YouTube script. This is your number one priority. We have less than 24 hours to complete it. Amazing. So I have intelligence in my task list and the data is private.

### 📋 セクション 130

So yeah, this really is the future. local software that is custom private on your machine and Agent Zero is a huge step towards that. Now, if you want to learn more about Agent Zero, go to the Agent Zero GitHub, give it a star, and play around with it yourself. At the beginning, I showed you how to set it up. So, go back and watch this video again.

### ⭐ セクション 131

As I said, there's a huge difference between people who are simply watchers and people who are doers. If you watch and you don't execute anything, you don't implement, you're going to get no value. You'll get still some dopamine. You feel like you've learned something. you feel like you're on the cutting edge of AI, but if you actually are serious about AI, go and watch this video again and implement every single step.

### 📝 セクション 132

Try these use cases on your own files. Try all of them and see what works. Try stuff that I haven't tried and comment below what works. Agent Zero is super powerful. It can literally do anything.

### 💡 セクション 133

So, people are still discovering what it can do. And if you're a developer and if you want to build on top of Agent Zero, again, go to the GitHub. I'm going to link it below and give it a star and fork it yourself. It's fully open source so you can go through all the files and see how it works. Yeah, this is the difference between agent zero and cloud code and cursor.

### 🔧 セクション 134

These tools are not open source. So you have no idea what's happening inside of them, which data is being collected for agent zero. You know, nothing is being collected. Everything is on GitHub. You can go through it and look at it.

### 🎯 セクション 135

That being said, these are eight insane use cases on Agent Zero. So yeah, if you like this video, make sure to subscribe and also subscribe to Agent Zero's channel. With that being said, thank you guys for watching and I wish you a wonderful productive week. See you.
