## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

OpenAI introduces Chad PT health, a dedicated experience in Chad PT designed for health and wellness. There is a weight list. I encourage everybody to join. When you click join the weight list, it says 44 not found. It gives you a nice little poem.

### 📋 背景・概要

In the heat of day, the path dissolves to nothing. M dash an empty mirage. A beautiful poem. A little bit annoying, but it's very likely that they're getting tons of people that are trying to get in right now. So certainly understandable.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, there's a couple things to understand here. First and foremost, there has been some leaked information from OpenAI. I believe the original source was the information.com and it informed us that the product that OpenAI is working on, the thing that we've all kind of been waiting for is actually a pen. Something that looks like this. This is it.

### 📝 詳細説明

This is just a random pen that I had, but I assume it's probably going to have a similar form factor. You clip it on to your pocket. Sounds like it might have camera and audio, so being able to record, and it's going to have Chad GBT built in. It sounds like OpenAI is currently working on a very specific model that's going to be used for this new product, this pen. So, I'm sure at this point, everybody's used advanced voice mode.

### 💡 実例・デモ

It's pretty good, but there's some issues that they're trying to iron out. So, like when you interrupt it, how well you're able to interrupt it in order to start a new chain of conversation. And it's meant to be the third device. So, kind of how you have your phone. Everybody has a phone.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

A lot of people have maybe some sort of a watch. I have my Whoop here or an Aura Ring or whatever. Smartwatch, Apple Watch, whatever. This is meant to be the third thing that you carry around with you everywhere you go. So, this to me really seems to go along with this idea.

### 🎯 応用例

Just something to keep in mind as we read this. Another quick angle to keep in mind. So, this is Jimmy Apples. We've mentioned him before. We're not sure who he is, but at this point, most people that follow AI news, we kind of know that he's got some insider information specifically about OpenAI, but also kind of the Bay Area AI frontier labs and startups in general.

### 💭 考察

He basically knows some things before the rest of us find out about it. So, sometimes he'll tweet something very cryptically and months later we're like, "Oh, this is the thing that he's been talking about." Now, recently, Jimmy Apples also posted this, saying, "The corp slop has won. Long live the old OpenAI. Its spirit now dead." Now, that likely refers to an engineer who recently left OpenAI, but we'll also kind of see if maybe this plays into this new announcement. But, let's dive into this Chad GPT health and see what this whole thing is about.

### 📌 まとめ

So, the idea is pretty simple. ChadBt Health can help you navigate everyday questions and spot patterns over time so you feel more informed, prepared and confident for important medical conversations. We recently interviewed Farzad from YouTube and of course his handle is Farziness on X. One of the things that we talked about on our podcast and our interview is this post, which by the way, Elon Musk jumped in there asking a few clarifications, but here Farzad is saying that his favorite use case for Claude code, and he credits somebody else that kind of posted this idea on X, but he fed the entire raw genetic file from 23 and me, plus this latest comprehensive blood work, plus the latest scans from the arteries checking for plaque, plus my entire supplement. routine.

### ✅ 結論

So, I got to say this is impressive. I've done my blood work and I fed it to Chad GBT way back in the days when it just was announcing the deep research capability or they were calling it the pro version and I've posted those results on Exxon on YouTube and I was extremely impressed because I could upload my actual medical information from my blood work and it would go line by line, explain everything, but specifically it would also be able to answer questions kind of customized to me. So, if I said, you know, here's my age, here's some of the supplements that I take, here's some of the maybe the issues that I'm having, like how can we translate that to actionable advice that I can take to feel better, to be healthier, etc. And it was incredible. It was very informative.

### 📚 追加情報

It was very actionable. It was educational. I learned more about what those numbers mean in a way that you can't really get from a visit to the doctor's office or surfing the internet. And so I do feel like a lot of people are sleeping on this. This is kind of a big big deal.

### 🔖 補足

But Fzad took it to the next level, feeding it basically everything. I mean, if you think about it, just feeding it your entire genetic file, right? So if you get your genome sequenced, it's this massive amounts of information that's extremely hard to kind of decode unless you really know what you're doing. But based on this, he was able to come up with a tailored plan specifically based on his genes and his current health. and he's saying this is going to transform healthcare.

### 🎨 セクション 13

By the way, I agree 100%. Elon Musk jumped in saying anything actionable apart from eat healthy and work out, which is a great question because I do find that often times these models do kind of get lazy and they kind of default to the basics. They're like, "Eat a lean meat. Follow the Mediterranean diets. Make sure you get your movement in your 10,000 steps.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Sleep well." And like, we all know this, but I don't know if I would consider that useful or actionable advice just because we all kind of know this, right? So, I know it's important advice, but it's not just because somebody else repeats it for the millionth time is not as helpful. So, Fzadat answers yes. For example, I was on a B12 supplement, but my genetics showed that I wasn't able to break it down nearly as well as a different kind of B12. Same with omega3s.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, in our interview, I kind of followed up because I'm like, this sounds like the MTHFR mutation. The MTHFR gene mutation is an annoying mutation because it has some downsides. I most likely have it. I've never actually did my full uh genetic makeup, but based on my testing, I'm like 90% sure that I have it. By the way, you might have heard this referred to by a different name.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, if you notice how it's spelled, MTHFR, and people don't like having this mutation. There's another name that people refer to it as. The first part is mother, right? So, mother FR, you can figure it out. Recently, Kevin Rose and Tim Ferrris on their podcast were talking about how Kevin Rose used with a Chad GBT or some other chatbot to actually do research into because he also has this gene mutation, the MTHFR mutation.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And he talked about how he over time figured out how he was able to lower his homocyine levels. In his case, he used the NAC knack supplement among other things. But the point is, this is one of those things where most people are not going to have any issues eating certain foods. And for people with this mutation, it can really gunk up the machinery and cause all sorts of problems. And a lot of is basically having to do with methylation, how your body methylates or you can think of it as sort of producing certain needed components from raw materials, right?

### 📋 セクション 18

Right? So if you think of your body as like we input raw materials here and it has to sort of break them down into all the needed different parts in order to make sure that your cardiovascular neurological reproductive health that that all of that is working properly if certain things get clogged and the whole thing stops working. If you've ever played Factorio you know what that's like. So in this case this G mutation has a trouble converting folate to its active form. Fivemethyl tetrahydroofolate 5 mthf.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So for example for me I always have this methylated folate a supplement that I get. I always have it. I I might run out of some some other supplements but this one I always have on hand. The 5 mthf. Now, I figured this out before chatbots existed through hours and hours and hours of research and listening to podcasts with various doctors, reading various books.

### 📝 セクション 20

So, hundreds of hours, I'm pretty sure I can safely say, to figure out these little things that make me feel better, that make my life better, that make me healthier. hundreds of hours of work to figure this out. And probably 2025 was the first year where chatbots got good enough to actually be able to do this. But now you can upload your raw genetic data to something like this and you know add your supplements, blood work, etc. And it just tells you like hey you've got this mutation.

### 💡 セクション 21

Here's what that means and here's some brain dead simple solutions for how to implement it and to make your life better. Right? So, we went from hundreds of hours of research and and by the way, most people won't do that research. I'm just insane. I kind of enjoy doing it, but for most people, they don't have the time nor the interest to dig that deep into their specific genome or their specific biology to figure out these tiny little tweaks to make them feel better, perform better, etc.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, this is going to transform healthcare. This is 100% true. There's this saying is like if you want to know what the future looks like, the the technological future, really what predicts it with a shockingly high degree of accuracy is you just take a look at what are all the tech nerds doing in their free time, you know, on on Saturday and Sunday. What are they focused on? You could have predicted this kind of AI wave based on what people were doing in 2023 2024.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Although it already blew up by 2024, but like like 22 23 if you just looked at what all the nerds were talking about, you can kind of predict this thing blowing up. By the way, just yesterday I ran this in Chad 5.2 Pro. So I had a question. It went out, did 14 minutes worth of research and kind of typed it up for me here. Specifically, I was very interested to understand the how dopamine works because I find that tons of people say things about dopamine, but they don't fully understand the process or it's a certain shortorthhand because there's basically the kind of the natural production of dopamine.

### 💭 セクション 24

Then there's the release of dopamine caused by certain activities or mean stimulants to that as well. And then there's the dopamine actually attaching to the to the receptors which is that reward signal. But my point here is that these chat bots, especially with the advanced pro mode, etc. can do deep research into the things that specifically you're talking about because a lot of stuff they're kind of broad and it might not apply to you. So getting customtailored information that applies to you specifically isn't very easy.

### 📌 セクション 25

So my big point here with ChadBt Health is that this or something like this, it doesn't have to be OpenAI, it doesn't have to be Chad GBT, but someone's going to build this killer app that helps you track all of your health metrics, that knows your genome, that knows your blood work, the supplementation that you're taking. Ideally, it even tracks your daily food intake passively. I recently tested out this app called Bite Pal. This is not sponsored. They're not paying me to say this.

### ✅ セクション 26

In fact, I end up signing up for their paid program, so I'm paying them. But this is one of the first ones that I've seen where you're able to just snap a picture of your food and they use some sort of an AI model to estimate the macros, the calories, etc. Now, in the past, I've tried it with advanced models from OpenAI and Gemini, etc. to see how well they do. There's a few Chad Gabbt models that were incredibly good at visually just breaking down, you know, the calories, the macros accurately, but I always kind of assume that we're never going to see those highquality models being used in everyday apps like this because you can't have a free app and also use an an advanced expensive image recognition AI model to do this and and you need a really good one.

### 📚 セクション 27

And maybe in the future we'll get to the point where it'll be cheap enough to where we're able to have a free app that does that. But right now, this is a paid app, so you you do have to pay some yearly fee in order to use it. But its ability to, you know, track all your macros by just snapping a photo. This has been so far really good. If they don't downgrade it to save on costs, I'm probably going to continue to use this.

### 🔖 セクション 28

But you can imagine some sort of glasses or even that pen if it's able to, you know, track if you're able to just pull it out and kind of point it at your food. Kind of like a Harry Potter wand. You kind of go like this and it sort of takes a picture of your food and then tracks it. You can imagine a all-in-one app that does all that. All of your health, all of your diet, tracks your exercise.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Might even replace something like the Whoop or the Aura where it tracks your sleep and everything. Everything. Everything. You go into the doctor, you hit a little button on it, it records the conversation with your doctor. It adds those notes to your file.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Right now, one thing that I'm struggling with is, you know, over the years I've done tons of blood work, but it's all in different places in various accounts. I've never bothered to just add it to one place that I control. It's always at some doctor website or whatever. Having something like this could easily store and organize and automate all of your information one place. Now, I'm not saying again, keep in mind, I'm not saying Chad GPT help this particular thing is going to be that.

### ⚡ セクション 31

What I'm saying is there will be by one of these companies there will be something like this that is just absolutely indispensable to people that completely revolutionizes your health that enables people to do biohacking or experiments or just keep track of their health to make intelligent decisions and put everything into one place. So here they're saying that this app health will be able to incorporate medical records and apps like Apple Health, My Fitness Pal, and Pelaton. By the way, if you were curious on what I found out during my research into dopamine, really it comes down to two things. One is do zone 2 cardio. Zone 2 cardio is kind of like you can think of it as a brisk walk.

### 🌟 セクション 32

It's something you can do where you can still keep up a conversation, but it's kind of difficult. So, it's at the upper limit of being able to keep up a conversation. So, for some people that might be jogging, for some people that might be walking. So, that's number one thing. something that apparently helps you develop more dopamine receptors, allows for BDNF, which then translates to neuroplasticity.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, that's kind of huge. And the second thing is just be okay with being bored more often. Someone asked me the other day, they said, "Have you ever raw dogged a flight?" I was very confused. I'm like, "Excuse me, raw dog a flight? What does that mean?" And they said, "Well, have you ever like took a plane somewhere and you didn't use your phone or headphones or a book?

### 📋 セクション 34

You just sat there and, you know, stared straight ahead." And I thought about it. I said, "No, not anytime recently. Usually use some form of media to entertain yourself, right? You get your phone out, you listen to an audiobook. Maybe there's some magazines that you can look at that are there." But I thought it was kind of interesting that this sort of word is being kind of re-emerging to just mean be bored, be okay without technology, be okay without entertainment, right?

### ⭐ セクション 35

Can you rogue your walk, your drive? Can you just sit in a chair, not need some sort of entertainment constantly in your face? I got to say, I've lost that ability over the last 10 years or so. Or at least I I I don't even attempt it. I usually have to have some sort of interaction with a screen when nothing else is going on.

### 📝 セクション 36

But it sounds like not doing that, being a little bit more bored, not trying to be entertained all the time is very helpful for the dopamine systems in our brains. So here open continues and I think this gives us a glimpse into kind of what they're aiming for, right? are saying Chad PT Health can explain test results, help you prepare for doctor's visits, advise on a diet and workouts, and compare insurance plans. Now, of course, the compare insurance plans is the thing that likely can pay for this entire thing. They'll probably have medical insurance or life insurance or whatever other medical products or services they can provide that could be monetized extremely extremely well.

### 💡 セクション 37

And that's probably one of the things that they're looking for in terms of how do, you know, they're losing money right now. How do they increase their revenue? How do they make this eventually profitable? They do also note that all of this medical information that they're going to be using, it's not going to like pop into your regular chats, right? So, it's going to be stored in a specific sort of section.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So, if you ask the chatbot something, it's not going to randomly mention some medical condition you have. I've asked JGBT to roast me a few times in the past and uh it's it's sometimes kind of hurtful because it does utilize its its knowledge of you, the stuff that you've asked in the past and it just like kind of just throws it in your face. Andre Karpathy posted one of his experiments in asking Chai GPT to roast him which I thought was hilarious. It said something along the lines of, you know, you're like a worldclass expert in machine learning, but the other day you asked me how to boil an egg, right? Which I thought was hilarious cuz yeah, he probably just Yeah, like how long do I boil an egg for?

### 🎯 セクション 39

He asked that of Chad GPT and later just gets thrown in his face. You don't want that happening with your private medical information. Can you imagine? So, I just realized that probably the reason that I get a 404 is because Apple Health requires iOS. is going to be rolling out to everyone on the web and iOS soon.

### 💭 セクション 40

And of course, if you're on Android, you are a secondass citizen and no one loves you. So, if you have a Pixel phone as your main device like I do, that means you're a bad person. So, hopefully this thing will have a good bedside matter. So, I got to say, I'm pretty excited about this. Not necessarily this app, although it could be this app that becomes the killer app for this particular application.

### 📌 セクション 41

But in general, this or something like this will eventually become an indispensable part of our life or of our ability to track our health, to improve our health, to do various experiments. I know most people won't like the idea of doing experiments, but for me, I'd love the idea to be able to track lifestyle changes to see how well they affect me. If I switch my diet or exercise routine, how can I track everything in one place and get actionable advice where some chatbot, I can just ask it, okay, go back. I've did this for the last 3 months. What changes do you see?

### ✅ セクション 42

and have it go and read and do all the digging and then just give me the actual information I'm looking for. So, let me know what you think about it. Is it exciting? Are there some concerns that you have? Certainly, there could be a lot of nefarious things with this if it's not handled properly.

### 📚 セクション 43

But whatever the case, let me know what you think. My name is Wes Roth and I'll see you in the next
