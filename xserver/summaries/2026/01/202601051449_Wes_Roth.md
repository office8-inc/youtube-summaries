## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

The problems I see with AI, fake people, fake data, political manipulation. And so what all the doomers are doing, they're literally making stuff up because there is no mechanism by which an AGI can become super intelligent, get control of the systems, have agency, and do [music] anything. It is nonsense. We think that AIs have anywhere near the creativity or potentiality of living systems. They are nothing.

### 📋 背景・概要

They are nothing compared to living systems. Complex multisellular creatures have agency and AI has none. Hi there, I'm Lee Cronin. I'm the regest professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow and also the CEO of a company called Chemifi and I want to find out how life started. All right, let's just start with one of the questions that I feel like everybody thinks about when they're younger, which is why why something not nothing?

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

I would ask the other way round. Why nothing and not something? And so I think the the problem is that um the fact that well that's it's actually the simplest question to answer I think is existence is the only thing that happens when causation is possible. And so the the the ridiculous thing is the fact that matter exists in the way it does means that um it's been able to fight against randomness in the background. And that's kind of obvious but actually deeply profound.

### 📝 詳細説明

The mechanism by which matter of any structure exists in the universe is because it's had to survive against degragation. And so why something happen stance selection causation and evolution or it maybe should be causation via selection that gives you evolution because actually the universe at the base I just realized today is random and basically featureless and so that's kind of that blew my mind. My mind is still blown from that. And this last was about 5 hours ago I realized that >> like pure entropy. >> We have to talk about this.

### 💡 実例・デモ

You know what happened? >> Not necessarily pure entropy but pure um just there's stuff. It's just bubbling stuff but there is no you just get the basic laws of physics which are kind of pretty boring, right? but or inspiring to us that go oh look there's stars and galaxies and stuff but the laws of physics just give you you know fusion and elements and then chemistry has to kick in and chemistry is perhaps the most profound thing that happened to physics I would say that as a chemist but finally I found my position of the universe so the reason why there's something and not nothing is because of chemistry >> absolutely and so chemistry being kind of almost a computational force Um, and that's why we see certain systems emerge, certain complexity emerge. Um, so I'm I'm still very curious.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

You said something happened five hours ago that changed your view. I can we just I can't get my mind off of that. >> So I was So it wasn't it wasn't just my changed my view, but solidified. I had to explain to a couple of physicists I'm working with just starting a new project with that basically is going to explain a new in basically we have this problem in physics and I'm not a physicist right I'm a chemist so like anyone listening to this can just discount anything I say from that but I'm right and what I mean by I'm right is I'm I'm able to use this idea to come up with a new prediction like a test that I would not be able to produce using any other theory but basically 5 hours ago as I was talking to visitors colleagues a phys a so one of them is more a philosopher and one of them is more a theoretical physicist but they kind of interchange and I was trying to explain how causation manifests and we realize that in physics you have Newtonian physics and you have quantum mechanics they suffer from the same problem and quantum mechanics is not mysterious in the way that fman said it's just because they couldn't get their heads around causation and I feel somewhat you know kind unqualified to say that cuz Fman was one of the greatest geniuses that ever lived. But he was wrong because he just accepted what he was taught about causation, the lack of causation.

### 🎯 応用例

And so when you put causation back at the beginning, you realize that the reason why the universe exists is something has to manifest from nothing via causation. And the way we interpret that right now in physics is that we have to put causation into phys. We can't put we accept we think that cause physics has no causation. And the way we jimmy rig it is literally by putting in quantum mechanics and and the macros scale Newtonian mechanics. Um it might sound quite bizarre but it's really obvious when you dig down because there is no quantum woo.

### 💭 考察

There is just causation. Interesting. Okay. Let's just break it down. So everybody kind of get everybody caught up and we're I think we're going to come back to this just so one of the things you said so causation to selection to evolution.

### 📌 まとめ

So evolution I think most people kind of understand it's growing complexity improvement. Um selection is kind of like let's say AB testing right for a lot of the people listening right you'd split test two pages this page does better so it kind of survives and goes on so there's a a selection pressure can we define causation in the most basic terms so that most people can kind of grasp what we mean exactly the kind of what you're talking about. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah.

### ✅ 結論

So I mean I would say actually AB testing doesn't is is is is is um higher level selection. Selection is something that emerges. But let's go back to causation. Causation gives rise to that. >> So if I take two rocks, if I take a small rock and a big rock and I put this and I hit the small rock at the big rock, the big rock doesn't move.

### 📚 追加情報

Right? So there be some causation. The rock just moves. Nothing happens. If I take the big rock and hit this small rock, the small rock will like move and it could then hit another rock and hit another rock.

### 🔖 補足

That's causation. So when A basically precedes B but by by by looking at the kind of phase space you can see that actually the energy from A goes into B which then causes B to move and going do something to C. That's what I mean at the bottom is causation. And a phys a very famous philosopher called Bertrren Russell um said you know causation is like the monarchy it's just symbolic doesn't do anything. and and cause Newton thought this and Einstein thought this and everyone thought this.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So all our physical theories have ignored the fact that causation is real. So A implies B. Now in physics there's no causation. Causation is immersion. But when you look at the emergence of biology and I suppose um consciousness um imagination, free will and intelligence, you need causation to make that happen.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And so so five hours ago I was talking with a couple of colleagues who were thinking about how we frame this precisely in physics because it's not every day you just tear up the you know the textbooks all of them and say well maybe it's all wrong and and not wrong in a oh we've been using the wrong paradigms because the mathematics of quantum mechanics works the mathematics of Newtonian mechanics works to some degree but what it doesn't do is explain intelligence and biology That's a very critical problem. So yeah, so it's kind of fresh. So forgive me for not being terribly eloquent, but basically causation um is the mechanism by which selection occurs. Selection then provides allows matter some matter to exist over other. The existence of that matter over time in the end produces biology and intelligence which kind of mind-blowing, right?

### ⚡ セクション 15

>> Absolutely. >> Yeah. And so just to make sure I get this right. So causation isn't on the most bottom level. That's something that does emerge or is that the change?

### 🌟 セクション 16

>> Um no. So what no causation is on the bottom level. But what happens is you've got this imagine you got this foam almost imagine you've got bubbles that are bursting, right? Like almost what do you want to call it? Quantum foam or just like I don't like that.

### 🎬 セクション 17

It's just like there's just random stuff happening. So into existence if you like like imagine sand grains. Some sand grains could aggregate and make a shape and that shape will be fleeting and then will decompose back into sand grains. So that's called so when the sand grains aggregate that's not causation that's just a random process. However, if some sand grains bind together and they are then able to then affect other sand grains to bind together and you almost have a snowball effect.

### 📋 セクション 18

That's kind of the emergence of causation from randomness. But I use emergence in a in the wrong. It's like it's not emergence. It's something quantitatively different. It is just the existence.

### ⭐ セクション 19

But the fact that something is able to exist in time beyond its natural halflife means that there is a chance memory that's been trapped in the in the universe that can reproduce that structure. And it's happening all the time. And the universe is making, let's call them memories, causal chains that basically can affect move sand grains around, but then they're just lost because it's just random. But if those grains get together and they can help other grains exist, suddenly you have something like cooperation or templating and you get this scaffolding. And really the you the reason why we have something rather than nothing is matter that has persisted against the attrition of the environment.

### 📝 セクション 20

And then when you think about that long enough, it's obvious that life is the only thing that physics can produce to teach physics that physics is not what we think it is. And so it's kind of inverted in that we think our universe is lawike, but it's not really. It's random with some kind of probabilistic laws. The only reason the universe is lawike is that biology produces error correction. And I So there's a lot I've just said in the last two minutes.

### 💡 セクション 21

I'm sorry. >> No, that's good. Well, let's stay in the very bottom level. So, this I guess quantum foam or whatever this sort of randomness is, is there no memory on that level? Like, is there anything like pilot wave theory or something that's kind of aware that one bubble burst over here after another bubble over there?

### 🔧 セクション 22

Or that's just not even part of the way to think about. >> I mean, the onlogical interpretations of quantum mechanics are very complicated in that or no, very diverse. So, at this way, I would be very parimonious. Say, let's ignore all quantum mechanics for now. Quantum mechanics is a lovely tool.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Mathematically, it works, right? But let's just think in terms of particles. I know everyone's having like a field. It's all fields. I'm like, sure.

### 💭 セクション 24

I mean, I can I mean, I'm a workshop here. I can I can pick up nails and screwdrivers. These aren't fields. These are localized material objects. So, when people start saying it's all fields, I'm like, sure, when I'm tripping.

### 📌 セクション 25

And so if you start at the bottom, what happens is these objects have to kind of somehow um they have to create a structure that somehow is able to persist in time more than the other ones. And how does that happen? Well, in physics, it can't happen because there is this search problem. Like so in physics is just the combinations are just too small. You just basically search all the space and they all collapse down.

### ✅ セクション 26

When you get to chemistry, you get a combinatorial explosion where the number of possibilities is too big to search. So when the number of possibilities too big to search, you get start weird frozen accidents. And what frozen accidents plus kind of the randomness of the universe is how causation is that's I guess if I you then use emergence that's then how emer causation emerges. But it emerges at the microphysical level and then goes all the way up to memes and AI and Tik Tok. >> Absolutely.

### 📚 セクション 27

So I guess I guess one way to kind of look at it that I think maybe might help people just kind of uh understand what what we're talking about here if I understand correctly is basically if you think about uh the universe if it's just a bunch of random stuff or whatever, right? There's no memory. There's no story line so to speak. And some people might be familiar Yeah. Like if you have uh multiple comic book panels and we kind of shuffle them, you might be able to put them together based because there's like this seems to be like a story line that unfolds.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Um and if life is and and these these chemical processes kind of like the universe developing a memory and then it becomes like a a story uh in words you can kind of tell it moves from state A to B to C, etc. Um, and uh, what you're saying is that's kind of what we're talking about when we're saying causality, right? That's kind of the idea that it's not just random. There's some sort of storyline or or there, right? >> Yeah.

### 🎨 セクション 29

The Exactly. Causation is the presence of a memory in the universe that allows another thing to happen. Right. It's like if you're like typing something up, you know what words you're going to say. You type them.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You've caused them. I think the causation is a very interesting phenomena that we don't yet understand. And I mean um it's kind of I mean what I'm saying is it's it's not wrong. I I don't think so. I'm really excited.

### ⚡ セクション 31

But I think what we need to do is this these ideas need to be tested experimentally. The nice thing about coming up with new theory, you know, I get lots of theories all the time and I say that people give me these theories like thanks to that theory like people using AI to generate theories. is kind of is kind of depressing and elating all at the same time that we could talk about is that um if the theory doesn't suggest something outrageous that nothing else suggests and then you can make a unique test. It's not really a new theory, right? It's just a kind of recategorization of what we know and colleagues who do this all the time.

### 🌟 セクション 32

There's a lot of famous kind of you know pseudo physicists who have big mathematics projects and you can guess who they are who keep doing this. They keep dreaming up new theories, but they're not new theories. They just predict what we already know. And it's the habal that we have to have is like if I want to come up with a new theory such as with causation, it has to quantitatively do something different, predict something different to what all the other theories did and then we go and do it and show it and and that's what we're doing right now. And that's kind of mind-blowing.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So that's good. So it's kind of like I almost get a free pass to kind of keep doing experiments until it breaks. >> So fun. So, thinking like uh kind of lower level and how things build up, has it given you maybe a more specific or a more useful definition for life? We've had some great conversations about like what life is, but they seem like each definition doesn't capture something everybody can use.

### 📋 セクション 34

Like, where are you on the definition? >> Yeah. So I I I marvel at this in that um I thought that it you're right that defining life is a bit like talking to let's first of all get a load of life definers in a room. I would call them artists and then ask them to draw a picture. They'll all draw a different picture and it's amazing and and I and I think that probably they're missing something because they're trying to say oh life does this does this does this.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And what I tried to do at the beginning, which actually gave rise to assembly theory, was say, hey, let's stop trying to define life, let's instead look at what life does uniquely that non-life doesn't do. And then, ironically, in a way or quite amazingly, it allowed me to come up with a definition of life that passes muster. And basically my definition of life is uh well actually this is paraphrased through the mythbusters guy and Adam is it Adam Savage when I was talking to him about it at a meeting and he was and I was saying oh wow life makes complex things he's like right good and you can you can calculate the complexity in some way but then you have to have lots of identical copies and he said oh so life does complex [ __ ] at scale >> so that's kind of like the kind of lay version but the more technical version which actually is not that different version anyone would understand it is saying living systems are able to create objects recursively that have lots of different parts that you can count above a threshold that non-life can't do and if you make more than one copy because one copy could be just a random the more copies you have and the the larger the number of uh parts or the larger the assembly index the more certain you are that only life could have produced it. And that for me when I came up with that with my team and my collaborators allowed me to do something which was really nice which was to unify viruses and cells because ah viruses are not alive. I like no no because if you take my interpretation things that can are recursively complicated copy number they can only produce by evolution.

### 📝 セクション 36

So what you don't do is you don't suddenly look at objects in the world and go is it living or not. You say was it produced by evolution or not? And so all the objects we know in the universe produc produced by evolution are the product of life and those objects that when you feed and give them energy and stuff and they can produce other objects. They are living. Now a virus becomes living in a cell but was produced by evolution and cells are kind of the minimum unit of life.

### 💡 セクション 37

So I think it's not it's nice to get away from this kind of hard lines to say look if you have an if you have a system that produces complexity above a threshold at scale only evolution could have done that and allows us to reframe the the gradient of life in the universe through selection and it unifies a lot of things like you know my iPhone here is a is um is ever is live is not living but it is life and what I mean by that is if there was no Steve Jobs, a living individual, and no Apple, there would be no iPhone. Same with my pink mouse. Someone designed it. If you went to Mars and you found 500 pink mice, you'd be like, "That's a bit weird. Why are there 500 pink mice on?" And I I don't quite have 500 pink mice, but I have three or four cuz I keep losing them.

### 🔧 セクション 38

[laughter] So, it's kind of like, so the definition of life is to say, don't think about metabolism and RNA D. think about is it complex and are there lots of identical copies? If that then you're good and it's a evidence of a living system. That was kind of my Eureka moment about I guess about seven years ago. >> That's very interesting.

### 🎯 セクション 39

That's a very different way of thinking about it like it's it's produced by life. Um so maybe it would help people also if we go back to the very formation of life. Most people think of like life emerged and then selection, you know, helped it become more complex. But it seems like you're saying that selection was happening maybe even before biology existed. Maybe can we unpack that a little bit?

### 💭 セクション 40

>> Yeah, my conjecture is really really simple and it causes everybody to kind of have a kind of a kind of psychotic break scientifically speaking. And and the reason for this is I'm I'm I am uh I'm I'm an a child in an adult's clothing. So I can just go around and just go, why you why does that work? Poke, poke, poke. Why does that work?

### 📌 セクション 41

Why does that work? And and and I've never lost the um the ability to annoy adults, particularly smart ones. And and and I think that that the the problem that we have in biology is biologists go evolution does everything and don't question it. and and they're right to say that because there is this creationist stuff and physicists are like saying physics does everything don't question it but then you have the poor old chemists in the middle that are joining chem physics to biology in a very precise way and the chemists are trying to come up with a story because that's what chemist chemists are really great at making molecules. So if they they've s they've given this living system and they're like how do these molecules get made?

### ✅ セクション 42

the chemist is like doing detective work and that's prebiotic chemistry and when I in terms of working out the plausible way and when I came into it and I wanted to solve the origin of life I didn't want to do prebiotic chemistry I want to come up with a genesis engine and I want to create life in the lab now right that's what I wanted to do and everyone's like what you're completely insane that's not possible and by the way what is life and you need to go backwards and you need to conform and the problem when I dug into it is I saw that the creationists are saying life is impossible because there is this massive leap in information required to go from sand to cells. But but actually if you say if selection was working before life then the natural aggregate the natural production of complexity on autonomy and the emergence of machinery and the ribosome and DNA and RNA in the cell is just a natural consequence of matter battling with the environment to persist over time and suddenly it pops up. And I think that what I've tried to say is like look selection is a force in the universe in the same way that stars are formed by gravity. You think about it load of hydrogen gravity pulls the hydrogen together. At some point gets hotter and hotter and hotter.

### 📚 セクション 43

It breaks a strong nuclear force and you get fusion. Now, if you're lucky and you have enough hydrogen, when it then expands and tries to blow up, there's enough gravity to stop it blowing up because there must be so many stars goof, [ __ ] wasn't enough gravity. So, it just goes. >> So, the process that gives rise to the sun is gravity. Um, the process that gives r gave rise to the first cells was selection.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Then, of course, when you have this autonomy in biology, you have biological selection and biological evolution. And when I first came up with the theory with my my colleagues and we said that selection is before biology, a lot of the biologists went crazy. And I was like, but if you're saying that selection couldn't occur before biology, you're you're basically saying we all creationists. And so I kind of got trapped between these things. So I think yes, that's a very long way of saying selection absolutely came first.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It's a force in the universe like gravity and it produces existence out of persistence. And I'm using those words purposely. Existence is a long Sorry, wrong way round. Damn it. But you could edit this, but you should leave it in to just show people how hard it is.

### 🚀 セクション 46

First of all, you exist. So you're real. You pop up. Wait, I exist. And then you exist for more than nancond.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So you persist. And in the universe, there is, forget selfish gene. There is selfish matter. There is matter that wants to persist in time for as long as possible. You know what is the oldest artifact on planet Earth?

### 🌟 セクション 48

Do you know? >> Artifact. Um like a volcano or something. I don't know. Like a rock.

### 🎬 セクション 49

>> Probably ecoli in your gut. It's 4.3 billion years. >> Yeah. Yeah. So it's an artifact, but it's also living.

### 📋 セクション 50

It's kind of cool, right? The ecoli in your you know that you have in the environment is or any cells they have been living since the origin of life 4.3 billion years ago. And that's mind-blowing, right? that this living thing that clearly is dying and turning over is the longest record of information that we have longer than most volcanoes, but maybe not longer than some, you know, moon rocks or something. >> One thing that really kind of for for me helped me maybe solidify this because I I think it's a little bit counterintuitive, I guess maybe is the right word.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Um, if you think about like what is more durable, a a chunk of granite, like a very hard rock or something like DNA, which is very, you know, easily destroyed. It's, you know, it gets too hot, too cold, whatever, it's gone. Uh, but if you think about it from a certain perspective, the DNA, anything that's like can replicate itself is going to be more durable because it's able to persist much longer. The granite has only one outcome. Eventually, it will collapse into dust.

### 📝 セクション 52

the DNA could multiply and become more complex and just stick around forever like the E.coli in our gut that's been around for much longer than a lot of maybe metals and rocks that that we've seen. So, I just want to kind of like uh put a pin in that for for later, but yeah. >> Yeah, you nailed it. I think that's really great. I think durable is a well, I mean, granite is clearly more durable than DNA, but over infinite time, DNA is.

### 💡 セクション 53

It's a brilliant analogy. >> It will persist longer. That's what kind of clicked for me. I'm like, "Oh, okay, that makes sense." Okay, Dylan, sorry. Go ahead.

### 🔧 セクション 54

>> Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I mean, so I guess I guess gravity is like the original selection pressure, the first thing that made these suns, but um so maybe you could explain what assembly theory is. Is that the kind of overall thing that goes all the way from gravity to where we're at? And then also, where in that chain does intelligence show up?

### 🎯 セクション 55

>> Yeah, I think there's a there's a lot. I've I worked out the chain a few weeks ago with my collaborator Sarah Walker and we were trying to figure this out. We worked out we've got an idea. So yeah, assembly theory um was um kind of born out of this kind of how do we define life and measure it and um I kind of just realized that there was something more to it as it went going. So what I originally did is um I'm a chemist so I should have said it again.

### 💭 セクション 56

Regious professor of chemistry and um but I always wanted to be um you know not just doing chemistry I want to do theory computer science mathematics physics just wanted to hack around all the disciplines I want why annoy chemists when you can annoy physicists and computer sciences and biologists at the same time you know there's much more fun and I just love talking to smart people from different disciplines because you can get them to do things you know together you know so I just asked a very simple question a few years ago which was um um what What is the most complicated molecule I could show you? And you and you'll be go, "Oh my gosh, that that molecule cannot arise by chance." Right. So, is it a bit of RNA? Is it is it um you know, some kind of diamond? >> Exactly.

### 📌 セクション 57

Like what? And so, and they said, "Oh, that's kind of cool. So, how do we actually how can I can compare a molecule that's complicated or not?" And well, all molecules are connected are a a definition of a molecule is basically, you know, set of atoms. is when you get them together they have an attraction so they can basically survive some energy. So they have B and the way they do this is they have bonds right and chemists understand the abstraction and the reality of the chemical bond.

### ✅ セクション 58

So molecules are literally atoms glued together by bonds and those bonds have an energy and you have to put in energy to break them. So that's quite good. So it's a bit like glue. So you're like okay good. So what molecule can I have that's really a proof of life and then and then if I go down simple simple simple simple say to a molecule like water which is just H2O one oxygen two hydrogen's or methane CH4 one carbon four hydrogen's those molecules are important for life but they're not proof of life because they've been made naturally so what had been happening is we've been looking for evidence of life in the universe oxygen and methane and so on I was like well but they're really simple there's oxygen and methane and everywhere in the universe.

### 📚 セクション 59

What we want to do is find a smoking gun that would really be proof like a you know a DNA a Micho a Michelangelo artifact of a molecule. And so um I started thinking and I realized that there are these molecules called natural products that you can get out of biology that are like well morphine, CBDs. So most of your your uh your listeners viewers will be kind of know what um opiates are. So like you know the natural poppy plant producing and also canniboids right from the from cannabis plants and so on. Um and so these are molecules that are produced by biology.

### 🔖 セクション 60

There are other molecules we can make but and they have lots of parts. So what I realized and it was this is when I annoyed discipline number one because I was like now there's a molecule I'm going to I and I and I'm you know I'm a closet mathematician or want to be like I want to do some math. So I I took the molecules and I took them apart and I tried to kind of work out way compressing the molecule and I and current and the compression systems that were out there didn't work. And I realized that if I cut the molecule into the parts and look for reuse and I put it all in a line because I'm really lazy. I want to lay out my parts in a line.

### 🎨 セクション 61

I don't want to have to go back to the beginning. I realized I could do a thing called recursion. So I could basically take a molecule, take a bit off, take a bit off, take a bit off. And I realized I could make a shortest path where I could have all minimum building blocks and I could add a you know them together and know have the knowledge once I've added it together I have that knowledge so I can then carry it to the next step with no penalty or minimum penalty. And by doing that I was able to basically count the number of steps I needed to make molecule A versus molecule B.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So I came up with a new counting scheme and this annoyed the computer scientists because normally they use a thing called zip to compress things right and they were like no that's wrong you should use zip and I was like but zip doesn't have cause it doesn't have recursion in it and I realized the recursion is really produced by causation at that time I didn't know I was just like this looks quite good I came up the assembly index I basically would made an algorithm that I chucked in a molecule and it give me a number I was like oh that's So I've got all these molecules. I just took all the molecules I could and just counted their calculated their assembly index. So I calculated them. So large molecules with lots of different parts had a high assembly index. Small molecules with not very many parts had a lowest assembly index.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Great. And then I realized one day when I was talking to one of my colleagues, a student, that I could actually um take the molecule and put it in a machine where I just basically hit the molecule with lots of energy and it falls apart. And I if I count the number of parts, I thought, could the number of parts somehow be the same number as the number of parts I calculated in my theory? And I was like, nah, that ain't going to work. I went and did it and it worked.

### 🌟 セクション 64

I was like [ __ ] really. So I kept doing this and I was like oh so complicated molecules that have this high assembly index as I calculated in theory I could do experiment and measure it. So then I went okay great maybe that high numbers mean life and no low numbers mean dead. So then I started to basically get um samples from the environment from volcanoes from meteorites from the seabed. NASA gave me some moon samples and all sorts of stuff, right?

Merchants of meteorites and then they gave me um ones from uh fossils and they didn't tell me they double blinded them. And when we basically took all these samples from all around the un you know the universe from space from earth d and we put them and we blew them apart and we count the number of parts we then able to get sample A low small number of parts high number of parts you know sample A low sample B large number of parts sample C low D and they were all blinded and we said we then said oh that looks like it's dead it's live dead alive dead alive dead alive and then we gave to NASA and we did the big unveil and we were 100% correct. We were able to predict using this technique called mass spectrometry or mass spectroscopy with whether a sample had been produced by life or not. And that was how assembly theory was born where you have the theory for counting the parts of the molecule and then the experiment for measuring it and it just blew everything apart. >> Wow, that is so that that's incredibly interesting.

### 📋 セクション 66

So this is idea of causality and some sort of a memory. So as things build up in complexity, we're able to say at some point, okay, past this line, it's likely to be life once it has enough parts. Oh, that's so I'm curious and I don't know if these two things connect, but just wanted to ask you. So for example, with uh Google Deep Mind Alphafold, right, they fed all the 3D structures of all the proteins that we've discovered very slowly um and it was able to predict the 3D structures of some proteins that we didn't know. Um, so I I always was fascinated by that because I'm like, what does that mean?

### ⭐ セクション 67

Does that mean that there's some sort of a pattern uh to how proteins fold in order to be to have some sort of a function? Does this connect in any way to what you're talking about like there's some underlying pattern or Yeah, for sure. For sure. That's a really nice way of putting it. I mean, like I'm you probably know me.

### 📝 セクション 68

I'm normally a downer on all AI, but the thing I love about Alpha Fold and a lot of these systems is like although although they don't necessarily know physics, these AIs, what they're able to do if you have clean representations in clean data, you can then basically look at correlations and those correlations are not magic. They come from somewhere. So pro the protein the reason why protein folding prediction works is because the evolution of proteins is happening in the causal system. So that's a beautiful example to say the alpha fold if you come up with a sequence that is then and relying on an in distribution prediction you're going to come up with a very nice 3D structure that's likely to be very close to what you would actually get and that's because the system if you like learned is I don't like using the word learn because learn means understanding to me but I would maybe use represent or encodes um a latent space of folding. So, and and it represent it decompresses it to that which is amazing.

### 💡 セクション 69

And I think if it wasn't for that causation because the way protein folding works is you like you have a let's say you have a nucle sorry you got like you got the you know the ribosome and out comes the first nucleation site and you grow grow grow grow grow and as you grow out the amino acids they rotate and they and they fold and they and they basically start to condense and then then you you literally print the protein out it goes right into the big wide world. That step of adding in the se the amino acids in sequence allows the structure to evolve in time, remove the water molecules and compress itself and be ready for action. That process is super amazing. um and is also is very causal because you have this the genome has recorded the past what's happened and the genome every time it's read is unraveling that causation and making units ability to then go out and act in the world and so you're absolutely right it's very it's a very nice way of putting it actually >> so if we have an understanding of sort of how much complexity is needed to find something like truly alien and we can start diverting resources away from looking for like methane or H2O as the precursors because it might be a waste of energy and direct it towards some kind of other tool. What could you imagine potentially building to detect now that we kind of know what we're looking for a little bit better like aliens or something of higher level complexity out in the universe?

### 🔧 セクション 70

So, so if we're going to do go nearby and we're going to go to our, you know, Mars, um, and also maybe to the outer solar system a bit further away as well, we could go and send mass spectrometers. And in fact, just so happens, you wouldn't, you couldn't make this up. It's great. Um, people at JPL are going to send a nuclearpowered drone to Titan, right? like literally a drone like imagine a DJI drone but rather than being powered by a lithium battery it's powered by a plug a slug of plutonium right >> and they're going to send that in a couple of years it's called Dragonfly >> and literally it's a mass spectrometer with wings well with roses and t they're going to fly around Titan and just sniff the local environment and so it's going to basically image the entire uh moon with this mass spec and I'm really excited cuz I'm like guys you don't need to change your design of your machine or anything just get me the data so we can apply assembly theory to it to see if we can sniff some aliens on Titan.

### 🎯 セクション 71

So mass spectrometer is one. The other thing that I did when I mean I've had so much push back, right? You know, many people still think that what I'm saying is completely wrong and it's all nonsensical and I'm just making it up which is fine. You know, science is a bit like that. But addition to mass spec that where where mass what mass spec does is you weigh the molecule and then you cut it up and you just look at the the reduction of weight and then you recombine it.

### 💭 セクション 72

There's another technique called infrared spectroscopy where you shine light And it's a bit like, I don't know, a a someone with a with a with a a cloak of different um that absorbs light. And you know, if you have an invisibility cloak, it absorbs all the light, doesn't it? >> But if you have an invisibility cloak that doesn't quite absorb all the light, you can work out where it's absorbing. So, so what I've worked out is that I thought that using infrared radiation where molecules absorb, if you can count the number of lines the molecule absorbs, you can count the assembly index. And we did that as well and it works.

### 📌 セクション 73

In fact, I've come up with a design for if we go if we if we want to go out and basically cloak ourselves, I've come up with a concept of what I call a non-gravitational lensing complexity cloak, which is a very fancy way of saying I'll take a big sheet of carbon, very light, like a sail, but I'll put lots of different bonds in so absorbs all the radiation from the gamma ray to the infrared. So, it would just look like a dark blob in the sky. And if you do it really properly, you should maybe look at just emitting the microwave background. So it just looks like a bit of microwave background moving away. And that would be one way to basically, you know, if you've got a complexity cloak, you could literally take all the radiation, absorb it, turn it into microwave radiation.

### ✅ セクション 74

So you could really, you know, that's probably what the Klingons had, right? Or whatever it is. >> Cloaking devices. >> Yeah, something like that. But what I'm saying is be the reason why molecules absorb different lines, they have different parts.

### 📚 セクション 75

So the more parts the more colors you absorb and and that worked as well and I was like wow this is getting to the point where and because in chemistry no one had done this before no one had realized that complexity is intrinsic measurable part of molecules and it's still like 2 years old so you know it's not I get abuse that's unfair I don't get abuse what I get is criticism and and and just to to tell your you know the people watching this or listening to this criticism is a necessary very part of science. It's not bad, right? Criticism is a good sign. Um, unless you're just completely wrong, then it's a bad sign. >> Or maybe just sometimes resistance because people already have money and they've already worked in a certain direction and just to change there's like an opportunity cost that seems hard for them to change.

### 🔖 セクション 76

>> For sure. >> Oh, yes. Yeah. I was thinking we just uh recently talked to a few people that are scientists and that they do have crit criticism and it's usually because they're doing something that's uh triggers maybe some fear in in in people that's it's a little bit different. So I mean this is very common I think that I'm certainly you know we mentioned Fineman I feel like he probably annoyed people as well because he uh went against the grain so to speak.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Um but I guess so in order to start approaching um AI and what it does right, what it does wrong, whether we're going to get AGI um you know I mean maybe can we start with because what I am noticing a lot of people first of all have either no definition of intelligence that they can like test or explain fully. Um reasoning is another word that people don't get understand uh in order to understand something. What is understanding truly means? You know you use the terminology you know maybe it's encoding something in a latent space but that's different from understanding. So maybe can we start with maybe unpacking like what is intelligence when we're talking for like for scientists for engineers not philosophers like if you're an engineer how do we define intelligence?

### 🚀 セクション 78

You have to have a philosophical background, right? One of the people I was talking to earlier today was a philosopher. I don't agree that you should ignore philosophers, but I think philosophers, philosophers can't ignore scientists and engineers. So, I think you're right to ask from an engineering point of view. Um, so intelligence is a super interesting thing.

### ⚡ セクション 79

And the problem is, right, so our current evolution at AI, there's a lot of stuff out there where people are just basically peddling stuff because they're selling stuff. So, I'm not going to bother complaining about that because it happens everywhere, right? I don't think that's productive. you guys are acting in good faith in this stuff. So I'll give you some views I think might be useful for people um kind of taking part listening to this.

### 🌟 セクション 80

So intelligence in a way is a is produ if we let's all go back and say what what is the causal chain of intelligence the universe the only intelligence we know in the universe is you go back and say origin of life it starts there then you have the cells that kind of differentiate and you go you know go from single cell creatures to multisellular creatures and then when multisellular creatures started to sense the environment they had this problem where they can't because intelligence before intelligence there was just evolution what I mean cell is mutated. If it's if it's lucky, it can continue. If it's unlucky, it dies. Right? So you have this kind of instantaneous evolution.

### 🎬 セクション 81

So evolution is like, "Huh, you're dead. I'm sorry. You're alive. Great. Continue." But as soon as you become multisellular, you start to sense things.

### 📋 セクション 82

And if you can see your predator coming in real time, you're like, "Oh [ __ ] I'm about to get eaten." Um, and maybe you're seeing someone else get eaten. You remember what happened. We want to survive so you can get out of the way. >> Mhm. >> So then you create a memory.

### ⭐ セクション 83

So if you've got and I'm doing this, I've actually written these notes down and you're the first people to hear these notes. Not for this. It's just I was working with Sarah on what intelligence was and we were trying to figure out how to put it in order because you have all these things. So evolution gives you sensing real time. You get memory and then for for all that to work you have to have a thing called consciousness because consciousness you need to be aware of your surroundings.

### 📝 セクション 84

And also consciousness is important because you access the past memories. So in a way where so you kind of remember what happened and you can then see what's going on and then you have a thing called imagination where you can imagine being eaten or imagine getting away or imagine doing this or imagine doing that. So you can see how you've got this hierarchy of evolution sensing in real time memory conscious and imagination. And then you have free will. And free will then allows you to make a decision.

### 💡 セクション 85

And that the sum total of that is what intelligence is. And you can see that there's a lot in there because free will is an intrinsic part of intelligence. So sorry John. >> No, no, please. So, u this is a little bit less less of a question and just something that uh over the last couple years I was excited to have the opportunity to share with you is um man, maybe you'd want to run this by Sarah, maybe not.

### 🔧 セクション 86

But the one thing that's occurred to me is a lot of times in computer science you come across this question about exploitation versus exploration. And there's all sorts of equations that tell you the exact amount of times to pull like a slot machine before you move on to the next machine because you're discovering how much it pays out. And on the lowest level of intelligence, I've had some thoughts that maybe one way you could kind of look into this or kind of a northstar you could kind of think about would be if a system knows to stop exploiting itself like a bacteria that will just eat all the food in the petri dish and then die of starvation. Um is, you know, exploiting its its food too much and the idea that understanding the environment enough to start exploring and slow down seems like something. Um, have you ever thought about exploration versus exploitation in any of your work?

### 🎯 セクション 87

>> Yeah, I think that's so I have and I think that's a really nice insight and I would actually add another label on is it living systems tend to be curious but curious I think curiosity is born of you've just kind of crystallized it here just now. So curiosity is what happens when exploitation and exploration are balanced because why are systems curious? What's the evolutionary? Because if you're too curious, you die. But if you're curious, you're storing up new information for the future.

### 💭 セクション 88

So you have, you know, pesky kids coming, go out, do that thing, and you know, like, why do you press that switch? What was, you know, or why did I do that? Well, I wanted to see what happened. And so I think curiosity is this balance between exploration and exploitation that allows you to then put something in your memory, go, "Oh, I know if I do that, do this." And and so it's almost a bit like the reason why evolution is currently creating new technologies, new competitions and things is we're all trying to out compete one another. And the only way to get those seeds, those novelty to compete is to basically be curious.

### 📌 セクション 89

And that curiosity is basically when I've done enough exploitation, I need to do some exploration. But I don't want to do so much exploration that I go off peace and die. So I go back and do exploitation. So you have this kind of balance between the two. And so I think that's a nice way of putting it.

### ✅ セクション 90

I mean I I I I hesitate to do too much computer science analogization if that's even a word. Apologies. But actually that um even if it's just a metaphor it's a beautiful one and actually I think it's quite significant because you know living systems that are curious are ones that would be I I would say is a unique identifier for intelligence. Object objects that have free will and curiosity are uniquely intelligent and that's how I would measure it. You see what I mean?

### 📚 セクション 91

>> Mhm. That's kind of cool. AB. >> Yeah, absolutely. Um, so just one thing from the earlier.

### 🔖 セクション 92

So we went from evolution to sensing to memory. So that makes perfect sense, right? Develop some sensing proteins in our eyes, picking out photons, whatever. Then some sort of a way to store that information, memory. Then we go to consciousness.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Can we touch on that for a second? Because that seems to be another big foundational thing before intelligence, before free will. How do we define consciousness? How do we test for consciousness? Um because that's going to be a big question right now because there's some people are saying there's no way these systems are conscious.

### 🚀 セクション 94

Uh and I'm not saying they are. I'm saying how do we in order for us to say they're not, don't we need to have a test or some like I'm not arguing that they are, but how can we say we're not if they're not if we can't even test for it? So maybe can we unpack consciousness a little bit? >> Yeah. Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 95

So the way I would get there, it's a good point is I think a lot of these come together like memory, imagination. So memory, consciousness, imagination, and free will are kind of bundled together in layers. So I would say the only way I can think of really measuring consciousness is by the amount of imagination. So if I went to chat GPT I I've already built an assembly theory based consciousness measuring system and and all the all the AIs fail because they don't do any because what happens is you basically know what's in your in the envir you know what's in the environment that's what you've learned on that's your model right that's all the data so you kind of know how to be surprised or not so you know when you're applying the gen AI it looks cool we feel emotionally responsive because we can't know everything that's why humans respond in weird ways to AIS, but you can see it's flat when there's act of creativity. Um, it just it just spikes.

### 🌟 セクション 96

So, so I I think what I'm saying is consciousness and imagination and free will need to bundle together to give you intelligence and in that layer. And but I'm this is very new to me, but I would the argument I would have is that the only way you can measure intelligence in a and and we'll define it, right? Because like people argue with me, oh that these things are intelligent. I'm like, no, no, you that's not that's not intelligence. But but I'm not de mirroring.

### 🎬 セクション 97

I'm not but I'm not looking down on it. I'm just saying intelligence is where you can in real time solve a problem using your free will, imagination, curiosity. And all the systems we've created thus far don't have that. But they're amazing tools, right? And it's just the word AI is just such a bad word.

### 📋 セクション 98

If we called it anything else, we like look at that widget. It really does this thing. It's cool. It's like, yeah, let's use the widget. But the fact that we're that we're exploiting the widget and kind of amprophorphizing causes a great deal of complexity.

### ⭐ セクション 99

But coming back to your point, I would measure consciousness by measuring and therefore also degree of intelligence if you like >> by imagination. Now dogs are conscious. How do I measure the imagination of a dog? That's not so easy, right? So it's clear that what I'm telling you is not fully formed.

### 📝 セクション 100

But for humans who have language because then the next thing on my list is like you have memory, consciousness, imagination, free will. And only then are you able to make language. Language is only comes from people from things that have free will that have had imagination have consciousness. And that is super interesting because you imagine a bunch of people going before they had language, but they were they were conscious. They had memory.

### 💡 セクション 101

They were like and then and you can see that they would then converge on um sounds that they could use to represent things and then when they became true incomplete they extended them and you brought in the alphabet and all that stuff and we have everything today. So we're kind of like trapped in not understanding the history of life. And one of the things why I'm so um I feel so passionate about getting involved in AI discussions is that understanding the origin of life and the emergence of of kind of multisellularity is the only way we're going to really understand intelligence as a standalone phenomena in our culture. It's really important to work out where we are and where we're going. Sorry, that's a really long statement.

### 🔧 セクション 102

No, that's really good. Well, I mean, one of the things that seems so fascinating about uh AI when it's built in certain ways, it seems like it almost predicts the future. You know what I mean? Like it sometimes intelligence seems like it's about noticing patterns and saying like, okay, if those patterns have kept so far, I predict with high probability this will happen next. And that's kind of what's happening with next tokens and uh in different aspects of AI like that.

### 🎯 セクション 103

But I've heard you say in another podcast that the future is not in principle predictable. Um maybe you could help me reconcile what was that in a different context or what do you mean by the future is not in principle predictable? >> Yeah. So this is where novelty comes from. So we have this ridic so so there are there are macroscopic so totally right.

### 💭 セクション 104

So the future is not predictable. If the future was predictable then um well would be boring right obvious but what I mean by that is obviously there are there are there's regularities but we shouldn't confuse regularities with predictions so what I say is that the thing about large language models and all the AI they're really brilliant at predicting the past right which is kind of like what it's like almost like a projorative like well because always happened right it it probabilities only work when you have um data that you can basically mine and then calculate on and and and so let me ask your question directly. This is super interesting. So if I'm going into a situation that is basically happened before then I can then use that data to predict what may happen. So, like I like the idea of going in and going say in Las Vegas, let's say we go gambling, we go to some slot machines, right?

### 📌 セクション 105

I know what's going to happen. The slot machine isn't suddenly going to turn into an alien and I don't know come up with a port hole gun and take me to see Rick and Morty. It's a slot machine. Although maybe right what's in my on my head. However, if I basically go to a completely new environment that is unknown to me and maybe unknown to and I bring together lots of new things that never happened before, I can't predict what's going to happen probabilistically.

### ✅ セクション 106

I can conjecture to what's going to happen in a possibility space. Let's say I'm go right, I've never built, I don't know, let's invent a new thing. Let's combine a 747 with a Starship. It's kind of interesting. So we take the Starship and we just make a bulbous bit and say it's never been done before.

### 📚 セクション 107

We can imagine it. It's probably be when it launches it be a bit lopsided. 747 Starship. We might put the engines on. It won't make a difference cuz the starship is so powerful.

### 🔖 セクション 108

So I can imagine in my possibility space in my brain if I can combine architectures together what that might look like but I can't really predict what's going to happen except by using some you know um architectural approaches. So if I'm going into environment that is basically fairly known to me, I can predict. When I'm going into environments where there's lots of um uh um there's lot there's there's not very many parameters defined and lots are happening then the novelty is higher. And so what I'm saying is in those and this is like you know I'm kind of saying to people use AI to mine the past. It's a great search tool.

### 🎨 セクション 109

AI if you want to use it in the best way is a search tool. In the worst way it is a bullshitting tool where you basically get confabulations back and you don't look at it critically. So you just basically you know I'm going to write a document using AI. Here's my document. Give it to someone.

### 🚀 セクション 110

You haven't read it. they read it and go, "Oh, that's interesting fact." And take it as fact and clearly they then use that to put into their AI and before you know it, you've just got confabulation on confabulation. That's not a very good use of the tool and because that tool is probabilistically sampling the past and giving you a new outcome. But the nice thing you get from that probabilistic sampling is you get an incredible um ability to access such a huge space of data and your chances of getting things sensible is quite high. So someone said to me like you know you're on a desert island you've got no encyclopedias but you got chat GPT or no chat GPT.

### ⚡ セクション 111

I'd take chat GPT every time because I would then go you know what temperature does water boil at and be like well you know this. I'll be like I can check that feels right. I can do it. Interrogate. And so we have this issue with misunderstanding what GI does.

### 🌟 セクション 112

It's framed on the past. But did chat GPT predict that Putin was going to invade Ukraine? Well, actually probably did. It's happened quite a lot the time before actually. That's probably a bad example.

### 🎬 セクション 113

But, you know, let's think of something, you know, really bizarre that we weren't expecting. Some kind of technological miracle or some kind of political event, right? you know, I don't know, Trump's second term for his first term. I don't know if Chat GPT would have predicted that. So, we've got this kind of interplay between um the amount of information we have in the past that gives us regularities that we can predict on and then possibilities that we cannot possibly know.

### 📋 セクション 114

And so, running simultaneously, we have a probability space and we have a possibility space. Who would have thought that Elon Musk would have landed a [ __ ] rock? Excuse my swearing. Am I allowed to square? >> Absolutely.

### ⭐ セクション 115

Absolutely. >> You can say who would imagine that Elon Musk would have landed a rocket on some chopsticks. I mean, I didn't think of that. That wasn't in my probability space, but it was certainly in Elon Musk possibility space. So, I think there is this interplay of those two things together.

### 📝 セクション 116

I think is super interesting. One doesn't usurp the other. They just serve different process, different purposes. >> Absolutely. I'm curious to think uh to to to to know what you think about this.

### 💡 セクション 117

So for example with some of the most interesting AI projects out of Google DeepMind for example um Alpha Evolve they used Gemini right their version of Chad GPT to uh solve various math problems to optimize some hardware optimize how their data centers run and they would ask it for you know how how would you do this and it gave them you know a thousand different answers and most of them or some of them were complete BS like you said it's a you know [ __ ] producer But like you said, some of them were viable. And so for each one, they would test it against some known metric like right oh if it if this ID improves it based on this metric then um then we continue down that path. So it's almost like an evolutionary tree search where the things die off. Um and I mean they did have some very sort of um seemingly interesting breakthroughs with that. So in so there these neural these AIs would be very useful as long as we can just push them through this evolutionary research because them being able to be us and come up with a million different ideas actually kind of helps in that sense right so they could be very powerful with that but they're still not what intelligence is right >> yeah yeah so look I think I I mean it be it's kind of good for me to kind of clarify my stance on AI in general AI is incredibly powerful But it's a probabilistic representation of things right now.

### 🔧 セクション 118

What I know what Demis is trying, he wants to solve intelligence, he's doing it wrong. The only way he's going to solve intelligence is solve origin of life. Um because we don't know the features in the brain, the mechanics in the brain that understands probability and possibility. But coming back to what you're saying about alpha evolve, alpha evolve is very good. It comes up with solutions that we as humans with agency because we're the only known source of agency in the universe.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Maybe your dog if you have pets. Pets do right at mult complex multisellular creatures have agency and AI has none and it's never going to have it. Not in the current architecture and I'm pretty confident of that which is kind of kind of makes people sad and angry and whatever. They have various debates and we could get into why I'm so confident because you know when anyone's confident of something they're always going to be wrong but I think I can give you a a reason a a good principled reason. So, Alvolve is good, but it's evolving in a digital world, which means this environment isn't necessarily boring.

### 💭 セクション 120

The the really interesting thing about the real world is it's continuous. And when you basically then sample the real world, you make a decision to label it. And when and how does that happen? There is a mystery. There's so many mysteries we talked about.

### 📌 セクション 121

So the mystery is when you sample the real world and you basically decide to vinerize it and then you then take that into your model and then decide on it that gives you something and then if you go and do it again you get something different because what we are falling into the trap of is we think that AIs have anywhere near the creativity or potentiality of living systems. They are nothing. They are nothing compared to living systems. They are zero. And if you say to most people, they're like, they're like, "Oh my god, but I can do this thing." And I'm like, and what I mean by zero, I mean a very very very very small number of the possibility space.

### ✅ セクション 122

That doesn't mean they're not useful. They're incredibly useful. But and and if you give Alpha Evolve a problem, you know, an expectation value and an environment, it will get there. And why not why not use it? It's like using linear regression or nonlinear regression.

### 📚 セクション 123

The mathematics works. gradient descent works, but that is not intelligence. Intelligence is something we don't yet understand, and I'm not sure that we're ever going to understand it by using a computational neuroscience approach because the brain is not a computer. >> Okay. So, yeah, I would love to hear why won't AI have agency?

### 🔖 セクション 124

And then also, when you use the word agency, is that the same as as free will? Like, do you believe people have free will? >> Yeah. So then let's recap because I really like this very powerful. If you have memory and consciousness and imagination, you can have free will.

### 🎨 セクション 125

That's kind of cool because I think that's something that we haven't yet we can program in the illusion of agency into an a this is why agents it's like it's like I feel like I've grown into a nightmare like artificial intelligence. No, it's not intelligence. Then you got agents. I'm like no they're not agents but I get it. So it's like you're like damn it.

### 🚀 セクション 126

So of course you can we have things called agents that we can give a complex tree search to and if they're not too brittle they will do stuff but you know um agency is um is a thing that a I I'm guessing at the moment I don't know what it is other than I know in other humans where I can see it and again in in higher primates and animals and so on and so agency really comes from your need, your wish to survive. And if you're a if you're a multisellular organism with memory, conscious, imagination, free will, you tend to want to survive, right? You do stuff, you think ahead, you got agency, you have you have such complicated cert, you know, of wants and requirements. So, it's very difficult to kind of, you know, to tease those apart. You can flatten them and shout GPT does it in the therapy mode, right?

is just, you know, I can hack anyone, but same way I can hack anyone's like, I'm, you know, I can flatter you and I can say you're the best person in the world, you've done all this wonderful thing and you're good-looking, you're really intelligent and, you know, I what GBT does, right? It's this kind of this, but agency is a very special thing that comes from this free will. And yes, of course, no computer systems have ever displayed it. In fact, one of my dreams is to create a artificial form that has its own agency. A friend of mine who I'm very much inspired by, a computer scientist called Susan Stephanie.

### 🌟 セクション 128

She told me when I was going into our official life world, she said that her dream was to write a computer program and run it and be so excited and so surprised by the outcome of the program that she would think the act of turning off the computer would be an act of murder. an act of murder. I was like, "Holy [ __ ] >> that's so interesting." So, and and ever since I had that conversation with her, like I guess it was probably 15 years ago, I was thinking, >> "How could I create a life form that had memory and conscious, imagination, free will, and intelligence." And, you know, not that I want to basically euthanize it or something, right? But, but I would simply feel um that I would like do anything I can to make sure that entity survived. because it's a precious thing.

### 🎬 セクション 129

It's a living thing. Um, and yeah, and AIS don't have that. And this is the problem with AGI and all the other stuff we have right now because it's not that it's not a it's not that AGI is not a worthy thing. We just keep mislab labeling it. And the only thing that's happening here is the tech bros are trying to sell us stuff and they are and they are in charge of the funding.

### 📋 セクション 130

So the academics and the scientists and the technicians are kind of beholden and they have to basically they have to basically worship at the altar of the AGI or they get nothing. So like I feel kind of annoyed that we you know the printing press what did the freaking printing press do? Printed the Bible and gave everyone the Bible. What have we done when we've we've got the answer to basically processing vast amounts of data? We make chat bots and make everyone think they're smart.

### ⭐ セクション 131

It's like damn it. >> Yeah. from a social context, I am very frustrated with the terminology that we use and the way that it's sold to us and that whole thing. But um before I before I go down that that direction, just one last question. Um like on your Santa Fe Institute profile, I guess that you say something about wet chemical computers.

### 📝 セクション 132

Um, I just had a thought that if if you were to take something like neurons and put them in some sort of giant petri dish type thing and use that as an AI learning system in that case, in that hypothetical case, would it then be able to have consciousness and agency because it's chemical in nature? >> Yeah. You just Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm actually I have a uh a project or it's called Chem Machina, but it's going to turn into living circuits where I'm like, okay, you know, I'm okay.

### 💡 セクション 133

Okay, Deis, you think you're going to solve intelligence that way? Okay, cool. That's really smart. You have a Nobel Prize. You're a genius.

### 🔧 セクション 134

You work for deep mind. I'll take a different approach. So if I can try and understand origin of life and then work out how chemistry gets to intelligence, one possible way of doing it might be to um to say well why can't I try and instantiate a type of learning system in chemistry and then look at the difference between the chemical system and the brain. And so it seems plausible that we can get there. But for all the reasons I told you why AI sorry intelligence doesn't seem yet evident in in the systems we program I would think we should be simly cautious to my approach because it hasn't evolved all the way back but it might get us a step closer or it might be an add-on it might be something else because the nice thing about having a blob of chemistry you know if you think about let's go back to what the brain is the brain is few kilograms of neurons what there's about 120 trillion neurons I think And each neuron has 10,000 connections.

### 🎯 セクション 135

So that means in your brain alone, there are more potential connections possible that you could do when you're thinking, imagining stuff than there are atoms in the universe just in your brain. Now that's your brain is moving. It's morphing. It's thinking. You take a silicon chip.

### 💭 セクション 136

It ain't morphing. It ain't moving. You got electrons on it going into registers and things, but your brain has a configurational space bigger than the universe when you're thinking. That's that literally blows my mind. And that's why I'm not scared of AGI in in silicon right now.

### 📌 セクション 137

But I'm like, okay, damn it. I watched Pickle Rick and Rick and Morty. And actually after that episode, I was like, can I make an electrochemical brain and a pickle? And I did. I did one in this workshop actually where I'm in right now.

### ✅ セクション 138

>> And all I did is I I I basically put the pickle at 240 volts. So it was almost exploding because of steam. And I put in some low voltage electrodes and I tried to basically make a little circuit where I could teach the pickle to re to tell the difference between a triangle and a circle. That was easy, right? And it was able to do it.

### 📚 セクション 139

>> Wow. >> Like how does it do that? Well, pickle is like it's got water, it's got fibers, there's sodium potassium moving around. I was like, "Okay, so what I need to do is make a gel, a brain gel where I can put electrodes in and tickle them and then that basically they would grow and basically interact and I could read out the response of the electrodes from inputs. So that's where living circuits got born.

### 🔖 セクション 140

So so it's just happening in the ne you know in the next few years the idea is to make a machine learning system that's all chemical and that's where the chemical computers come from and I think I don't know if I've got one of my one of Yeah. So this is one of the one of the 3D grids I 3D printed which is basically a matrix of chemical reactors you can see and the idea is to put chemical oscillations in this in this grid and basically make a small chemical brain in this but you know it's kind of funny it's just behind me. >> Yeah, dude Wes Wes you'll have to tell him about Butterbench. I feel like that's the perfect benchmark to see when he succeeded. >> Oh there's Oh my I have so many notes I want to come back to.

### 🎨 セクション 141

>> You remember the Rick and Morty episode where he's like you pass butter. That's That's the Yeah, Rick and Morty, a lot of these projects, they they they kind of like reference it a little bit, which I I absolutely love. Somebody else is making um they're using human and rat neurons to teach them in a petri dish to play the video game Doom. So, I do I do want to come back to everything that you're doing. Kim Mahina is such a great name.

### 🚀 セクション 142

Uh but I maybe it's not an easier name would be more memorable for people, but I I I just want to come back to one thing that we were talking about. So um you know cuz you're saying that because AI and maybe that's a wrong term AI agents doesn't they don't have agency AI doesn't have intelligence but certainly they they they have they have something that is able to do work now in this um if if we kind of think about that that might be the best possible outcome for us because we have these amazing tools that can do a lot but because they they don't have agency they don't have true intelligence a lot of the AI doomer arguments kind of fall apart because no matter how good it gets at running through whatever, you know, information it's helping us with, it's never going to like come alive and have a sense of self-preservation and then attack us to to get the resources or whatever. >> It's just nonsense. Yeah. Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 143

>> Can we talk about that? Like um so you're you're not worried about Skynet or uh uh Xrisk from it going rogue specifically? That's not even not nothing to worry about, right? >> Well, let me I phrased that wrong. Yeah.

### 🌟 セクション 144

Sorry. >> No, no, no. You you you you asked a question. Nothing to Yes. I don't think there's anything to worry about, but let's do it so we can convince people listening to this.

### 🎬 セクション 145

I one of the things I don't like about the doomers is literally they're looking for attention and like Eliza, I don't know what's got with him. I, you know, I wanted to try and debate him. He blocked me on Twitter and all sorts of things, but what he says is like and then you're going to die. I'm like, >> okay. So, my counter to that is to say there's so many things we could die of in in the world, right?

### 📋 セクション 146

And you know, um I let's think about it. If if we didn't have the stupid anti-uclear movement, we would have fast speeder nuclear reactors all around the planet just now. We'd have no energy problems, right? In we don't have an energy problem as is, but we're just burning more fossil fuel than we need to. In the UK, we have 300 tons of plutonium at solar field.

### ⭐ セクション 147

300 tons. That's a trillion dollars worth of energy that we could just put through fast breeders. What happened is all the doomers went, "Oh, no. We're all going to die." So, no nuclear reactors, right? The only country that's really got its stuff together was France and then it's got obviously China and also the US actually.

### 📝 セクション 148

Huge amount of nuclear infrastructure. Not very talked about. So Eliza says, "Okay, you know, AGI only has to get there once. It'll kill us." I'm like, "But you don't even have a functioning definition." So I I want to make I made up a count of one. Say, "Right, I'm afraid of AG." What is AG?

### 💡 セクション 149

AG is anti-gravity. If I create anti-gravity in my workshop behind me and it replicates, suddenly everything's going to float away. We're all gonna die. Scary, right? Could happen tomorrow, right?

### 🔧 セクション 150

Well, you might go, "Well, what is anti-gravity?" Well, I've told you. And you're like, "Okay, give me the mechanism by which anti-gravity is going to do its thing." And that's where I fall flat. And so what all the doomers are doing, they're literally making stuff up because there is no mechanism by which an AGI can become super intelligent, get control of the systems, have agency, and do anything. It is nonsense. And what I find really annoying is when the press released, oh, there's this AI tool that copies itself and hid itself.

### 🎯 セクション 151

It's like, no, it didn't. Some programmer did that. And they did it on purpose to create nonsense they could tell the press to make themselves sound scary or whatever. And so agency is a very hard one thing. We as human beings it takes us what I don't know some of us till we're 16 some 18 some 21 some of us even my age still are not competent adults but I'm working on it.

### 💭 セクション 152

It takes a long time to become a competent individual. And so the doomers basically say this bad thing could happen because magic. So when someone says to me this bad thing could happen because magic. And what I mean by magic they can't give a mechanism. I say, but look, can we rather instead think about the problems I see with AI, fake people, fake data, political manipulation, mass hysteria because we're telling things, you know, let's say we, I don't know, generate an AI where there's a nuclear bomb that goes off in whatever country and whatever place it looks really authentic and we put it everywhere at once.

### 📌 セクション 153

That type of stuff is really bad. And I think that the these people are not really acting in good faith. Some of them are super smart. You know, Jeffrey Hinton is saying, "Oh, he's really thought that that, you know, the thing was alive." He's either really stupid or needs to see a psychologist, right? Or he's doing something else.

### ✅ セクション 154

And I I don't say that lightly. And I think that we, you know, thinkers like me, whether you have a Nobel Prize or not, you need to actually have a bit of humility. We don't know what intelligence is. Therefore, to imagine we're going to stumble on it by accident and make Skynet without understanding the mechanism is kind of nonsensical. Equally, you know, why would we we build the initial computer like, you know, the first when Microsoft came out with Windows 3.1?

### 📚 セクション 155

So anyway, I'm diverging a lot, but I think there's a number of things to say. Number one, the doomers don't have a mechanism. They're just making it up. Number two, they're distracting us from where we should be putting our attention, where we have to do regulation and we have to make sure that humans are safe because there's we can't have unregulated AI. We can't have chat GPT being a therapist because it's basic and being a addictionist, right?

### 🔖 セクション 156

It's like if your therapist wants to basically keep you coming to they're going to make you addicted to them, right? It's a kind of psychotic process. They're not making you better, they're making you mentally worse. So there's all sorts of very interesting things we need to solve. And I think that's why I'm against P Doom because actually it's nonsensical.

### 🎨 セクション 157

And also, if you basically fly over the Earth in an airplane, you can see most of the Earth isn't covered by the internet. You'd have to be really damn good to kill humanity. I mean, what are you going to do? Like even if you let off a few nuclear weapons, that's not really going to kill humanity. It's just going to basically annoy some people in a few neighborhoods.

### 🚀 セクション 158

The world is big. You'd have to get every single nuclear weapon to detonate like simultaneously, which is not ever going to happen. Like there is no probability of that. There is no possibility of that. You can calculate a probability, but as soon as a nuke goes off somewhere, everyone else is going to turn off their nukes and go, "What just happened?

### ⚡ セクション 159

Quick, turn it off." So yeah, it's it's irresponsible. >> Okay, I love that. Yeah, thanks for sharing all of that. Um, so before we go, like I want to ask, is there anything else that you'd like to talk about? We definitely want to spend a second just to talk about all your projects and make sure people know.

### 🌟 セクション 160

I'm also curious if there uh a couple of people you mentioned like Susan, Stephanie, or other people you maybe think we should interview and if you have a favorite Rick and Morty episode. Go ahead. >> My favorite Rick and I don't know. Um, >> Pickle Rick probably cuz now you're building Pickle Rick is the boring one, but yeah, Pickle Rick is pretty is pretty fascinating. I I like the I mean they're all a bit weird, right?

### 🎬 セクション 161

I think every episode of Rick and Morty is a is a so many different science fiction projects you could do. Um, but um that I couldn't possibly name one. I just love them all. They're pretty amazing. The the the uh the swearing makes me look good because I swear a lot but not as not as so much as Rick and Boy >> cuz you're not burping between [laughter] No.

### 📋 セクション 162

>> Yeah, the character is deeply complic deeply complicated as well. I'm deeply simple. Um, no, I mean I think so. One of the things I would say is I'm fascinated by using the understanding the process of computation and applying it to chemistry. So that's one thing we didn't talk about.

### ⭐ セクション 163

So I've built what I call computers where we we we do um we we basically instantiate a touring machine and a chemistry robot to do synthesis. So I actually run a company that does that. So it's kind of my day job. Um the science is kind of the night job. Um and and the other thing I guess I should mention is the team of assembly the assembly theory.

### 📝 セクション 164

I'm working a lot with Sarah Walker at Arizona State University who's helped me a lot develop the theory. We're working together between our groups and also people at Santa Fe Institute to really kind of understand the intersection of complexity theory. We haven't talked a lot about that. I I'm very interested in how assembly theory and complexity theory complement one another. Right?

### 💡 セクション 165

the be I I find it very frustrating that computer science at the beginning was saying that all the universe should be kind of couched in terms of computational complexity and I think that was a misstep but equally I think they play well together because there's this interesting interplay of how do we understand entropy as in material entropy in the universe computational entropy compression and assembly that's work in progress which is really exciting building chemical computers was really exciting and also building kind of chemical brains to see if we can make an artificial consciousness um and and you know that would perhaps kind of think in a different way. And the only other thing I would say is like I would like to kind of you know reinforce the idea that I am very pro AI um used correctly and also I'm very pro getting the labeling right because the concept of AGI and the and and the concept of super intelligence are things I would argue that are not possible right and we we are scaring a lot of people like super intelligence is like saying I'm going to have a super chewing machine or I'm going to have access to magic and all I would say is when People that are listening to this and re maybe watching and thinking about it get sold false kind of arguments about AGI and super intelligence just to think critically about what that means. Of course, I've had robots who are faster than me at chess. We've had them for years. That doesn't make them kind of in a different plane.

### 🔧 セクション 166

It doesn't make them magical. They're just faster at doing chess. And so what I'm what I'd like to do is basically ground things a bit. You know, when Sam Alman says that chat GPT is going to open up infinite riches, this is kind of the thing. The only other thing I'd say is you've got all the PD doomers saying we're all going to die.

### 🎯 セクション 167

And then you got all the kind of prog ones going there's infinite abundance. Both of those stances are [ __ ] They require good human beings to use the tools correctly to have fun to help one another and build a better future. And we will. But we're not going to suddenly magically get infinite abundance because someone's using a Gen AI to basically tell you, "Oh yeah, that looks good. Your fusion will definitely work now.

### 💭 セクション 168

That is the best fusion idea ever. It's going to work." And then you go, "I did it. It didn't work." It's like, "God, do it again. It's really going to work this time." You know, it's like, "Sure." So, we need to get out of the delusion on both sides. And maybe this is what happens when we discover a new industrial revolution.

### 📌 セクション 169

That's maybe why it's so exciting to be alive in this. >> Yeah. It's like the answer is in the middle somewhere. So I stopped being so kind of, you know, like because because I have a lot of friends who use AI and they're like say, "Le, you're just really too anti- AAI." And I'm like, I'm not anti- AAI, I'm anti the people selling it, misselling it to say it's going to solve everything when basically it's just a new tool. >> Does make you wonder like with the printing press where they like, give me all the money, I'll change the way everybody learns and the other people were like, we'll never be able to read again with the printing press.

### ✅ セクション 170

Like shut it down. >> Exactly. Like when people were like writing books they'd say like you know the the the somehow the soul of the authors in the book and when people maybe this is what Jeff Hinton was confused about maybe he doesn't read and when he saw that the there was agency in chat GPT what he saw or Gemini what he actually saw was the incredible agency and creativity of all the people that created that data and it probably is quite or inspiring to have access to a model and interrogate it and get all this you know you literally got access to the entire corpus of human imagination and thinking up until the point the model was trained. That's a pretty mind-blowing thing to have. And maybe it's hard to cope with.

### 📚 セクション 171

And maybe if I'm being charitable and maybe a little bit more open-minded about that stance, maybe that's what he's misreading because it is amazing. Like it's amazing. I can download a model and have it on, you know, Llama Studio or LLM Studio on an airplane with no internet connection. and I can still get it to do competent things with something that's just like 35 GB. It's been trained on several terabytes.

### 🔖 セクション 172

That compression is fantastic and that compression comes at a probabilistic compromise. But within that probabilistic compromise, there are structures we don't yet understand which what which is why AI is fascinating and really interesting to explore, but it's not the answer to consciousness. >> Absol. Absolutely. And so I just want to point out because my pole goal here is to try to kind of highlight different people from diff with different opinions and find commonalities because I feel like sometimes we feel like we're on opposite ends but there's a lot of commonalities here.

### 🎨 セクション 173

So we recently talked to Dr. Roman Impolski who is saying that if we're building narrow systems even if they're super intelligent like they're superhuman at chess like you said or they're superhuman at narrow tasks that's fine that's not dangerous. He's worried about the super uh intelligent general systems. So a lot and and he's saying we can do a lot with these narrow systems. So a lot of what you both of you are saying is very similar.

### 🚀 セクション 174

We're fine. You know the only thing is he he believes we can build generals super intelligence or AI you believe we can't but everything else we're we're very much sort of aligned on. Right. So this idea that we can do a lot with uh AI as tools and it doesn't have to be super intelligent. It doesn't have to be um uh general intelligence.

### ⚡ セクション 175

It can still be a phenomenal tool for research. And so I just kind of wanted to point that out because I think that's important that that there's commonalities there. >> I would agree. And I think this is something really interesting I'd like to comment on. And um so when Einstein came up with relativity, there was a really good prediction he was able to make.

### 🌟 セクション 176

He made the following prediction that when I we put satellites up in space that the atomic clocks would lose time because of frame dragging. So we predicted that ahead of time and we like it's great. Put satellites up. Oh look, the time is different. Awesome.

### 🎬 セクション 177

and relativity is correct. What's kind of happened is that we've invented a technology that processes information before we understand what intelligence is. So, we're seeing frame dragging, right? The equivalent, but we don't know what it is. And what I mean is we're seeing phenomena in our AIS before we have a a really good understanding of intelligence.

### 📋 セクション 178

This is why um the person you just talked about before was saying, "Oh, there could be general intelligence." General intelligence is not possible without integrated kind of abilities to live and die. It's a unique thing to human to living systems that have undergone 4.3 billion years of evolution. Now when we make because I don't believe it's impossible to create a generally intelligent system but I do think it's not going to be possible using conventional technology using silicon. Right? So that's kind of important.

### ⭐ セクション 179

So I'm I but we will get there and that's when we have to be careful. >> That's okay. Very interesting. So you do believe it's possible with some sort of a biological approach >> even way maybe with a a new technology as I said remember the thing I said earlier is like your brain has more potential connections than there are atoms in the universe. when we achieve an infrastructure that can do that, then I'm going to talk to it because it's going to be kind of cool to talk to and you know and and and so I don't I'm not um I'm a materialist.

### 📝 セクション 180

I'm a materialist who doesn't understand what intelligence is yet and like you know Demis and Jeffrey and all these people want to understand it and the open AI guys and the people working in good faith we want to understand intelligence that is because intelligence is the you know there's these I want to understand origin of life right I want to understand consciousness I want to understand um um kind of language if you like and imagination I want understand intelligence so there are four big problems intelligence, consciousness, kind of abstraction and life. And I I'm just starting at the bottom. So for me, I don't even know understand what life is. So people jump to intelligence. I kind of feel like you cheated.

### 💡 セクション 181

We need to do we need to get this bit first. I think and the fact that life is is the gateway to intelligence. I think we should be remissed to jump to intelligence because we can emulate it. And so that's my only beef actually is not that I don't think it can be done. And I just think that we are anthropomorphizing, not using the right controls, not being honest to one another.

### 🔧 セクション 182

And so my job really in this is I'm working on it, doing some stuff. I obviously have vested interest, I have conflicts, but by being o open about my opinions about what is right and wrong, particularly with P Doom and all the other stuff, we might be able to kind of have a really interesting, you know, um, developments in the technology. And I I do think there are, you know, the AI bubble is inevitably going to burst because look, agents don't work. Chat GPT isn't that useful. The day pro hallucination is a problem if you're doing a real job, right?

### 🎯 セクション 183

I've got a chemistry lab where I'm doing robotics. If my AI hallucinates, my lab is on fire. It only has to burn down once, >> right? >> There must be zero chance of the lab burning down. So, we have a lot to do there.

### 💭 セクション 184

So, I I I'm really I'm tremendously excited and I think that we kind of need to kind of calm down a bit. It's hard when there's so much money invested and we're wasting so much money on infrastructure that is not integral to intelligence. Matrix multiplication is not the answer to intelligence. I'm 100% sure of that. >> Understood.

### 📌 セクション 185

Yeah. And certainly there's a lot of money being used up. One final just quick point and maybe we can even cut this out if this doesn't uh connect. Have you heard of a CTO at Google whose name is Blae Aguero Earcus? Oh, okay.

### ✅ セクション 186

You guys have so much overlap it seems right. Uh in your ideas he credit I believe he mentioned you in his interview. Uh any anything interesting there? >> I think Blaze is so blaze works at Google, right? So he has a obviously I think he's a CTO of in technology and society and so on.

### 📚 セクション 187

So he's playing around very playfully trying to figure out what life is. Um and and I think what is you know the ideas is coming out. I agree a lot of them. I think he's doing something. He's asking a lot of interesting questions.

### 🔖 セクション 188

Um and so I have a great deal of um you know empathy for what he's trying to do. So I think his brain [ __ ] stuff is kind of like yeah not really. Um but that's okay. That's his thing. I mean but I haven't got to talk to him about it recently.

### 🎨 セクション 189

But I think um he's asking interesting questions. I think is declaring victory a bit early, but I think he's what he's doing is fascinating. And I think the more people we have working together from different angles overlapping, the more understanding we have on the problem. I think the nice thing is like by me going on the record about what I'm trying to do and what I think and also by reassuring people have very strong very strong views very weakly held. When someone like Bla1 or Sarah or Susan or whoever came and give me more data and I'm like, "Oh, okay.

### 🚀 セクション 190

I'll change the experiment because at the end of the day I'm an experimentalist searching for truth and the truth for me comes out of doing good experiments in the universe theory. So actually what blaze is doing is super complimentary to what Susan is doing and what I'm doing and Sarah's doing. So there's a huge interesting ecosystem and one of the things I really love about bra blazer's approach is very playful very reminiscent of the artificial life community at journal which I like interacting with. There's just this whole ecosystem of crazy robots and things that are going on. It's a there are a beautiful set of people to work with and just play around with and generally ask new questions and using technology.

### ⚡ セクション 191

So yeah, I'm aware of his stuff. He's a super cool guy. He has also done some stuff I think at Santa Fe. He very similar to my friend Michael Lackman who's very very very quiet who did a lot of the stuff that Blaze has rediscovered or independently discovered later. Uh um and so there so they're on the right track and it's really interesting to see smart people converging.

### 🌟 セクション 192

>> Absolutely. This has been such an yeah incredible interview and such an interesting time to be alive. I'm so thankful that we live right now because uh yeah definitely a lot of things happening and we're so thankful for your time and uh just just how you say that you have to have your curiosity bigger than your ego. I've heard you mentioned that one of the podcasts. That's such a beautiful statement.

### 🎬 セクション 193

Like a lot of us kind of get wrapped up in stuff just like we got to be more curious than we're worried. It's okay to be wrong. We got to discover we got to maybe annoy some people. Like you said, it's totally fine as long as it's towards learning and curiosity and all that stuff. So >> I think so.

### 📋 セクション 194

I think that if you're willing to be wrong, eventually you're going to be right. That's what I keep telling myself. Anyway, >> I believe that >> mentality. >> All right. Well, thank you so much for your time.

### ⭐ セクション 195

We appreciate it. That was a great conversation. Thank you so much.
