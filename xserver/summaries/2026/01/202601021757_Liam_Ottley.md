## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

What if I told you that you could build a $35,000 a month AI business with no technical experience, that requires no sales team, has no marketing requirements, and runs at an 80% profit margin. Well, if that sounds too good to be true, then this video is going to blow your mind because today we have Lionus, who's coming on, who's built one of these exact businesses himself. And he's going to be revealing the unique strategy of partnering with software companies for leads that he has used to build a sustainable and highly profitable business that leaves him with tons and tons of free time to work on other stuff that he's more interested in. This strategy is so unique and so powerful, yet any of you can apply it next year with your agency. And he's going to be breaking down his entire strategy on what the model is, how he found the right companies to work with, the exact offers that he's using to be able to productize and systemize it, and how you can make sure you're positioned to be the number one partner for these companies.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, everything you need to know is going to be packed into this. I hope you guys enjoy, mate. Thanks for coming on the channel. I'm uh super excited to be talking about this because it is a strategy I've been aware about for a while and I've uh we've actually been approached by companies of course as Morningside for this kind of partnering method um but haven't fully moved on it uh just the way that you have. So I think it's a great opportunity for people who are wanting to start an AI business and an agency want to stay away from more the heavy content creation and sales side and just run a lean business uh that's also pretty sustainable as uh you've explained in here.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So thank you for coming on and uh super excited to jump into it. Thank you so much, Liam, for the for the opportunity to be on this podcast today. I think to briefly introduce myself, my name is Lionus and I'm one of the two co-founders of AI Union. We are an AI automation agency based in the Dhak market, meaning we serve Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. And what makes us unique is that we've become the integration partner for several fast growing software solutions in the AI and automation space.

### 📝 詳細説明

What these companies do is they sell integration packages and then we take care of the whole development integration and setup part of it. And this has enabled us to build an incredibly profitable agency. So just to give you a few numbers, we've done over 150 projects in the last four months. We make over €30,000 per month at an 80% profit margin. So going more deeply into our model, what it basically is is the following.

### 💡 実例・デモ

many software platforms, you know, like Vapi, Voice Glow, PhoneU, in our case, they get tons of leads because obviously people see those platforms, people get the ads and they yeah, they they click on the ads, they want to use the product, but they really don't know how to do it. So, they write these software companies just messages, hey, like we need someone to help us get set up with. We need someone who can actually connect our CRM. Looking at that these software companies sometimes yes they do have their own engineering team which takes care of the whole development process and which can help the customers to actually get to their target state to in order to integrate solutions like HubSpot pipe drive whatever but most of the times those small little software companies they don't really want to focus on doing the agency work they want to build a product and that's where we come into play these software companies they simply forward the leads to us. In our case, they even sell integration packages for us and then we take care of the whole development process.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

>> Yeah, it's it's genius really because these companies have VC money. They got a ton of funding in most cases and they're spending a ton of money on ads and to market their their platform and they're already creating the interest and the buyin and finding people who kind of know what they want out of the platform. And they're also your sales team as well. They're like passing it directly to you ready to go and they've already scoped it, I guess, or have a pretty good idea of what scope it is. So, this is a a genius way of leveraging all of the hard work of these software companies who are trying to get the edge and are wanting to have high quality users be built on top of their platform.

### 🎯 応用例

What you have to keep in mind as well is that €30,000 per month, it's nothing for them. Like, they they don't really care if they make that revenue or not. For them, it's all about monthly recurring revenue. And since we actually help those companies increase their monthly recurring revenue, sometimes like they don't even want a referral fee >> because you're building on their platform and you're giving them high quality users, right? You're going through all the hard work of integrating their their business into their platform and those people are going to be long-term users of like a 4,500 maybe even $1,000 a month plan.

### 💭 考察

So, you're definitely providing a ton of value to them and you're also giving them kind of an idea of like super users, you know, people who are fully integrated. what's their behavior, how are they using it, what's the feedback. So, this is a this is a great thing for people to be aware of going into 2026. So, let's jump into it, bro. So, first of all, I want to explain why this model is so powerful for us from an agency point of view.

### 📌 まとめ

First of all, the customer acquisition costs for us are literally zero. Before we actually applied that model, we did the typical things. We did cold outbound. We also have a YouTube channel. But like in all of those cases, our conversion rate was yeah obviously between 10 to 50% I would say.

### ✅ 結論

And obviously this took a whole lot of time and also it took us time to actually build out these channels. It costs money and time to produce good YouTube videos. It takes money and time in order to do good cold outreach. But in our case, we simply get leads, sometimes even leads already closed by the software company. So, as you can see here, you see a screenshot of our income and our expenses.

### 📚 追加情報

In October, we made over €42,000, but we just spent €7,000, which was on the devs since we don't have any salespeople on the team. >> And 100% conversion rate. >> Yes. So, yeah, we we we do have a conversion rate of 100% with some software companies because we don't have salespeople on the team. What happens is that we actually came up with integration offers which the sales people of this software company can sell meaning they sell the integration and afterwards they say hey now go to a union and they will help you with the integration part so we don't have to uh we don't have to convert any customers but instead we already get closed leads >> so that's like the I think as you've got here you've got upsell potential from that right so they come in but then by the time you've completed that build you've built a relationship with them, you understand their business more and you can go from there and sell them like other packages.

### 🔖 補足

I suppose we can get into how you've niched down the agency to keep it so lean, but do you choose to like strictly stay within those integration packages or do you sort of start to offer more custom deb afterwards which can get a little bit messier? Okay guys, very quickly, if you're an aspiring entrepreneur and want to start your own AI business and you haven't already joined my free school community, it's down there in one of the links in the description below. has my full free course on how to start your own AI agency as a complete beginner and you're surrounded by over a quarter million people who are also striving towards the same thing. There's no better place on the planet right now to be surrounded by like-minded people and you get free weekly Q&A with me where you can ask questions directly to me about how to start and scale your business. I'll see you in there.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So yeah, we we do have a huge volume and I mean not every customer is suitable for an upsell, but the more customers you have in your funnel initially obviously the more upsells you can place. It happens quite naturally to be honest because we use nn we use make.com we use zapier in order to build our automations and then the customers obviously start to ask questions hey like what does nn do what does make do what does zapia do is there any more potential which I can use and I'm not sure if you've read money-making models by Alex Hamozi but he talks about so-called acquisition offers so very simple offers which make it very easy for customers to start uh to get to know you. And in our case, the voice agent implementation strictly serves as an acquisition offer. It's a complete no-brainer. And afterwards, we can really dive deep into the processes.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And for example, here after like after we did the voice agent implementation, the customer got curious on like NN. So we did a 40hour workshop on NN where we made over €6,000 net. >> Workshop meaning training for their team or you were just build they you build them for 40 hours? It's a it's a mix. So, first of all, we give them a little bit of training in order to spark their creativity and afterwards we really start to build.

### ⚡ セクション 15

>> Awesome. Love it. >> And last but not least, the huge volume also creates massive potential to find new SAS opportunities. We've now done 150 projects in the past 4 months and obviously we see some patterns. Very often we do integrations for example to build outbound calling solutions and to be honest the way we build them is actually kind of fragile.

### 🌟 セクション 16

We use Google Sheets as a kind of CRM. Then we use NN in order to trigger follow-ups in order to save all of the call recordings into the sheets again. And it's quite messy, but we learned over time what the really important features of these outbound appointment setting agents are. And that's how we came up with our own uh like with our own SAS solution which we call salesfrank.com which is basically all of the logic which we've built on N8N and which we have derived from numerous projects and we've all packaged it basically into this SAS solution and I mean we would never have found out about this topic about this problem if we hadn't done that many projects and if we were not able to validate all of these different ideas and things and so on. Yep.

### 🎬 セクション 17

That's I mean that's exactly what I've said the agency model is even for us at Morningside. It's a research lab for us to find use cases and to build things out like this and we've got one in the pipeline at the moment. It's it's a no-brainer way and then I think to be evidence-based in the SAS opportunities that you shoot for and really being deep in something like voice AI where you start to see these patterns of oh okay the there's an issue with scheduling or if you're sending out too many outbound ones we have these risks and being able to build that into a product uh is really the way to go. So as for as for this, are you using this to deliver your services faster now or are you like setting them up on a recurring? How are you integrating this into your uh into your offer and upselles?

### 📋 セクション 18

>> Yes. So for us it's a completely separate project because I feel like an agency is a great way to make your first dollars but obviously I mean now we've scaled it to 30,000 €40,000 per month but afterwards it gets quite difficult. So that's why now we want to actually position this solution independently from our agency offer and just like promote it using meta ads using our brand and then give customers actually a cheaper access to something like that because now I mean customers pay €2,000 for a Google Sheets and N basically which is obviously I mean you get the point right it's it like the value obviously is there but the UX is terribly awful. So that's why we actually want to give customers a an easy experience. >> Love it.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Uh and just before we move on to how you pick these platforms and the ones that you're working with, uh you've obviously done a lot of projects. What's the typical are these like basic integrations? What's the ticket size on these? Is it ranging from like 500 to,500? How quickly are you able to deliver them?

### 📝 セクション 20

Because 140 projects is a is a lot to get through. So I assume these are probably a bit smaller in scope than people would assume. >> Yes. So we've we've productized it into two offers basically. First of all, we have an we call it the small setup offer which costs €1,000 and there we invest eight hours of our time into the projects.

### 💡 セクション 21

So I think it's very important if you productize something that you put a cap on the hours because otherwise you really run you really have the risk that uh yes like the project might go overboard and during these small setups we just do easy prompting and maybe a kel.com integration for appointment setting. Then for €2,000, people get the API work where we actually use Nadn in order to build easy or more difficult workflows and actually integrate the systems of the company with the voice AI solution. >> Love it. Okay, let's get into how people can find these platforms and and uh the ones that you've chosen to work with. >> So first of all, I think it's very important to find promising software solutions.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So if we look at something like Calendarly for example, in my opinion, it's a tool. It's an easy platform, but there isn't such a huge difference between someone who has used that kind of platform for the first time and an expert. So, it really doesn't make sense to become a partner of Calendarly. If we now look at something like Vapi for instance, I mean here the gap between a between an average user and a pro user is obviously quite big because you can really become an expert on the thing. You learn the ins and outs of the platform.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, this is already much better. But there's one problem to it which is that VAP is obviously way too big. So by now they have their own forward deployed engineering team which can take care of most of the customers. So it really doesn't make sense for them to outsource yeah the the agency work the development to an agency and that's why we work with a different company which is called AI and they are the leaders in the German voice AI market. why they're actually a much better partner than Vapi is that the their team is just 15 people.

### 💭 セクション 24

So if they now started agency work, it would obviously be a huge distraction, but at the same time, you can still become an expert on phono. So that's why a like a platform like Fono is is perfect in order to do something like that and you should actually aim for smaller and more niche players where really focus is more essential to them. >> Love it. And what's the strategy for finding these kind of uh smaller ones? So, I mean, it's might be quite tricky to identify.

### 📌 セクション 25

I guess this was obvious to you. You might have bumped into it cuz it's the in the German speaking market and this is for anyone international trying to find the uh localized equivalent of a lot of these big platforms would be a smart move. Um because there's going to be big markets in whatever whatever country you're in uh that probably don't have many people specializing in it. So, what's the the best strategy you reckon for finding these promising but smaller startups? >> Yes.

### ✅ セクション 26

So obviously you know platforms like Cup terra or G2 and very often there's local equivalents to them and that's also like phonio for instance they are listed on something called OM reviews which is basically the German equivalent to Capterra and G2 and yeah you can find software solutions like these which are really specialized on your local market. Other than that, I think it's just like if you're active in the space, like every now and then you hear from a new company popping up and we didn't search for phono. This just happened to us. I'm just advising it to you now. We actually started from step two on.

### 📚 セクション 27

>> Gotcha. So that's making YouTube videos. Tell us about that. >> So yeah, as I said, I just bumped into phono the solution and I was I was curious. I wanted to show something fresh on my channel.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So that's why I started making YouTube videos about phono and I like I mean I didn't get money from them. I just started to make content because I wanted to show something fresh. But after a while the founder actually booked himself a meeting using myel.com link in the YouTube bio. And we had a like small little chat and he said well I can give you free credits to use the platform and I will also make you an a beta tester. And that's how I started to use the platform even more.

### 🎨 セクション 29

After a while, I also asked him if we could make the placements paid because I mean, we invested quite some time into making these videos, which was obviously a win-win for us because we were able to grow our channel. And if you know Europe, you know that GDPR is a thing. So that's why it was smart for us to make content on something different than BPI because BPI as a US solution um yeah, many European players are quite hesitant to use those. So it was a win-win. But yes, at one point we asked him if we could turn it into a paid placement deal.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And that's how our relationship actually started to get going because we made more videos. We actually talked with him about what kind of content he wants to see on our platform. And after a while, I saw that other software companies actually give out leads for free. I just asked him if he was also happy to give us some leads as well. And obviously he was because I mean at that at that time a team was just 10 people.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So they didn't want to focus on yes actually doing the integrations themselves. So that's why he was super happy to hand out some leads for us as well. And here you can see the message just gave us some intros because at that time he already had a dozen of partners who were actually taking care of the integrations. And I mean after you get a lead from a software company, the task is super simple. You just have to do a great job over and over again.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And that's what we did over time. I mean, with every project, I was very keen on actually making the customers happy. And that's how we differentiated ourselves from the other partners. And that's how in the end we became one of their main partners, receiving more leads than others. >> Yeah.

### 🎬 セクション 33

funny that if you actually like focus on delivering good things the then the relationship will continue to do well. Um it's great to point that out because some people seem to forget that part. But I think there's uh maybe some other things we could sprinkle in here like if there's a community around it like a discord or a they have I don't know like a circle community for a given platform. You can jump in there and start to sort of be active in there. I think that's one great way to get noticed.

### 📋 セクション 34

I've seen people do that before um early on in in my YouTube journey when I made videos on these platforms. You do get reached out to pretty quickly. So, especially this the smaller you go, the quicker they're going to reach out. Cuz if if you're a startup founder with 10 person team and there's no other YouTube content about your platform apart from the stuff that your team is putting out and then someone who seems to be putting in a decent amount of effort and and like thumbnails and planning the videos out, you're going to stick out like a like a sore thumb in in the best way possible. So, I think this is a great strategy just to get on their radar, hop in the community, start making some videos, and before you know it.

### ⭐ セクション 35

I will add a caveat in here, though, and you may have run into this as well, Lionus, but some teams are not the kind of teams you want to work with. And I've had this with some platforms uh over my my years on YouTube where like you either vibe with the team or you don't. And you like the way they're doing it. like the way they approach. They see the value that you provide as a creator and they are willing to like sort of put money on the table or or help you out and make really a a like symbiotic relationship.

### 📝 セクション 36

Um I believe is the is the term. So that's really the uh the thing you should be looking for as well cuz some of these platform owners just really don't get the get the value of what you provide. So you may have to try a few different places until you get the the kind of people you want to work with. >> Exactly. But at the beginning I mean you give them free value.

### 💡 セクション 37

I mean when I started to make those YouTube videos it didn't cost phonu a thing. So I mean yeah I think that's how it works. You give free value over time. That's how you build trust and in the end cool people will appreciate that and say please please take my money make some more videos or here please uh work work with our leads because we know that I mean you make the content so by now you're actually an expert because if you explain something over a long period of time obviously you also start to learn the ins and outs of a platform. I mean, that is a great point.

### 🔧 セクション 38

When if you're just starting out on YouTube and you are small, you're going to need to give give give give before you can start to be picky about who you work with. But just know at a certain point, you do need to understand your value and be able to pick. Are these are the kind of people that I want to invest more time in? As I'm sure you had to make the call, Sonia. Exactly.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, I mean, we got poached by several different voice agent companies as well. And then we also I mean, we asked them, hey, how much how much are you actually willing to give us? how willing are you to work together with us more closely and that's how we did our final decision to work with this company. >> Cool. Okay.

### 💭 セクション 40

What's next? >> So when we started to work with phono I mean we wanted to intensify our relationship and at that point in time you really need to pitch them the value. I mean some value is obvious but there's also I think more intricate details. First of all, even like if the company doesn't make any money on the setups, we actually have a very positive impact on customer retention because we help people to actually make the most out of the platform. Very often, for example, with e-commerce shops, you might have a very simple voice agent which just takes in requests, but with our builds, the voice agent can actually access Shopify, Shopware, whatever.

### 📌 セクション 41

And that this has a very positive impact on retention because we build on top of the platform and obviously that way the switching cost to switch to another platform I mean they are they are inherent right. Second we increase the revenue per customer because the customer can actually yeah get more value out of the solution just as I explained with the e-commerce example. Someone might just yeah have a very basic functionality so that the calls do not get missed. But if the customers spend more time on the call because the voice agent can actually answer more questions, well then obviously the time spent on the call increases and that's also how the revenue of the voice agent platform increases. Third, we give them a revenue share, meaning it's basically free money.

### ✅ セクション 42

Before we like at the beginning we worked together with with Fono on a basis that they simply handed out the leads. Afterwards we intensified the relationship and we actually came up with some offers together and they started selling these offers and we gave them a revenue uh a revenue split and yeah I mean that's that's free money for them, right? We do the work, they get the money. That was you, I guess, offloading more of the sales work to them, saying like, "Hey, if you guys can sell these packages for us and just hand them to us completely ready to go, then we will offer you some revenue." So, it was like, "Hey, you guys help us out a bit. We'll kick some of the money back to you if you're going to take some stuff off our plate." >> Exactly.

### 📚 セクション 43

And I mean, before before we did that, I had to reach out to these leads by myself, which which was obviously a bit of a hassle. Nonetheless, the conversion rate was great. But by actually working together more closely with Fonio, we yeah uh we said obviously it makes sense to incentivize you as well right now and they also asked for it to be honest. >> Great. >> Then we like we also have a very positive impact on the time to value because many customers I mean they think that they know how to configure something like Vapi but in the end they really don't.

### 🔖 セクション 44

And we help these customers to to get started more quickly because otherwise I mean they play around with the solution they don't get to their desired state and then they push it aside because most business owners they are quite busy. So in the end like some customers are really like sitting inside of a solution but not making the most use of it. And we change that because we give people a lift, we help them get set up. So it for the software company they get to experience the value much quicker. And last but not least we give them really qualified feedback because I mean most most consumers they use the software just once but in our case we did 150 projects in the past few months and obviously we get to experience the same annoying things over and over again.

### 🎨 セクション 45

We are power user and many people can actually benefit from the learnings we have made. I think I sometimes believe that we use the software more than the people working at the company because I mean we do the integration work. We do the he heavy lifting and we do complex builds which I mean you just get to experience with real world case studies. >> Love it. And this is such like a lean way of doing this this model.

### 🚀 セクション 46

um just shipping all the sales and marketing off to someone else and then really focusing on just getting those reps in and finding I mean in your case you get to make a ton of money, build a dev team, learn how to run one of these things and get to spot great in this case voice AI opportunities off the back of it and they've got the cash flow and the dev knowhow to be able to build it. Uh I think it's a it's a really really good way people should be really eyeing up next year if they don't necessarily want to do the content side or the like running ads. I mean, you might be able to tell that I'm not the sales guy, the like the hard pusher. So, for me, it was really the perfect way in order to build my agency because I mean, as you see, it's it's a no-brainer offer. And no-brainer offers, they are easy to sell because they provide incredible value.

### ⚡ セクション 47

And that's why I think it's a it's a perfect offer even for for people who really don't want to like step outside do lots of sales have who don't want to deal with all the negativity the negative feedback but here you just have to sit in your cabin basically and build. If you're a business owner who's interested in what generative AI can do for your business you can get in touch with me and my team at Morning J.A.Iai in one of the links in the description below and we can start your entire AI transformation process going all the way from the education and training of your staff to the identification of the best AI use cases for your company all the way through to development and beyond. We have worked with some of the world's biggest sports teams and also publicly traded companies. So rest assured you are in good hands. What would you say is the timeline for someone if they are starting off say they're one of my many people in the audience who have got a bit of a bit of skills in AI automation maybe they've done some stuff on May 2018 they built a voice agent here or there they've been dabbling for them to get to the point where they have uh basically latched on to one of these platforms found a platform latched on to them and started to get their first few leads to really prove themselves whether that's including making a bit of YouTube content to get noticed or just going in the community being very active what's the the sort of timeline you'd say from starting and picking a platform to being able to actually get some leads and be in the in the green making money.

### 🌟 セクション 48

>> So we started to make content about phono in March I believe and then by May we already received our first lead. So it was basically 3 months. >> Would you recommend that they pick a couple platforms and say hey here's three platforms that I'd like to learn to use for one and then to try to build a relationship with. And so you kind of diversify your risk a bit. And so say you're making videos on three different companies.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Um you're learning three different uh different platforms at once. And then you try to make moves on on all those three over that time and hopefully start to get leads within two or three months. >> I mean it depends on how much time you have, right? If you have time to make content on numerous softwares and if you have the time to make multiple YouTube videos a week, obviously that's the best you can do. But if you just if you just have limited time, it makes much more sense to just make videos about one specific solution because that way you position yourself as an expert.

### 📋 セクション 50

You niche down and the software company will love that because obviously I mean if I make content on Vapi on retail, on voice flow, these companies will think hey like he's trying to poach everyone. But if I just make content on BPI, people will know, okay, I want to work with you actually. >> That's good to know. Um, what else you got? >> Yes.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So, let's hop over here on like my strategy on how to become the main partner of a software solution because in my opinion, that's the moment when it got really interesting for us. We've at first been one of many partners. I mean there's tons of people who want to make money with AI and who think that voice AI is such a such an amazing trend to hop on and that's why there were many partners who got leads and somehow you need to differentiate yourself right in in order to get more leads than others in order to scale this actually because you can't run an agency with five leads a month and that's why I've developed this super simple framework in order to integrate more closely with the software company a big learning for us was to product ties. In our case, as I already explained, we have a small setup where we do very simple prompting and then a large setup where we do more complex integrations. And that way, it becomes easier for the software company to actually sell the solution because in many cases, you know, the work, right?

### 📝 セクション 52

Doing or writing a whole lot of quotes is difficult. You really need to know uh what you're going to be quoting, how long it's going to take to do the setup. Yeah, but in our case like basically like a a sales employee can sell it because it's super easy to know hey person needs API integration we just sell this package person doesn't need API integration we sell that package then afterwards we as I said we try to incentivize the software company so we do a revenue split so you can you can give 10% 15% 20 25% to the software company as a kind of kickback or affiliate fee because that way the software company is even more incentivized to give you leads. Third, you really try to optimize the whole process because we do a whole lot of setups. So there's uh quite a lot of repetitive work.

### 💡 セクション 53

So what we did is we basically built an automation where we take the transcripts of Fireflyy's AI and turn them into prompts for the voice agent platform. And that's how we are able to not like as you can see here it includes eight hours of work here and 16 hours of work here and that's how we can actually yeah deliver our setup within the specified time frame. That's just a little optimization you did to get the like essence of the company I guess quickly. Oh no, the Fireflies transcripts from the sales calls like the discussions you had. >> Like we do a first call with the Fireflies uh noteaker inside and then we take all of the text by Fireflies and turn it into the first prompt for the agent.

### 🔧 セクション 54

And obviously by now we've done so many setups that we really know which prompts work for that specific solution. And yeah, we trained our uh Google Gemini model on that. >> Great. It's super smart. >> Yes.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Then afterwards, we tried to improve the collaboration. So we set up a shared CRM system where the software company actually sees the current status of the project. So that way they don't have to ask us, hey, like how's the progress here, how's the progress there, but instead they see everything in their own dashboard. And we also see like who's the like contact person on our end and on their end which really improves the collaboration. And I think it's quite essential here again to do that in order to differentiate yourself from other uh agencies because you really want to show ownership because most agencies I mean they want to make money right but we want to make money while it feels for the software company as if we were part of their team.

### 💭 セクション 56

I think that's the ultimate goal of collaboration. How we achieve that as well is by aligning with the company doing weekly calls where we also talk about the difficult things for for instance who takes care of customer support afterwards or how do we handle these scenarios and I think it's quite important to have regular checkups because that way you are not just collaborators but you become friends over time as well and I mean that's the best factor in order to improve your stickiness kind of and like finally you have to upsell because I mean just doing the doing the voice agents is it's fun right you make a bit of money but the real money comes afterwards and as I already explained before yeah you can really dive deep into n workshop workshops or stuff like that super easily >> yeah it's interesting there there may be a an opportunity for you to even like sell your agent when they look to say if they're growing fast enough and they have the money they'd be able to go hey we want to buy your agency and like take all your systems and process so that we can have our own internal team just like like a Vappy does. So I think that's an interesting thing that you could I don't know if that's come up in conversations but I'd say it has come up in conversations internally for them um that hey look if we wanted to get our implementation partner uh we've got Linus and his team here that we could potentially uh acquire. So I think that sets you up really nicely. >> Yes.

### 📌 セクション 57

Yes. Obviously I mean the founder of the software company he doesn't want to take care of it himself. He doesn't want to be the one running an agency dev team. He wants to grow the company. So yeah, I think it really makes sense to uh to acquire a good partner because you already like he would be like he was he was able to validate the way we work together.

### ✅ セクション 58

>> Cool. Okay. I guess we'll uh we'll keep tabs on that and see what happens. But what else you got for us? >> Now I want to talk about my favorite part about this model, which is that it doesn't need you as a founder.

### 📚 セクション 59

Before we worked together with our software partners, I was really the one doing all of the work because the work was so different all of the time that was really hard for me to outsource it to like to new team members. Uh like for instance, if you have if you build custom N&N workflows, you really need a deep expertise. And I mean I was never a developer, but I started in 2020 building easy workflow automations. So it takes a bit of time to think like a developer and I mean the stuff we do is super repetitive and you don't have to be an incredibly charming salesperson. You don't need to be an expert on NN but the delivery and all of that is super simple in my opinion to build a profitable agency.

### 🔖 セクション 60

You simply need two things. You need customers and you need uh a product and a delivery in order to make these customers happy. And we have all of that. We get the leads from the software company. We have productized our offer.

### 🎨 セクション 61

And now comes the final bit. If you don't want to be the one actually being employed in your company, but you want to be the one who runs the company, you need a standardized delivery. And we have exactly that. So we start off with a like teleform where the customers fill out what they want. Then afterwards, we do a first call where we clarify all of the things being mentioned in the telly.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Afterwards, we do the development. And I've created a very thorough documentation for all of our new employees. So I don't have to teach them how to build an integration, how to use Nadn, how to use phono, but instead they yeah, they just read through the manual. Obviously they are like they are open and I'm I'm very open to answer their questions, but it's also much more fun for them if they really know how their job is going to look like and also like how they do it in the best way possible. And after the whole development uh cycle, we have some feedback, then we go live and then we have a final feedback.

### ⚡ セクション 63

So the process is super standardized. You don't need to have a an amazing gut feeling in order to do that. But instead, we have a team of three working students and two freelancers. It's quite obvious that you don't have to pay €150 an hour in order to employ these people, but for them, they get to like uh they get to deliver value value quite quickly. And at the same time, it's fun and interesting for them because it's a a huge learning opportunity and we can still pay like top of the market salaries for this kind of work.

### 🌟 セクション 64

>> Love it, man. I I think I speak for every general AI agency owner right now that uh we are extremely jealous of of how systemized that is cuz man, that uh the thought of actually being able to step out of the out of the business is is a dream for everyone. And it sounds like you've got to got to that point. And that comes from having a stable lead source that doesn't require you to be pouring uh huge amounts of time into the marketing side. Of course, the sales portion being largely systemized and handled by the other people and also the uh the productized nature of this and of course being able to build the systems off the back of that because you can't build systems if you don't have a a product or a repeatable offer.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So congrats on on this man. This is really awesome to see. >> Yeah, thank you so much. And I mean, yeah, be before we before we discovered that model, before the relationship played out the way it did, I was really, yeah, I mean, I was struggling in some way because I felt like I'm working 24/7, but the whole agency isn't growing because I'm the one who is actually doing all of the work. And since it's been so repetitive, >> it's >> you would have been doing your YouTube content and taking all the sales calls and trying to scope them and then handling the the management of the of the projects as well.

### 📋 セクション 66

Right. >> Yeah. And I mean, every project was different and that's why I always like I mean my like I always had to think about how I will actually approach this project or like all of the different ones. And now all everything is standardized and it's like a like good machine. It just runs.

### ⭐ セクション 67

>> I love it, man. Congrats. Yeah, thank you so much. And I mean running an agency is not it's not the final goal, right? For I think for most of us the agency was the best way to actually enter this incredibly interesting AI market.

### 📝 セクション 68

But doing SAS, I mean you are the you are our role model, right? You've built very like different kinds of SAS solutions because SAS simply scales great. Uh if you look at YC companies, I mean that's that's the way to go, right? So all of that free time, I mean, I I now use it in order to work on new things, in order to advance my personal career. And that's how how we also dived into what I already showed before that we've built our own SAS platform now, which takes care of the whole appointment setting part.

### 💡 セクション 69

And it's everything is it's based on evidence. It's based on our learnings. But I mean, I was dreaming of building a SAS for quite some time, but you know the drill. If you work in an agency or if you take care of client projects all of all day long, it is very difficult to find free headsp space, find creative time in order to work on these valuable things. So now I'm quite relieved that I can actually hand over most of what I'm doing to my team and then really take care of pushing our business to the next level.

### 🔧 セクション 70

>> Less I love it, mate. This is textbook. Um, exactly what I've I've always said this model is about. It's the on-ramp for people to get into it, right? Like really, what regardless of your background, you can learn a bit of AI automation here and there.

### 🎯 セクション 71

You can learn to vibe coding of course is a big uh big channel right now, but applying that through the agency model, getting your reps in, allowing to build a sustainable form of cash flow, having a dev team under you, learning how AI can actually help business and practice uh does set you up for the kind of players that you're going for right now. So, massive congrats on on your execution on this and getting it to this point because this is definitely what a lot of people will be looking up to uh at this point is being able to get the business running like this and having the time to work on stuff they're really uh most interested in. So, really really really appreciate you coming on here today, man. Uh this has been incredibly valuable and something that people should be really eyeing up and considering next year because when you look at the operational differences between this and having to do everything uh such as maybe you're making content, you're taking sales calls, you're scoping the projects. Um any general AI agency owner knows that uh it's not the ideal model, but it is a means to an end in terms of getting your experience, maybe finding the direction you want to niche down, and you've definitely done that.

### 💭 セクション 72

So people could look at this as a as a great way to find that consistent lead source to specialize in a certain area and to be able to build a relationship that allows you to get out of the business and rely on someone else to do the sales and marketing for you. >> Yeah, exactly. I mean, if I think the agency market is quite competitive, running an agency isn't that difficult. And I mean, that's why we all love that model because it it is the model that is very easy to execute. It's very easy to get started with.

### 📌 セクション 73

But at one point when you want to scale, you want to justify high prices. But when the competition is high, you very often have to lower your prices. But in our case, we don't really have a competition because we don't compete with all of the other agencies who really need to turn a profit while having a huge sales team running. We don't have that like high of expenses. Instead, we can run an agency with a very lean team and still turn a huge profit.

### ✅ セクション 74

And I think just to just to finish off, this goes back to what I've been saying for a a very long time, which is like you kind of almost don't need to follow the news and keep up with the latest AI stuff. This the the growth of the technology and how the massive leaps and bounds we've making over the past few years has taken us so far ahead that there's still stuff from 2023 and 2024 AI that like you can apply to millions and millions and millions of business. And what you found here is like voice agents, a few different use cases. While things are running off into the distance and there's all this new stuff happening, you can build a sustainable and profitable business that's just helping everyone else catch up to what we had basically at the start of this year or at the end of last year. >> Yeah, totally true.

### 📚 セクション 75

I mean, we we we don't only have this model with voice AI, we now also started to work with another company in the WhatsApp automation space. Exactly like we use the exact same playbook but as you know WhatsApp automation it's not something which was like discovered in 2025 but it's actually like much more boring but still even with WhatsApp automation you need integration into softwares like Soho Pipe Drive whatever and we yeah we deliver value there as well. >> Love it man. Lionus appreciate you coming on. If you guys want to get in touch with Lionus, check out his agency uh or his social media.

### 🔖 セクション 76

That'll be down in the description. But really appreciate your time today, man. And um all the best for 2026. Not that you need it by the sound of things. And I'm looking forward to if you get Frank up and running, love to have you back on and have a chat about how you built that and how you're scaling up.
