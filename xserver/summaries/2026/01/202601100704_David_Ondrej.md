## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

My name is David Andre and here's how to build anything with anti-gravity. This could be the future of AI coding. Google recently released anti-gravity which is their own competitor to cursor or windsurf. Now what is anti-gravity? Well, it's a full IDE with revolutionary new AI agent features such as the agent manager.

### 📋 背景・概要

Now, this doesn't exist in any other AI tool. And so, in this video, I'll show you how to set up anti-gravity, how it compares to cursor, and how you can build anything with it. So, make sure to watch until the end. Now to install anti-gravity simply go to anti-gravity.google. This will bring you to the anti-gravity landing page where you can see this nice graphic.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

The download is very simple just like installing any other software in the machine. But there is one step which you should pay attention to which is this step right here. How do you want to use the anti-gravity agent and it gives you four different options of the config. Basically each of these options influences how much autonomy and how powerful the AI agents are. Personally I recommend going with the highest one agent driven development.

### 📝 詳細説明

This lets the agents do basically anything. And if you're building something from scratch then it's good. If you're working on an existing project and you need to be more careful, go with the second option. Now, this is what anti-gravity looks like when you first open it. And you can see that's awfully similar to Windsurf.

### 💡 実例・デモ

But more on that later. So, first off, let's open an empty folder. Boom. Anti-gravity. I'm going to create project and let's open it up.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, why does it feel oddly similar to Windsurf? Well, there are two reasons. Number one, both Windinsurf and Anti-gravity are simply forks of VS Code. VS Code is a open-source IDE code editor developed by Microsoft. And because it's open source, you can fork it and build your own version of VS Code.

### 🎯 応用例

But the second reason why anti-gravity feels so much like WinSurf is that it was built by the same people. See, in July of 2025, Google paid $2.4 billion to acquire the top Windsorf developers and founders. Now, it's important to clarify that Google did not acquire the whole company. It didn't acquire Windsorf. simply poached the best talent, which is a very questionable and controversial move that unfortunately we're starting to see more and more.

### 💭 考察

Meta did the same with the scale AI founders. So the first way to use anti-gravity, and this is the basic way, is to use it the same way you would use cursor. Basically, you have the AI on the left, you have the project on the right, you might have it flipped by default, but you know, you can create like a file named spec.md where you describe what you're trying to build. So what I'm going to be building is like a accountability dashboard for the people in my accelerator. And then you would just chat with the AI.

### 📌 まとめ

you know it builds this stuff like that. However, that would be a mistake. This would be using only like 10% of what anti-gravity has to offer because the main feature is actually the agent manager. So the agent manager really is the big new thing inside of anti-gravity. This is what makes anti-gravity different from all the other AI coding tools.

### ✅ 結論

So the agent manager is a new feature that lets you orchestrate and control multiple different AI agents at once in a simple and clear UI. And this unlocks a whole another paradigm of AI coding. literally never even have to look at the code or even the codebase, right? So that's crazy. With cursor, you could like auto accept and not review the code changes, but you still had to, you know, look at the codebase and pay attention to how the project is structured.

### 📚 追加情報

With anti-gravity, you just orchestrate and command different AI agents to do different things, and you can stay completely disconnected from the codebase, from the file structure, and from the actual project, which is really a window into the future. So let's look at how agent manager works. This is like the IDE. This is the editor. And then you click on open agent manager.

### 🔖 補足

And by default, it opens like a smaller window. I think sized like this. I like to make it full screen because you want to be managing many agents, right? But to get back, it's the bottom on the right. So open agent manager and open editor.

### 🎨 セクション 13

This is how you switch between the two. Now here you can choose many different models. And this is surprising, right? You would think that it's only on the Gemini 3, but no, you can use open 5, which right now is my favorite model. And you can simply dispatch the agent.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So I can say read spec. And again, remember this is the file where my idea is described with the text tag and the features what I want to build. So if I'm in the editor, I can see the files. I can see the project folder, the directory, stuff like that. But in the agent manager, I simply see the agents.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So I read spec and implement it like a 10x engineer would. Boom. Plain English, nothing crazy. I just dispatch this agent and it goes right. It's running.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Now I can do another agent. So I'm going to do plus maybe let's switch to Gemini 3. I'm going to say read spec and tell me what is missing. Do not make any changes. Just answer in short.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And I'm running multiple agents in parallel. I can do another one. We can do a completely different model. Maybe Gemini free flash. Describe the core idea in spec in a single concise paragraph.

### 📋 セクション 18

That way you guys can see what I'm actually building. And you can see that these agents are running on the left. And now it made itself full screen. Boom. The core idea is development and accelerator accountability dashboard.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Streamline tracking system designed to monitor progress of the participants. All right. So now we go on the left and we have the inbox. Right. In the inbox you can see all the stuff that happened.

### 📝 セクション 20

So you can literally dispatch 10, 20 different agents, go for a run, go into the gym, go for lunch, come back and inbox will have clear overview what's happening. And when you click on these, you can be brought into the AI agent. So this one is still running because I told it to build it. Now this is interesting. It switches the UI by itself.

### 💡 セクション 21

So I'm not doing anything. I'm completely hands off. Anti-gravity is doing it by itself. So on the left we have the chat with the agent and on the right we see the agent as it does actions. So right now it's running some terminal commands.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It's accepting them by themselves. So it set up the nextJ project by itself. This is already more than cursor would need. Cursor would ask you for accept multiple times. Anti-gravity is just more autonomous.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Now, if you want to see what this looks like, we can go to editor. So, open editor. Our file structure is set up. We have all these things. We have the docs.

### 💭 セクション 24

The spec was moved into the docs. Very nice. Organizing the project for more clarity. And again, you can even work in the editor view. That's so seamless.

### 📌 セクション 25

If you are a professional developer and you want to see the code and the file structure, you can still use it like that and have the AI on the side and work with it. But if you want to be like fully into the future and just managing multiple agents, switch to the agent manager and just only operate in here. Now, reviewing code shouldn't slow you down. But with massive pull requests and long review cycles, it often does. This is where Graphite comes in.

### ✅ セクション 26

It's an AI code review platform that allows you to ship better and review faster. Now, I think Graphite changed the game with their Graphite agent. It's an AI reviewer built right into your PR page. The Graphite agent gives you instant conversational code reviews. You can ask it are there any security breaches and will give you clear answer that's easy to understand within seconds.

### 📚 セクション 27

It can catch logic bugs, security issues, performance problems the moment you open the PR with clear fixed suggestions, you can just one click and apply and it fits perfectly into a faster workflow because graphite enables stacked diffs. So instead of waiting on one huge PR to get reviewed, you can break it down into smaller granular PRs where each change builds on top of the last so that you can keep coding while the other changes are under review. No more context switching, no more waiting. Graphite makes this process effortless with their CLI. It can stack branches, sync with GitHub, and manage dependencies automatically.

### 🔖 セクション 28

For dev teams, this means smaller PRs, faster reviews, and higher quality code without the usual bottlenecks. Try it for free for 30 days at graphite.com. And thank you Graphite for sponsoring this video. Anti-gravity is very flexible. I would say it's like giving an AK-47 to a child.

### 🎨 セクション 29

If you don't know what you're doing, you will shoot yourself in the foot. But if you do know what you're doing, this tool is very, very powerful. Now, as I mentioned earlier, in anti-gravity, you can use more LLMs than you would think. And Google is very generous with this, right? They don't just give you the Gemini models and force you to use their own models.

### 🚀 セクション 30

They offer way more. But the best part is all of these models are free. That's right. When you first install anti-gravity, they have a super generous free plan to steal users away from Curzer, Lovable, Replate, Windsurf, you know, Google just has the money. They have the budget to make the models free and just take the users and that's exactly what they're doing.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Now, pro tip, I would stick to using Opus 4.5. This is, I would say, the best AI model right now. But for front end, Gemini 3 is better, right? So, use Opus for the back end for the architecture of the project. But to design a nice UI, Gemini 3 Pro.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Now, another reason apart from all the revolutionary AI features like agent manager, which by the way is only scratching the surface, there are way more amazing features inside of anti-gravity, which I'm going to touch on later in the video. But apart from that, another reason to start using it is that it's cost effective AI coding. So, anti-gravity provides very generous rate limits for free accounts with even better limits for Gemini pre- users and Ultra users. And this is actually synced with your Google AI account. So, if you're using Gemini web app or like you have, you know, Google AI Ultra like I do, it's synced.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So you'll basically have nearly unlimited limits inside of anti-gravity. And because of the usage cap being so generous, this makes anti-gravity one of the most cost-effective options when it comes to building with AI. Even $20 a month can take you very far. Let's go back to anti-gravity to see what's happening. The agent is still running.

### 📋 セクション 34

Remember, we're using Opus for this one. The UI is kind of annoying. It switches back between the models. So like even when you start a new agent and you you change the model. So like here I can switch it to flash.

### ⭐ セクション 35

This one was running on Opus, right? and it it should switch back to opus but hey you got to realize anti-gravity is like one and a half months old so it's not going to be as polished as cursor but it's quickly getting better all right so it's creating the progress bars all the front end now it closed the right side so it's managing the UI by itself this is because during the onboarding I selected the agent-driven development where basically it has full control over the UI and over the changes it doesn't really ask you for permission unless it's like something critical like using the browser it just does stuff by itself and here you can see what it does without being in the editor So remember, we're still in the agent manager. If you want to go into the editor, obviously you can and you can review the changes in a traditional way. So on the left, same as you would have in cursor, you have the diffs for all the changes and you can do accept all reject all or you can just go completely yolo, be in the agent manager and just manage the agents, right? Kind of act like the CEO of a large tech company with many developers and you say like add this feature, remove that, change the front end and just dispatching agents one by one.

### 📝 セクション 36

So let me show you. I'm going to do what I preach. I'm going to start a new agent with Gemini 3 Pro high. And this is another bonus. You can set the reasoning effort.

### 💡 セクション 37

This isn't, to my knowledge, available anywhere else except for anti-gravity. Being able to set the reasoning effort on Gemini 3 Pro. So, we're going to do high and we'll say go over the entire project and improve the front end design. Do not change any features. Do not change any functionality.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Simply improve the design and the UI UX of the front end like a 10X designer would. Boom. And I dispatched this agent while the previous one is still running. So Opus 4.5 here is building out the main project and we launched Gemini 3 to start polishing the front end and start improving it. And the reason I was so strict with do not change any features and do not change any factuality is that from my experience Gemini 3 Pro doesn't really listen to these commands, right?

### 🎯 セクション 39

So you really need to be strict. You need to repeat yourself. It's like it's very eager. It's very energetic. It'll try to change stuff even when you didn't tell it to change stuff.

### 💭 セクション 40

All right. So this guy is still running. And by the way, notice that while they're running, it's producing what's called these artifacts such as the implementation plan. These are like basically internal documentation so you can see like what's happening. So it basically created a whole documentation like a almost like a readme file for the plan of how to implement this and then it's following that plan like a professional developer would.

### 📌 セクション 41

And at the end when it's finished it gives you this the walkthrough. So this is another artifact. You can make that full screen and this is a walkthrough of everything that it did. So what was built basically a report project structure and the setup required. Like you could literally send this to a client and it seems like you just spend many hours building something and then giving them a clear document that overviews what was built but it was all done by anti-gravity.

### ✅ セクション 42

All right, let's look at what the next steps are. We need to create a superbase project and then create the tables I guess. All right, let's do that. So inside of Superbase, we can start with the free plan. It's very generous anti-gravity testing doesn't matter.

### 📚 セクション 43

Just do some random database password. I mean, if you were to do it as a serious project, obviously save it. But right now, we're just testing. So, we switch to editor mode. Kind of annoying.

### 🔖 セクション 44

All right. So, here's the setup setup required. It's run schema in the SQL editor. So, we need to open this file. Actually, we need to probably accept all these changes.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Accept all. We're going to copy this and just run it in the SQL editor. It's right here. Boom. Boom.

### 🚀 セクション 46

not run it. Obviously, again, if this is your main production app, do not randomly run SQL uh queries without checking them. Okay, this is a new project. We're setting up from scratch. So, it's very low risk.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Let's go. Okay, I ran this. Let me see what's next. Let's go back to ancient manager. You know, why not?

### 🌟 セクション 48

We're going to be using it fully. Close these artifacts. Switch to Opus. Opus is really really good right now. Okay, we need a superbase URL which is based on the project ID.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Give me the full superbase URL. Here is my project ID. Also tell me where create the env.lo file. So this probably one of the few steps you need to do manually is create the env files because um you know you shouldn't expose your environment variables and your secrets to the AI agents. It should be on the root level, right?

### 📋 セクション 50

Uh project local. Yeah. So I'm going to just do new file env.lo. Boom. Copy this.

### ⭐ セクション 51

All right. And then we just need the superbase add-on key which is going to be in the API keys on the left and it's the publishable key. Copy that. Boom. Let me replace this.

### 📝 セクション 52

Save. Now again, do not share API keys with anybody. I'm going to delete them before uploading this video. Treat them as passwords. Okay, let's see.

### 💡 セクション 53

Uh, done. What do I need to do next to run our project? And again, let's switch to open manager. Uh, agent manager. Okay, this is one UI thing.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's not polished, so I lost my prompt. Don't do that. do I need to do to run my project? So again, this should be a simple dashboard for tracking progress for different members in my accelerator. Okay, I did run that already.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So we just do npm rundev, but we're going to tell it to run it for us. You do you run this command and then open the browser to test it. This is because anti-gravity has something called the browser sub agent which can actually open the browser and it can navigate it. It can test your website. This is really the next paradigm of VIP coding.

### 💭 セクション 56

No other app has this right now as like Caster has something like this but it's not as native. So okay, first of all it started a server. You can see no um no. And there it is. It opened by itself.

### 📌 セクション 57

So I didn't need to do anything. I didn't need to accept anything. It just opened by itself because we're in the highest level of autonomy and uh that's during the orboarding but we can probably change that later. Let's see what's happening. Server is running.

### ✅ セクション 58

Let me open the page. Okay. Playback available. So we can see even the playback verify page is work correctly on. Okay.

### 📚 セクション 59

So it even records the testing, right? So obviously here it didn't do anything except for checking that the page loads. But once we create account, we can even tell it like to start testing, right? So we can uh close this for now. Boom.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Then we can do a new agent plus read spec and inspect entire codebase. Ensure everything implemented fully and properly answer in short. All right. So we're going to just double check that it's implemented. And in the meantime, let me show you how you can customize anti-gravity.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So when you go to bottom right, there's anti-gravity settings. It's probably below my webcam. And then you click on that and you go to advanced settings. Here you can customize the agent and you know terminal commands, artifacts, basically how much autonomy, how much power it has. Then with the browser you can customize other stuff as well with the editor as well.

### 🚀 セクション 62

But actually we don't need advanced settings. We need to go to customizations. And here are the rules. This is how you set the system prop. So right now anti-gravity doesn't follow the agents.md convention.

### ⚡ セクション 63

So if you create agents.m MD file, it doesn't follow it which is a shame and I think Google's going to change that. It does follow gemini.md. So if you want you can create a new file name it gemini.md and put your instructions in here and it will follow it. However you can also just create rules here per workspace global or or per workspace right so these are different workflows and you can just type them slash. So this is similar to very what's it called?

### 🌟 セクション 64

Cloud code command. Very similar to cloud code command and uh yeah you just slash you know review slash add feature slashdebug whatever workflows you have you can just copy paste them here from cloud code but the rules are also split into global rules and project rules which is generat. You can see that it detected by itself and you can say keep this project very simple. It should just be a rough MVP now that it knows okay the user doesn't want to overengineer this doesn't want to over complicate this. So this is how you set the custom instructions and it's very important because uh by default anti-gravity is very verbose gives you very long answers.

### 🎬 セクション 65

So that's why I put this as the global instructions but now you know how to change it. Again bottom right click on anti-gravity settings and customizations which opens this tab on the left. Now, when you're using anti-gravity, you'll notice that every now and then it outputs these artifacts. This could be the task list, which is a markdown showing the agents progress. It could be an implementation plan like we saw earlier, which by the way, sometimes is like very visual with these graphs.

### 📋 セクション 66

But regardless of what format it is, whether it's just the road text in markdown, whether it's graph or a screenshot or even the recording, you can actually comment directly on the docs to give it feedback or to correct the agent before proceeding further. For example, if we go to the agent manager again and if we go to the previous one, the one that actually implemented the code, we can see that walkthrough is an artifact, right? It open on the right, we had the tasks, there's a task, boom, it's another artifact and you can see the icon that you can comment on each line, right? So, you can give it feedback like this implementation plan as well as artifact and you can just do your comments and then say implement everything and it will see the comments. It's just a better way of prompting it.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Let's go back to this one which should be Gemini. And again, I really don't like how it doesn't remember which agent was which model. Let's see. Okay, so if we load it ourselves now, the issue with um okay, what is this? This is U.

### 📝 セクション 68

You need to add some contrast to the login page otherwise the user cannot see where text is and where background is. I was about to say that you shouldn't delegate all of the testing. Even though there's the browser sub agent and it can use the browser, it can click, it can test the buttons, it can even fill out different fields, you need to be using the app yourself, okay? Otherwise, you have no idea what happened because we're already delegating the coding part. That's already established in, you know, 2025 that coding agents, plot code, codeex, cursor are amazing at coding and you can just give them all the coding and they can build app.

### 💡 セクション 69

But now with anti-gravity, you can even delegate the testing, the actual usage of the app, which is very dangerous because if you have zero touch point with the app, you'll have no idea what it feels like, what what it looks like, nothing. So I would be very hesitant to delegate the testing. And the browser sub agent is still in its early days. It's pretty buggy. So if you want to use anti-gravity, I would focus really on the agent manager and how easy it is to run multiple agents in parallel where each one does something different.

### 🔧 セクション 70

It's like reload this. All right. It's updated the login page, but it's it's not really updated. npm rundev. Oh, there we go.

### 🎯 セクション 71

It's better, but it's it's still a very vibe coded. Let me do super whisper. Boom. But it still feels very vibe coded. Give it a more unique personality.

### 💭 セクション 72

This style is so default. This is so mainstream. It needs to be more unique, more novel. So go over all of the front end again and update it so that it's it has some personality. It has some unique touch.

### 📌 セクション 73

All right. So we can start this agent. And while that agent is running, let me explain what the browser sub agent is because this is another killer feature inside of anti-gravity. So the browser sub agent is a specialized model that controls your browser with clicking, scrolling, typing, reading the DOM, taking screenshots, basically anything that you as a human tester can do. But it only works with Chrome and it needs an extension.

### ✅ セクション 74

Now you know when it's using the browser when there's the blue overlay, right? So if you see this overlay, you know that anti-gravity is testing your app. And the benefit of this is that it works even when you're doing some other stuff. You don't have to keep the tab in focus, right? You can just do other stuff on the web and can keep testing your app by itself.

### 📚 セクション 75

Now when you want to use it, you will see this popup, right? So if we go back to anti-gravity, boom, and if we go to actually in agent manager, open the sidebar. And on the bottom left, you'll see the browser. Click this and this will open Chrome with this right in browser control getting started blah blah blah. This is once you set it up right once you set it up it looks like this but for the first time but if you're doing it for the first time it will look like this.

### 🔖 セクション 76

It'll ask you to install the extension which needs you to log in because again you know Google account anti-gravity limits blah blah blah. But the most important thing is that you need to restart both Chrome and anti-gravity after you install this extension. Otherwise, it will still keep thinking that you don't have it installed. Now, the main benefit of the browser sub agent is that anti-gravity isn't just a developer AI agent. It is also your own QA tester, quality assurance tester.

### 🎨 セクション 77

So, not only can it build the app for you, it can go through it and make sure that there are no bugs. It can test everything, fill out the fields, and really like do the work of another person. So, a lot of people don't realize that this is the step into the future. Now, yes, it's not perfect. You know, it's still in its early days.

### 🚀 セクション 78

It has a bunch of bugs, but this is so obviously the future. It can also take screenshots and take video recordings of the app. So, you can come back later and see what it's actually looks like when the app is being used. And this helps it debug more effectively, right? Because if it only sees code, maybe it misses how the layout is.

### ⚡ セクション 79

But if it can take screenshot, you can see like, oh wow, this text is way too small or these two buttons overlap, something like that. And both the screenshots and recordings will be saved as artifacts so you can watch them later and provide feedback. Now again the browser sub agent isn't perfect but this is like using cursor in its early days. You got to realize anti-gravity is like less than two months old. No none of you were using cursor when it was less than two months old.

### 🌟 セクション 80

So if you want to bet on the future and if you see like the potential of the AI agents also testing the app not just building it right cloud can do that easily but also testing the app and refining it and making sure there are no bugs then get started on anti-gravity it's the best time while it's not perfect while most people are overlooking it now sometimes the browser sub agent doesn't start by itself sometimes you need to tell it like hey browse the you know open the browser and test the app and it also isn't very fast right so with simple changes you're probably better off testing testing yourself, like checking if the button works, stuff like that. And I would still recommend you test your app yourself rather than just delegating everything to Integravity. But it's good to have an AI go through everything and spot bugs before you, the human spend your valuable time doing so. All right, so let's see. Did it finish?

### 🎬 セクション 81

All right, it did finish the revamp. Let's reload. All right, so I guess our UI is more unique. It's still going though. So this agent is still going.

### 📋 セクション 82

Let's see what's happening here. Dev is running. Okay. So, let me switch to Opus here. How do I next test it?

### ⭐ セクション 83

Should I sign up with a real email? And on the left, you can see which AI agents are running. All right. So, I'm going to go here and I'm going to test it. And we should see in superbase a new member come.

### 📝 セクション 84

So, we have zero members now. Let me go in that. Boom. davidjra.com. Send magic link.

### 💡 セクション 85

This be the log magic link. I'm going to go to my email. We're going to have to blur a lot of this. And there we go. We have the superbase off email.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Confirm sign up. Let's click on confirm. And we have an error. Okay. So, let's screenshot this.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Boom. Paste it in. When I clicked on the Superbase email, I got this error. investigate why that is and implement a clean and minimal fix. Again, we can run this while the other agent is improving the UI.

### 💭 セクション 88

Pretty amazing. And yeah, it's obvious that managing multiplayer agents is the future of working with agents. But again, this is not for beginners. Okay, in some ways, anti-gravity is better for beginners because of the automated testing with the browser sub agent. But in some ways, it's more advanced than cursor, right?

### 📌 セクション 89

Because if you take a complete beginner who doesn't even know how to use cloth code and you give him anti-gravity, he's going to not utilize agent manager. He's going to completely get lost and the agents are going to be fighting against each other. He will have no clue how to delegate or when to delegate. But if you take a guy who has, you know, six plus months experience with close code cursor codex and you give him the agent manager, you can do some real damage. You can, you know, you can build super fast.

### ✅ セクション 90

You can execute ideas just like that. And honestly, Codex, OpenAI, Codex was the first one who pioneered this, right, with the web UI back in I think April of 2025 when the Codex web UI was released. So, they were the kind of the ones that invented the parallel execution with multiple agents. But the problem is that Codex wasn't a full IDE. Anti-gravity is a full IDE, which makes it much much better for building apps.

### 📚 セクション 91

All right, so found it. Okay, val. So, we should be solved now. Let's let's go back here. Confirm email.

### 🔖 セクション 92

Okay, make this a wild card. This is a pro tip so that it doesn't just work on off call back. Okay, there we go. I'm going to add this to redirect URLs. Save local 3000.

### 🎨 セクション 93

The app isn't really loading, so I don't know what's happening. Okay, so I'm going to have it debug it. Open the browser and debug the app. It's not loading for me. Let's see how powerful the browser sub agent really is.

### 🚀 セクション 94

There we go. Okay, so it works here. Why does it work on Chrome, but it didn't work in Brave? That's crazy. So, we're testing the app localhost 3000 because we're going to test it in Chrome.

### ⚡ セクション 95

Boom. Send magic link. I still don't like this UI, by the way. I'm going to tell it. I still don't like this uh design style of our front end.

### 🌟 セクション 96

I want you to completely change it once again to something totally different. All right. So, we have the magic link photo login. I'm going to copy this uh copy clean link. Going to post paste it in here.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Uh error denied. Error explation. I don't know. This is crazy. This doesn't work on Brave at all.

### 📋 セクション 98

I'm going to do something different. And can we change our app to not use the magic link and just do email password using superbase authentication? I think this is much better. get into the code and change it completely and then tell me what you need me to do inside of Superbase dashboard. The few lines of code the better.

### ⭐ セクション 99

All right. So, one agent is changing front end, the other one is changing the login because I know this magic link thing. Why not just do like email password, right? Like it's already enabled here by default inside of Superbase. Now, while those agents are running, let me explain the walkthrough artifact because this is one of the main artifacts you'll encounter in anti-gravity.

### 📝 セクション 100

So, walkthrough is basically an autogenerated summary of all the changes the agent did after completing a task. And this is really great for catching up if you weren't following the changes closely like most vibe coders do. And it almost always includes screenshots and recordings of what the agent built. Another thing that people don't realize is that anti-gravity has builtin Nano Banana Pro. And since because both are Google's product, you can use Nanobanana Pro for free inside of anti-gravity.

### 💡 セクション 101

This means that you can generate assets for your app, images, icons, grabs without leaving the IDE. All the graphics, all these assets can be done, you know, logo, banner, whatever you need. All right, so these changes are done. It switched to email password off. I just need to goification providers.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Okay. Let's see. It is turned on. Where can I disable this? Confirm email for faster testing.

### 🎯 セクション 103

Oh, here. Confirm email. Okay. Save changes. Beautiful.

### 💭 セクション 104

Let's go back. The other agent is still running. Oh, it just finished. Swiss international typographic style. Let's see what that looks like.

### 📌 セクション 105

Is that it? I mean, look, it still looks vibe coded. It's kind of crazy. All right, so let's see. David at davidree.com.

### ✅ セクション 106

Okay, let's do let's do sign up first because we need to check our superb basease whether we're even in the authentication. No, we're still not here. members. We We're not even in the members. So, let's sign up for Sketch.

### 📚 セクション 107

Sign up. User already registered. That is crazy. Let's go. Authentication.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Oh, we're here. Okay. I'm going to delete myself because uh I don't have a password. Sign up. Okay.

### 🎨 セクション 109

Amazing. I was using a dummy password. Never. So, we're in a endless rendering loop here. Uh oh.

### 🚀 セクション 110

Boom. Take a screenshot after signing up. Nothing happens. There's some endless redirect loop plus black screen. Investigate why this is.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Implement a clean and minimal fix. While it's doing the fix, let me explain my thesis for the future. There's going to be software that's only built for agents. What I mean by that is apps, APIs, different software that is meant only for AI agents that humans will never see. And anti-gravity is a major step towards that future.

### 🌟 セクション 112

It is agent first. Not only for building, but also for the testing. And as I said, we already are familiar with not looking at the code. But with anti-gravity, you don't even have to look at the code base. You don't even have to look at the files or the structure.

### 🎬 セクション 113

Nothing. Not even have the app. It can test the app by itself. So this unlocks the possibility of having one agent build custom software that other agents from other companies, other people can use that you never look at and the owners of the other agents never look at. It's basically software from agent to agent.

### 📋 セクション 114

And this is just the first stage. It's going to get much crazier much faster. So if you see the vision, consider yourself one of the early people and take it seriously and start using these agents. That's that's the only way. Being on the cutting edge is really getting your hands dirty and using the cutting edge tools and come out.

### ⭐ セクション 115

Even if you don't adopt that tool, you should give it a few hours and really try to implement it into your own works workplace. So if you are using cursor, if you are using wind surf, just start using anti-gravity because it's created for AI agents especially the agent manager is completely different way of working with it. It's not like you sit there in the ID with the AI on the side taking up 50 to 40 to 50% of the screen. in the agent manager, it takes up all of the screen, right? Like if we just go here, boom.

### 📝 セクション 116

It's like we don't see any files, any code. We just see AI agents. So yeah, this really is and it's probably going to be easier for Windsor users to switch because it's built by the Windsor people than Curs users, but still um it's very like I would highly encourage you to try spend few hours in the Asian manager and not even look at the editor. Okay, so it says the issue was fixed. Let's reload that.

### 💡 セクション 117

Um, okay. I can also give it my login and have it test it myself. So, say test it yourself. Here is my login. Open the browser and try logging in yourself and debug this until it works.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Keep working until our app works. Now, with anti-gravity, you got to be careful about ecosystem login because Google has a lot of services, right? Most of us are using Google calendar, Gmail, Google Workspace and with anti-gravity, it's just another step where Google would own and see all of your code and you even like your IDE would also be owned by Google. So there is a currently a big movement to de Google yourself so that when Google is down your whole life isn't in shambles or that when you know the government would ask Google they would have all the data about you. So just be careful about this.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Okay, that's my warning. Uh, again, I think you should test anti-gravity, but be like if you are mindful about privacy and security, you probably shouldn't use all your software from a single company. So, with that being said, this is the video on entire gravity. My conclusion is that it is very powerful. It's still in its early days, again, less than two months old.

### 💭 セクション 120

So, if you want more production ready, I would probably go with cursor. If you want to experiment more and you don't mind the occasional bugs and rough edges, I would go with anti-gravity. Either way, all of you should spend two or three hours using the agent manager in anti-gravity because it's completely different paradigm of working with a agents and see if you like it. See, you know, how it works, what you don't like about it. But uh yeah, I have a feeling that anti-gravity is going to be a real strong player in the AIuning space.

### 📌 セクション 121

And I think this is not going to be the last video on anti-gravity. So, if you want YouTube to recommend you more content on AI coding, make sure to subscribe. And if you are serious about AI and you want to start a real AI business in 2026 to actually profit from the AI revolution, I made a full video about that. Go watch it here.
