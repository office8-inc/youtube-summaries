## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, Kimik K 2.5 just released and it's incredible. This is the Deep Seek moment all over again. And not only is Kim K 2.5 the best open-source model in the world, it might be the best model in the world, period. Because it even beats Opus 4.5 on many different benchmarks. So, in this video, I'll show you what makes K2.5 different.

### 📋 背景・概要

I'll explain the built-in agents one feature, and I'll show you how you can build anything with Kimmy K2.5. So, make sure to watch until the end. Now, if you're new to AI, you might be thinking, where does Kimmy even come from? Well, Kim K2.5 was made by Moonshot AI, which is a Chinese AI research lab. So, something like OpenAI or Enthropic, but from China.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Moonshot AI was founded by Yangzillin. And he used to work at Google Brain. He got his PhD for Carnegie Melon and he even co-authored several of the key transformer papers. Also, Mushet AI is backed by some heavy players such as Alibaba and TSent, the biggest Chinese companies. They raised over $2 billion to build Musher AI and currently they're valued at over four billion, but I have a feeling that number is going to double very soon.

### 📝 詳細説明

Okay, but why is Kimmy K2.5 so damn good? Well, first off, the previous model Kim K2 was text only while K2.5 is natively multimodal, which means it supports images, videos, audio, documents, different modalities, not just text. But here's where it gets better. K2.5 can also spawn and coordinate up to 100 different sub aents in parallel and it does it by itself but more on that later. And it can do all of that while being eight times cheaper than Opus 4.5 from Entropic at a similar performance.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Some benchmarks even better. So here's the plan for this video. First, I'll explain why Kimmy K2.5 is such a breakthrough and how you can benefit from it. Second, I'll show you how to use the kimmy.com web app with the new agent swarm feature. And third, we'll set up Kimmy code, which is their own competitor to cloth code, and use K2.5 inside of Kim Code to build anything you can imagine.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, if you really want to be on the cutting edge of AI, block out the next 15 minutes and pay full attention. Now, first off, we need to address the Claude controversy because sometimes when you tell Kimmy K2.5, tell me about yourself, it starts off by saying, I'm Claude, an AI assistant from Enthropic, which is concerning to say the least. So, what's actually going on? How come Kimmy K2.5 sometime responds if if it was Claude? Well, we there's two main options.

### 🎯 応用例

Option one, which is kind of the safe scenario, the the good answer, which is not as bad, is that Moonshot AI used cloth to generate synthetic data. And some of the training data for Kimik 2.5 was synthetically generated by cloth models. And the reason for this is simple. Opus, Sonet, the cloth family of models are incredible models. Everyone wants to figure out what enthropic is doing.

### 💭 考察

So using the outputs of those models to create synthetic data to train your own model is a very smart strategy but it also might result in a lawsuit from Enthropic. Option two however is much much worse. It is that someone and again this is just speculation could have leaked the weight. So someone who had works at Enthropic or OpenAI might have leaked the weights of the closed source models to China because remember these AI research companies they have a lot of foreign talent right they have a lot of Chinese researchers a lot of Indian researchers and these people on average tend to be more loyal to their country of origin. So all it takes is one person who's of Chinese origin to, you know, be loyal to the CCP working at Anthropic and that could be enough to leak the weights from Enthropic to China.

### 📌 まとめ

Again, we're just speculating here, okay? Don't sue me. This is all just pure fiction. Okay, but the biggest feature of Kim K2.5 is the agent swarm. This completely changed the game.

### ✅ 結論

Kim K 2.5 comes with a built-in feature named agent swarm. This gives it the ability to launch up to 100 different sub aents in parallel, right? So you have the orchestrator and it can launch 50, 70, 100 different sub aents depending on how many it needs for that tasks in parallel. So these agents are working at the same time. It's not like step by step waiting for them.

### 📚 追加情報

And by the way, none of this has to be defined by the you the user. You don't have to worry about the roles, the system promps, how to split these agents. Kim K 2.5 does that by itself. It has been trained on it. It knows how to do it.

### 🔖 補足

And thanks to this agent spawn feature, the complex tasks you give to Kim K 2.5 will be done up to four times faster than usual. So if you give the same task to claw model, enthropic model, gymna model assuming the same tokens per second thanks to the agent swarm, it will be done four times faster. And here's what that looks like under the hood. So on the left you have the orchestrator. This is the main AI agent.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And then he decides to create sub agents. So again, if the task is super simple like answering a question, you know, what is 2 plus2? It'll just answer you. But if the task is like combine research of 50 different companies, financial reports, you know, merge these 10 presentations, some complex task, then the orchestrator will decide to create these sub agents, right? So that could be an AI researcher agent, physics researcher and each of these agents is a separate entity.

### 🚀 セクション 14

This heavily depends on what the task you're doing because the orchestrator will decide the roles for these agents and which tools are available. Then the orchestrator assigns tasks to these different agents, right? So AI researcher gets the first task, second task, third tasks. Then the physics researcher gets the fifth task. Task number 96 goes to the life sciences researcher.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Whichever agent is best suited for that task, the orchestrator will assign it and then the results get reported back to the orchestrator. Now before the final result, there is one more step that involves fact checkers and these check and verify whether the work of these parallel sub aents is correct or not and report the result back to orchestrator. And all of this is happening in parallel. So while AI researcher is working, the physics researcher is working while task one or two is getting done, task 99 is getting done at the same time. And this is the power of parallel sub aents.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And by the way, if you want to use Kim K2.5 for free, it's going to be free for one week inside of Kilo Code. So obviously Kim K2.5 is excellent at many different coding benchmarks. But if you don't want to pay $39 a month for the subscription, you can use this model completely for free for the next week inside of Kilo Code. Now, Kim K2.5 absolutely excels at visual coding and front end. Right now, it's probably even better than Gemini 3, which was by far the best model at front end.

### 🎬 セクション 17

It's what I used for all of my front ends. So since Kim K2.5 is a multimodal model, you can use images as part of your prompts to generate the website you want. Now Moonshot, the company that created Kimmy, describes K2.5 as providing visual agentic intelligence with strong front end capabilities. And look at these front ends. These do not feel vibe good at all.

### 📋 セクション 18

This feels like completely unique, very creative, nothing like any other model would give you. All right, so how do you actually use this model for free inside of Kilo Code? Well, first off, you install the VS Code extension. So let me jump into VS Code. Go to the extensions top right and type in kilo code.

### ⭐ セクション 19

There you go. You see this kilo code AI coding agent. Click on that and click on install. Trust publisher and install. And then once it downloads, all you need to do is sign up for a free account and select Moonshot Kim K2 free in the model picker.

### 📝 セクション 20

So while the extension is installing, just type in kilo code into Google. Click on top right to sign up. Select any of these accounts. It's super easy. Takes 10 seconds.

### 💡 セクション 21

It's going to create your account. Click on get started. And we're already installing this. So we can jump straight to our profile. And by the way, Kilo code is almost always the top app on open router, which means there are tons of developers who are trusting Kilo as their main coding agent.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Now once you install the extension, switching the model is super simple. Go to the bottom left, click here, and select Kimmy K2.5 free. And this is what it should look like in the model picker. Just make sure you select 2.5 and not two. And we can even test it out by sending a simple prompt.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Boom. There we go. And as you can see, Kim K2.5 is responding to us. So again, if you want to use this model for free for the next week, sign up for kilo code and thank you Kilo for sponsoring this video. Now let's look at agents forum in action and we look at real office work that stuff me and you do in our typical week explained by the founder of moonshot AI.

### 💭 セクション 24

All right, so take a listen. from one agent to an agent's ROM. Instead of asking one agent to do everything, K25 creates and coordinates each of agents to >> by the way this is what everybody's trying to figure out. If you look at anti-gravity, if you look at cursor, even cloth code, everyone's trying to figure out how to make multi- aent systems work because year ago that was a fancy concept, right? But in practice it was just not worth it.

### 📌 セクション 25

But I in 2026, this really is the year of multi- aent systems. And I think Kimmy made massive progress on this domain >> working parallel. This specialized agents are essentially copies of K2.5 but with different rows. >> You can see that this is something how it works. Obviously, this is just visualized UI creates these different agents.

### ✅ セクション 26

The names and the profile icons don't matter, okay? Just don't get distracted by that. It's purely to make it easier to understand for people like you and me. But you see that they have different tasks. This one is searching.

### 📚 セクション 27

was analyzing, retrieving, writing. Each agent has different task, different role, different system prompt and they work in parallel based on what the orchestrator says >> and different subtask. Nothing is predefined. The rows and subtasks are created on the fly. >> This is important.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Nothing is predefined. All of this is custom to the task you're doing and the orchestrator agent which is powered by Kim K2.5 decides what's the best for that task. >> By K2.5 running in parallel substantially reduces the time needed for a complex task. for market research spanning 100 companies. >> Again, market research like imagine how long this would be for me and you doing this manually.

### 🎨 セクション 29

No AI. Market research spanning 100 companies. This is multiple days, maybe even two or 3 weeks. Look how fast Kimmy K2.5 can do it with agent swarm. >> It orchestrates a swarm of analysts for turnar around in minutes, not weeks.

### 🚀 セクション 30

For complex translation projects of 300 page, >> 300 page translation guys, you not only do you need to know both languages, but again this is weeks worth of workages. It mobilizes a team of linguist for rapid accurate delivery literature. >> So linguist right notice that it was different sub aents before financial analysts then linguist for transaction tasks. These sub aents are adapted to whatever you're doing to ensure maximum efficiency. synthesis across 50 papers.

### ⚡ セクション 31

It builds 10 senior researchers to conduct parallel analysis and generate a comprehensive survey instantly. Training the agent swarms at scale is technically challenging. We rebuilt our reinforcement learning infrastructure. >> Okay, we're going to touch on that a bit later, but as you can see, the agent swan feature is a real breakthrough and it's very, very powerful if you know how to use it. And of course, I'm going to walk you through that step by step later in the video.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Now let's quickly look at the architecture of Kimmy K2.5. So it's a one trillion parameter model. So pretty big, not massive. You know, we've seen models with 15 plus trillion parameters, but certainly not small, like you're not going to run it on your MacBook. It's a mixture of experts architecture, which means there are different experts for different tasks and only 32 billion parameters are active.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So maybe if there's like a M4 Mac Studio with 512 gigs of RAM, you could run this model on a home machine, which is inspiring. However, the main thing I would say about the architecture is the parallel architecture, parallel agent reinforcement learning. So, this is why the agent swarm is built in. It's not just some, you know, harness that's a prompting trick or, you know, just some loop like Ralph Wigum. This is built in into the model and it gets rewarded for paralyzing first, then for quality.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, this prevents it from falling step by step. Again, 2024, 2025 has been all about step-by-step execution, but that is slow, especially for very large tasks. So this architecture rewards schemic 82.5 for taking the task turning it into parallel tasks and agents and then only focuses on quality. Another interesting thing about architecture is that the vision is built in from day one. So it's not just like you give it a vision tool.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Gimk 2.5 has been trained on 15 trillion tokens that are both text and image together. So the multimodal capabilities are baked in into the model. Now you might be thinking okay David this is an incredible model might be the best model in the world. What is the cost? Well, Kimik K2.5 has a very favorable pricing of $0.6 per million input tokens and $3 per million output tokens.

### 📝 セクション 36

Just for comparison, Opus 4.5 is $5 for a million input tokens and 25 for million output tokens. Meaning, if you took the blended average, Kim K2.5 is 8 to 10 times cheaper than Opus. So, let me get this straight. Not only do we get an open-source model on the same level as Opus, it is also 87% cheaper. So, here's why this matters.

### 💡 セクション 37

If you're still paying premium prices for closed source models in 2026, you're leaving money on the table. You're not being as efficient with your finances as you could be. KK 2.5 literally gives you frontier level performance. It's natively multimodal and it can do 100 agent parallelization. All of that while being open source which again models from open AI like JGBT models from Enthropic like claude are closed source.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Nobody knows what's inside. Nobody knows what type of bias or you know programming or propaganda these companies baked in. Kimmy is open source and it can do all of this at a fraction of the cost. So now let me show you how to actually use Kim K2.5. All right.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So the easiest way to use Kimmy is to go to kimmy.com. So just type it into Google, click the first link, and here we'll need to create an account. And by the way, if you're still doubting whether Kimmy is good or not, look at this. It tops the design arena overall. So this is for like design front and stuff like that.

### 💭 セクション 40

And it beats both Gemini 3 Pro and Opus 4.5 by a pretty hefty margin. So this model isn't just yet another open source model from China. This is a real breakthrough that most people are going to be sleeping on. Anyways, back to kim.com. on the left, click on login and we need to create an account.

### 📌 セクション 41

So you can just continue with Google or use a phone number. All right, there we go. And once you log in, you'll be met with this uh promotion of Kimmy K2.5 showcasing its visual capabilities. Now look, you have a bunch of different use cases, right? So on the left you can select agent which can you know create websites like that.

### ✅ セクション 42

But on the right you have the model selection. You have the K2.5 instant. This is the same as CHB instant for quick answers. You have K2.5 thinking. This is for deep answers when you wanted to put in some effort.

### 📚 セクション 43

But then here's where we get interesting. You have the agent which can do stuff, you know, research slides, website, doc, sheets, and we have the agent swarm. This will do massive research, longriting batch tasks. And this is what we want to test, right? Agent swarm is the top one.

### 🔖 セクション 44

And I think we need to upgrade to do something. I prepared a pretty nice prompt that will test the limits of the agents forum, but let's see if we can do it on the free plan. No, you have to upgrade. So, this is research preview and we need to get one of these plans. So, let's upgrade.

### 🎨 セクション 45

So these are named after like um musical terms, you know, moderat, allegretto, vivace. So I'm going to go with algretto and set up the $39 a month plan now. All right. And there we go. I've been upgraded.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So if I go to the left, we should see the Algretto plan. And now I should have the agent swarm enabled and I have 33 left. And this uses free at a time because it's very computer heavy. So let me paste in my prompt and let's start it. So let me read it out.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Compare the last 18 months of funding, key hires, open source releases and benchmark progress of moonshot AI, Deep Seek, XAI, Enthropic, OpenAI, and Meta AI, right? So just some AI companies produce a detailed 2025 2026 landscape report with sources. Combine everything into single compressor report. And look at this, it's already assigning the sub aents. This is beautiful.

### 🌟 セクション 48

So first Rosalind AI company researcher assigning task generic parallel tasks. The UI is very nice here. They really cooked. Kim really cooked with the UI. Okay, we have look at this.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Leewa, Joker, Quentin, Loveville. Each of these have different We have six parallel sub aents right now. Woo, Research Meta. So each of them focuses on different company, right? You can see that uh this one is on Moonshot, this one's Deep Seek, this one's XAI.

### 📋 セクション 50

And we can see the work of each of the agents at the bottom. Can easily switch between them and see what each of them is doing and the progress. And again, this task, just think about how long it would take you to do this manually without AI. So we can see again what each of the agents is doing. Boom.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Searches. Bunch of searches. This one's reasoning. Okay. Acquiring standby processing.

### 📝 セクション 52

So some of them are English sources, some of them are Chinese sources. So it's already doing 25 searches. We can minimize this window if we want to see the normal chat or we can maximize it to see the agents in progress. And as it says on the on the bottom left, this task is handled by agent swarm. Follow-ups will continue with K2.5 agent.

### 💡 セクション 53

So it will switch to the agent for follow-ups, but the agent because the agent's form is very computer heavy, right? This a this is very likely that Kimmy is losing money on this. So I would only recommend you use the agents form for really detailed tasks like this. I think this is a brilliant example of what it's powerful because this give it to GPT or be lazy. It'll check a couple of sources and it'll give you a report that's not really detailed.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's not really cross referenced. It won't be properly fact checked. Again, you can improve with deep research, but then it wouldn't produce like creatives. It wouldn't produce the the landscape report. So, this really is best for an agent war.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And we'll see how good this is when Kimmy finishes running. Okay, so some of these agents seem to be finished. Look at this Rosalind. We have the answer from the sub agent. Then we have Lee Hua.

### 💭 セクション 56

So we're still waiting for these last two and then once everything is together the orchestrator will synthesize everything into one. Now in the meantime let's set up ki code cli which is like clo code comparator but from ki. So first step is to run this curl command in your terminal. So just open the global terminal on your computer and paste it in and hit enter. So you can see it's installing the necessary packages for kim code.

### 📌 セクション 57

There we go. And now we can type in kim/- version to check if we have it installed. Version 1.3. Beautiful. Next up, open an IDE.

### ✅ セクション 58

VS Code cursor. Doesn't matter. Just NA code editor. Open project. And let's create an empty folder named project.

### 📚 セクション 59

Boom. Create. There we go. As you can see, there's no files in here. I'm going to close all these sidebars.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Let's open a terminal and type in kimmy. There we go. Welcome to Kimode CLI. Send help for more information. Model not set up.

### 🎨 セクション 61

We need to do / login. So do /lo redirect us to the website to authenticate with the subscription I just purchased. Login successful. Okay. And you can see the in the website you can see your weekly balance, your limits and your plan.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So you have 7,000 I think messages and then the limits are per hour so you don't spam it too much. But here we say hey let's see if it works. There we go. Model. Let's make sure we're using Kimmy K2.5.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Enter. Enable thinking mode on. And we are using K2.5. Amazing. So, I'm going to move this.

### 🌟 セクション 64

As you can see, the it's not as smooth as cloud core open code, but it works. And we're going to test it right now to see what it's made of, whether kill me code is competitive with cloud core open code or whether it's just a gimmick. And I'm going to give my unbiased opinion because I've spent hundreds of hours in cloud code. If I if I combine my usage of cloud code, cursor, all these tools, it's well over a thousand hours. So I know what I'm talking about here.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Anyways, let's check whether our report is done. All six completed. Let me synthesize everything into a comprehensive landscape report. And this is a synthesizer report synthesizer sub agent. And again, this can do up to 100, but now it did six here and seventh.

### 📋 セクション 66

So it doesn't need to do all 100. again depending on the task. So we'll see how fast Bergson is running. It's kind of funny because I'm in Norway now. That could literally be like a Norwegian name.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Anyways, we need to select some build idea to test Kim code on. Right. So what I prepared is these two images. And by the way, I have to give credit to this tweet I saw from 0x0ero of this front end. Like this is incredible.

### 📝 セクション 68

I'm going to show you this. Kim K 2.5 made this, right? And this is imagine the typical vibe coded website that you see where you instantly know, okay, this is made by AI. You would never guess this was made by AI. Like Kim K2.5 is insane at front end.

### 💡 セクション 69

And I'm going to try to replicate this website because he claims that it was done in one shot, right? And this is this is just wild. So yeah, let's let's see. We have the two assets here, the two images, Ash's relativity and born of Union 1956. We're going to try to re recreate.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Let's rename this to Kim code so it's clear. Kimi code. Boom. We're going to use Kim code to recreate this. So I'm going to use the same prompt.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Boom. To have added I'm going to tag in the files a relativity and bond of as you can see the UI is not as clean as closed code and open code. But listen as they say don't judge a book by its cover. You know, maybe Kim code is really locked in and just like the terminal UI isn't as polished. You know, it's very possible.

### 💭 セクション 72

We'll see. Okay, we have some reasoning. I'll build you an immersive Asure inspired techno website. Let me first explore your images and links to understand your aesthetic. So, let me read the prompt, right?

### 📌 セクション 73

I want you to build me a fully interactive website with this cosmic techno design. It should be an intro about me, who I am. Need to be okay. So, again, this is from that guy. Major shout out to this Twitter account.

### ✅ セクション 74

But I want to see if this can replicate in a single prompt because that's crazy, right? So here's more about the warm design style and how it should look like, how it should feel and Kimmy is going. It's reasoning. It's pretty fast actually. If you look at open router.

### 📚 セクション 75

So yesterday I was complaining that uh there aren't enough providers because there was only moonshot AI, right? Only the creators of Kimmy on open router. So I tagged a bunch of these other companies and today there's four other ones. Now obviously probably wasn't influenced by my tweet. But hey, I'm willing to take the credit for this.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Just kidding. If you're not following me on Twitter, by the way, make sure to do that. Otherwise, you're going to fall behind. You know what it's doing? Link below the video.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Okay, back to here. Let's see if it's doing something using write file. It did a bunch of reasoning. It's read these files. So, okay, read media file.

### 🚀 セクション 78

That's the tool of analyzing images. And then fetch URL is for analyzing websites. Now, it's using write file to create the index HTML. And let's see if it can actually do this in a single prompt like that guy claims because if so, that's pretty crazy. I mean, even if it takes few prompts like that, that website just looks amazing, you know?

### ⚡ セクション 79

It's wild. Anyways, let's look at this. Do we have it? Okay, we have it. How long it took?

### 🌟 セクション 80

Do we have the length of this task? I think it was like 8 n minutes. So, we have the key findings. And here's our landscape report. It's in markdown.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Can actually download it. SK report preview file. Let's download that as markdown. Maybe I just copy the contents of it. It's probably simpler.

### 📋 セクション 82

Let's go back to cursor. Let's create new file. Report.md. Paste it in. Okay, this needs to be cleaned up which we can I guess dispatch a quick open code agent which by the way you can use Kim K2.5 in open code as well because I have open router setup.

### ⭐ セクション 83

So then you do SL models and then you just select Kim K2.5 through open router inside of open code. So if you're not like if you don't like Kim code if you think it's like bare bones or too slow okay it wants an approval I'm going to approve it. If for any reason you don't like Kim codes then open code is obviously much more polished and it can use Kimik 2.5 pretty easily not just through the one provider right because keep in mind Kim K2 I mean not Kim Kim code is using the subscription right keep in mind this is what we used so all of that data is going straight to moonshot AI which again it's Chinese company if you don't if you don't like that then you can use different providers that's the beauty of open source this model is open source so anybody who knows how to run inference on it and who has the sufficient compute can run inference so we see Fireworks, GMI cloud, uh, Novita providing inference as well. And you can use these and in fact these are much faster. Look at this.

### 📝 セクション 84

Fireworks 140ps. GMI cloud 75TPS. So I would actually recommend you use open code with open router and load that quick to there because it's going to be using the fastest provider and your data will not be sent to China. So here we can say read report.md and clean it up. So it's clear markdown.

### 💡 セクション 85

Do not change any info or text. Just fix the broken markdown styling. We're going to run it on this task. Okay, it's again string replace. So many different approvals.

### 🔧 セクション 86

It's kind of annoying. Anyways, let's look at this one. This is the report. All right, so this is already clean. So maybe we can kill this task.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Whatever. Can review running? Let's see. 400 line report would have taken me or you days. Comparative analysis of moonshot AI deepci x okay meta executive summary.

### 💭 セクション 88

The artificial intellig industry has entered face of unprecedented consolidation and competition with six major players defining technology frontier. It's missing Google but okay. This report analyzes I mean that was probably fall with my prompt now that I think about it. I don't think I mentioned Google. Anyways, report analysis strategic positioning, financial banking, talent movements, open source contributions, and benchmark performance.

### 📌 セクション 89

Key findings: funding dominance by US incumbents. Well, obviously OpenAI Exodus creates industrywide ripple effects. Yeah, basically everybody left from OpenAI. China's efficiency revolution. Deep Seek started it.

### ✅ セクション 90

By the way, what happened to Deepseek? Kimmy overtook Deepseek. Literally, at this time last year, Deepseek R1 was the thing. Everyone was talking about it. What happened?

### 📚 セクション 91

Where is Deepseek R2? Kim overtook Deepseek as the leading Chinese research lab and they're cooking. So I don't know what happened to Deepseek. Open source strategic weapon Meta. Okay, Meta is completed trolling as well.

### 🔖 セクション 92

I I've never heard of Llama since the release of Llama 4, which is a huge flop. But yeah, interesting. Here we have the talent exodus, talent movements, funding, Chinese companies, open source strategies, open versus closed implications, benchmark leadership. Okay, some of these are outdated. This is not good, including such old models.

### 🎨 セクション 93

I mean, look, the report is very thorough, but I noticed some issues, some outdated data. So, yeah. Is it perfect? No. Is it impressive?

### 🚀 セクション 94

400 lines in 8 minutes? Yes. And again, if you're using this for your job, make sure to actually uh don't trust on it fully, you know, double check it, basically. All right. So, are we done?

### ⚡ セクション 95

We are done. That took like 5 minutes. Let's see what happened. The website is done. And uh all we just need to do is open the index html in our browser.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Okay, it's all everything is single HTML. Oh, wow. Okay. 1,500 lines. Crazy.

### 🎬 セクション 97

So, let me try to open this up. Open with Brave browser. Let's see. Okay, so it's not as impressive as the tweet. Still looks nice.

### 📋 セクション 98

Like you would not think this is vibe coded, you know? That's what you have to realize. Look at these animations. Very clean. Assense trajectory cross check connect.

### ⭐ セクション 99

Yeah. So, okay, wait at angle. Is that some cool design? I mean, listen, it's it's a nice website and it's a single prompt, but it wasn't able to replicate quite the power of the suite. So again, if you want to build something serious, send more than one prompt.

### 📝 セクション 100

But yeah, Kim K2 is a huge step in the in all directions. And keep in mind, this is open source and it's 8 to 10 times cheaper than Opus. So it's not even fair comparing this to Opus because that would cost you like 10x more and it's not open source model. So like Kim 2.5 is incredible. And by the way, if you want to see my video on Open Code, which I made recently, which dives deeper into how to use this super powerful tool, watch that here.

### 💡 セクション 101

here. It's going to be somewhere on the screen. Open Code is one of the main coding tools you have to learn for 2026.
