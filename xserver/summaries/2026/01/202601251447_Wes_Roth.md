## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I've been meaning to make a predictions video since right around New Year's, but there was a lot of news coming out and I kept just pushing it back. Today's a slow news day, so let's quickly run through some of my predictions. I think it really helps to kind of get it on record on a video so I can go back and see where I'm wrong, where I'm right, and just kind of adjust my lens. But let me know what you think. Do you agree with these or do you think they're completely off?

### 📋 背景・概要

One important thing, this is for both 2026 and 2027. So, a lot of these predictions do have that 2-year timeline. First prediction is space is the next big thing. Putting our AI data centers in space does make a lot of sense. Google did a lot of the research showing it's very feasible.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Now I don't think it's going to start happening in the next 2 years. I think the timeline is more like 2035 or thereabouts. But I think we're going to be seeing a lot more activity in that region, more startups, more investments, more trial runs, etc. Google is planning a two satellite run in 2026, I believe. So they're going to launch two satellites up there.

### 📝 詳細説明

They're going to have TPUs on board. They're going to have solar panels to get the energy from the sun. And they're going to talk to each other through space lasers. So, keep an eye out for that. Next, I think we're going to see something big in terms of crypto plus AI plus religion.

### 💡 実例・デモ

We've already seen something similar with the terminal of truths, right? So, it had an agent on Twitter. It was kind of a quasi religious theme to it. And then they spun up a a cryptocoin and actually did pretty well in the crypto markets. My prediction is that was just the beginning.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

In the next two years, we're going to see something that's much much bigger. So, it's going to have an AI component like some sort of AI model, AI agent. It's going to have a crypto component, something that is a financial in nature, something that's going to allow this agent to actually have some financial power and ability to accumulate wealth. And it's going to have some sort of a religious component to it. And I don't necessarily mean like one of the currently known religions.

### 🎯 応用例

It might be something new. It's going to have some whatever the word is, a spiritual, occult, religious component to it. cultlike perhaps some people might say. So the terminal of truth this coin I believe the market cap got into hundreds of millions. So I expect this next iteration would be much bigger than that.

### 💭 考察

Next prediction is that Grock will do something kind of crazy and something unexpected either in like the financial markets or some scientific discovery or something like that. We're already beginning to see some telltale signs that Grock for example latest to Grock 4.0 O it already created some mathematical approach that is that is very unique that people are very surprised about. We covered a few videos ago a professor out of UCI was saying that it was able to come up kind of a new formulation that humans have struggled with. So we already seeing it doing kind of automated theorem and discovery. We've seen some pretty incredible things with it in the financial markets.

### 📌 まとめ

So something about how Grock is being trained seemingly it has these sort of jagged edges that tend to impress in certain specific areas. So I do expect we're going to see something huge in one of those areas either theorem discovery some sort of a new scientific discovery financial markets it's going to be math related or at least kind of the underlying substrate will be math like right if you're if you're trading stocks you're kind of looking at the math the statistical analysis stuff like that technical analysis for trading something like that. So my prediction is one of the new Gro models 4.20 or five will have some pretty mind-blowing headlines within the next probably within the next year honestly. Next I think we're going to start seeing video games developed by AI. We've already seen sort of small simple games developed by AI.

### ✅ 結論

We're going to see more like maybe not AAA but we're going to see full-blown games that have millions of users that have followings. We're going to see them starting to roll off and they're going to be designed, you know, mostly by AI, 99% AI, maybe even 100% end to end made by AI. Perhaps we'll even see that coming out of XAI. They did promise that they're going to have a video game designed by AI or an AI assisted video game rolling out sometime in 2026. Next, I think benchmarks are going to get a lot more AI agent focused.

### 📚 追加情報

So instead of acing some quiz or just strictly answering some questions like most of the benchmarks that's how they're made currently. We're going to see a lot more outcome oriented across longer horizons. We are already beginning to see more of that like which one of the AI models can invest over let's say an 8week period which one can trade stocks better which one can run a vending machine better. I I think we're going to see a lot more of that. Next, I think we're going to see a lot more verification as a service kind of companies and services spring up as AI content and AI agents become more and more indistinguishable for from real humans from reality.

### 🔖 補足

I think there's a whole new industry that's going to evolve that's going to play a role in this verification. As an addition to that, I think you know real human or or humanmade some label like that will become similar to what we have with like non GMO or organic labels that will give it an air of something being more premium more pure. Right? So if you're producing a music, if you can verify that it was produced by by you that no AI was involved, then you might have a humanmade label on it and maybe there'll even be specific sort of places on the internet where they curate that humanmade music only. It'll become sort of a luxury certification.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So the rise of verification as a service, certain brands, certain labels that people are going to like specifically about how authentic human something is. And some people will also put more of a luxury sort of a weight on that. That's happening in the next 2 years for sure. We'll also start seeing the very beginnings of robotic slop specifically in the households. I think in the next 2 years we're going to start seeing humanoid robots or not necessarily humanoid but like multitasking ones.

### 🚀 セクション 14

I'm not talking about like a a Roomba or or something that can wash your dishes. Something that can like move around and do a whole bunch of stuff. Probably humanoid. Although a lot of people are having a lot of success with having it be on wheels and having multiple hands. So maybe it'll take a like a semihumanoid form factor.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Whatever the case, we're going to see a lot more robotic slop. What do I mean by robotic slop? Well, if you think about it, there's a lot of tasks that are very, very difficult. Cooking a gourmet meal is difficult. A robot can get into a lot of trouble doing that and set the house on fire.

### 🌟 セクション 16

It can accidentally, I don't know, stab somebody. I don't think we're going to see that in the next 2 years. I hope we might, but we're not quite there yet. But there's tons of stuff that you can do around the house that doesn't take a lot of coordination. Picking all the stuff off the floor and putting it into a designated bucket, maybe putting clothes into a hamper, maybe picking up the trash bag and just putting it by the door.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Like, there's a million different things that if it was automated, it would have real function, real use. Now, individually, those little tasks might be dismissed. They're not that big of a deal. But if you had some robotic assistant around your house that just 24 hours a day just handled those minor tasks that don't require a lot of intelligence or coordination, that effect kind of in the aggregate would be noticeable. Your house would be a lot more organized, a lot cleaner.

### 📋 セクション 18

You as the human would still do kind of like the the higher level tasks. You'd still cook. You'd still have to figure out how to wash your do your laundry, stuff like that. You're you're probably going to be loading your dishwasher, unloading your dishwasher. But the dozens of little tasks here and there, we're going to start to be able to kind of outsource it to our robotica butler.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And I think we should call those tasks and those kind of automations the robotic slot. Next, I think there's going to be some big news in AI agents and cyber security, some sort of a data breach or a massive cyber security attack. Either that or a massive breakthrough in terms of how we run cyber security defense. Recently Sam Alman published something saying that they're approaching the high risk level in that specific category, the cyber security category. In the previous decades, there was this cat and mouse game where the cyber attackers, cyber the defenders, bad guys, good guys.

### 📝 セクション 20

It was kind of an arms race, but it was more or less stable, right? One side never completely made the other side obsolete. It was kind of in balance. I think we might see something that kind of signals that AI might shift this the sort of the scales one way or another. Maybe we'll see a massive kind of new powerful ability to create sort of cyber security defenses.

### 💡 セクション 21

Perhaps an AI model just sitting there cranking out different ways and vectors of attack and then figure out how to patch it and then just sort of like shipping those patches telling everybody how to like create defenses. So it's kind of like running in a simulation all the possible vectors of attack, creating defenses, then kind of publishing those so people can go ahead and implement them to to patch their security flaws, etc. Or we're going to see a massive increase on the cyber sort of on the offensive side. Maybe models will allow people with no technical ability to conduct large scale attacks and defense is going to suffer as a result because it's going to become much more difficult to sort of defend against those massive massive attacks. Either way, I feel like in the next two years, we're going to see the scales shift one way or another.

### 🔧 セクション 22

There's no reason why everything should kind of stay in equilibrium. I'm certainly voting for the the cyber defenses to increase, but that might be, you know, overly optimistic, but we're going to see some crazy stuff happening in that space. The next one is a little bit of a lower sort of percent chance that I'm willing to give it. It's something that I'm hoping will happen, but it might take longer. Definitely maybe more like 5 years, but I believe we're going to see the first AI design drug past the FDA sort of certification, get FDA approval.

### 🎯 セクション 23

That one's a little bit harder to predict because again, it's involving kind of governments and humans, etc. It's not moving as fast as the AI is, but it'll be interesting to see if Deep Mine, their isomorphic labs or one of the other labs working in this field, comes up with a brand new drug that is very sort of promising, how quickly will the government move to approve it? Will the fact that was AI generated, will that help push it through faster or slow it down because people are afraid of it being a little bit more sort of novel? So I would give it like a maybe like an 80% chance of happening within the next 5 years. And finally, I also think that because of how there's more and more synthetic data and how a lot of the sort of the human data has been already incorporated to train the models, etc.

### 💭 セクション 24

I think synthetic data is going to be the new gold. high quality databases that are generated curated by AI whether that's for music or images or text I think are going to be very very valuable and I believe that the copyright deadline will sort of pass right because if an AI model used your song to do its training right a lot of the courts are trying to figure out is that copyright infringement or not but let's say while that's happening all those models are already being trained they're producing their own music then if we're using that music to train the next generation of models. Well, that's no longer copyright infringement because it's sort of they're using AI generated music for that. If this is in fact a realistic scenario, then at some point sort of the the courts and the copyright laws at some point that sort of deadline has passed, it doesn't matter what that V1 version of the AI model was trained on because now we're on V2, E3, V4, and those were mostly or or entirely trained on synthetic data. So this might be kind of a big blow to artists and and musicians and stuff like that because there's this perception that those things were sort of stolen.

### 📌 セクション 25

That's a big contention whether you know AI models being trained on something is that actually stealing or is it similar to how a human being you know reads a book reading a book is not copyright infringement only reproducing it in its exact form or or very similar is if you listen to a bunch of dubstep music and then you created your own sort of dubstep music. But that's not like everything that you've heard. It's similar, but it's unique. It's different. We don't say that's copyright infringement because you've listened to that sort of music in the past.

### ✅ セクション 26

So the same argument can be used for these models. They listen to a bunch of songs right here and they produce something that is similar sounding, maybe the same genre, but it's a brand new and unique song. And that's where a lot of the fighting and the illegal disputes are happening right now. But assuming that synthetic data is used in the future, well, at some point that will no longer be relevant. Oh, one more prediction.

### 📚 セクション 27

There will be a lot more interest in how to transition to the new economy. As AI takes over, there's more job displacement and automations. We're going to be seeing more ideas that propose some course of action. But of course, we're also going to see a lot more noise and anger and people just saying like, shut it all down, right? They just want to stick with what we've known.

### 🔖 セクション 28

kind of go back into the past before this technology was invented. And yeah, maybe they'll even have their way. They'll be able to slow it down, at least in their own country. But ideally, we'll have some more forwardlooking plans for how to transition, how to work less, for for people to have a higher standard of living, etc. Because, you know, that's coming whether we like it or not, whether we're comfortable with it or not, it's uh heading at us like a freight train.

### 🎨 セクション 29

All right, let me know what you think and I'll see you in the next
