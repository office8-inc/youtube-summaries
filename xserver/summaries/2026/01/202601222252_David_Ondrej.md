## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Open Code is an open source AI agent that lives in your terminal and can do anything on your machine and it works with any AI model and you can give it any task. In this video, I will show you eight insane use cases that save me many hours every week. From finding leads to organizing files to data analysis to deep research, Open Code can do all of these. However, I do have to warn you, this AI agent is extremely powerful. It will do whatever you ask.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, make sure to use it ethically. Now to begin using open code, just go to open code.ai. Copy this terminal command. Type in terminal. Boom.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

This will open the global terminal on your computer and then paste it in and hit enter. This will install open code if you already have it. It will update it. And there you go. You can type in clear to reset the terminal.

### 📝 詳細説明

The next thing you need to do is type in open code of login. This will show a series of different providers for AI models from Open Code Zen which is their own to enthropic, GitHub, OpenAI, which by the way this is probably the best because a lot of you already have a CHG subscription whether it's the pro or the plus doesn't matter. You can just select that go to this link obviously will be a unique link for you. Just copy that. Boom.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Paste that in. I'm going to select my personal account because u I have the pro subscription. And there we go. Authorization successful. We go back to the terminal.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

You can see login successful. And then I can just type in open code and it will launch the open code agent globally on my machine. Amazing. Now once you go through the authentication the next step is to just type in open code into any terminal. So that could be your global terminal or it could be a terminal inside of an IDE like I did here inside of cursor.

### 🎯 応用例

And as you can see it launches open code. If you want to customize the colors just do / themes. But this is it. See the build mode either build or ask. You see the model and you see the provider.

### 💭 考察

Now, to make open code a lot more powerful, we're going to give it an MCB server so that it can operate the browser. So, first off, I'm going to CD out of this. Boom. There we go. Uh, I cd to the root folder of my computer.

### 📌 まとめ

And then I'm going to launch Open Code right here. I'm going to ask it make sure to edit the following file. Paste that in at/openode/openode.json. If it doesn't exist, create it. Otherwise, just edit it so that it has the following JSON.

### ✅ 結論

and then control commandV mcp.json just to show you what that looks like. This is the schema we need to give it. Right? So the mcp chrome dev tools and this here's how you install that mcb server. Now again uh this is just to show you this file is irrelevant.

### 📚 追加情報

We can delete it but I paste it in open code compresses it these nine lines is that JSON I just show you. Do not change anything else. Boom. Enter. So as you can see this is the same JSON.

### 🔖 補足

Feel free to pause it and copy it. It's finding the file. It listed it out. Doesn't exist. Directory exists, but the file doesn't exist.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, it created it and it's done. So, now if I open a new terminal and type in open code, drag it here. This one, the new one, it should be MCP server tomcp. There we go. Chrome dev tools connected.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So now we can give it a lot more things to do. Now, the first use case I'm going to show you is finding highquality leads for any business. So, I'm going to go into the prompt area and I'm going to speak it. I need you to find highquality leads for my business of implementing AI NA10 automation for local businesses. Personally, I live in Warso, Poland.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So, I need you to find businesses that would be ideal for this and find their contact info online and save them into a clear markdown file. Get to work. Answer in short. Boom. Here's the prompt.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I spoke into existence. Literally one paragraph. And now, Open Code is going to get to work. It created a list of to-dos. Research ideal businesses for NAN automation.

### 🎬 セクション 17

It's using web fetch. Okay, maybe let me interrupt it. I'm going to press escape twice and say make sure to use the Chrome DevTools MCP to execute any of these web tasks cuz I want to watch it work. It's probably not the most efficient, but it's going to be a lot more visual. There we go.

### 📋 セクション 18

Boom. It I'm not doing anything. It's using it by itself. We can make it side by side actually. Let's make it on the side.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Open code on the left. I'm going to let it do stuff. It's literally operating the browser by itself, guys. Crazy. You can give it real tasks and will do it.

### 📝 セクション 20

Now, it's searching businesses. See, personally, I don't speak Polish, so I don't even understand half the stuff, but uh obviously it can easily understand it. Right now I'm using Opus 4.5 but even the latest Open AI models GBD 5.2 can easily understand any language. Cool. So it's looking for e-commerce businesses.

### 💡 セクション 21

And keep in mind my prompt was very basic like my prompt is doesn't even say what type of businesses you know it's just like ideal for my business model. And you can do this whether you're a personal trainer, whether you have a sona, whether you have a gym, whether you have a construction business, whether you're electrician, doesn't matter. You can give it real tasks and it will do them. Cool. So now it says I've collected great data.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Let me update it through and create a marker file with all the leads. And keep in mind this was like 60 seconds, 90 seconds, very fast. So boom, here we have a new file. It found 33 businesses that are all from Warsaw. Marketing agencies, real estate, accounting firsth.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So let's look at it. And uh here are the businesses, their addresses, their websites. 1 minute 41 seconds. So literally 101 seconds, we have a list of 33 leads. Guys, we really are living in the future.

### 💭 セクション 24

But if you think this is insane, just wait until you see what's coming because we have seven more use cases that Open Code can do. All right, the second use case is going to be organizing files and folders. So again, let me start open code. Boom. I'm going to say find the downloads folder on my device.

### 📌 セクション 25

Analyze it to find the 20 oldest files in there as well as the 20 largest files and present them to me in a clear format. Do not delete them just yet. Boom. So, a lot of you, myself included, have a tons of unnecessary files and folders on our computer and we can use open code to help us organize this, right? So, it'll find the downloads folder.

### ✅ セクション 26

And some of this might need to be blurred, by the way, because these are my actual files and some of it might be personal, but I wanted to clean up my downloads folder, right? It's probably too long, too large. Let me see how long it is. Downloads. Get info.

### 📚 セクション 27

Yeah. So, 20 GB in my downloads and 2,400 items. So, way too many files. So now it's giving me the lists, right? Top 20 largest files, mostly video files, raw photos.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Okay, so let's look at it. Oldest files. Yeah, none of these seem to be important. So I think we can delete them all. Let's look at the 20 largest files.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And I think we can probably delete all of them as well. So now get to work and delete both the 20 oldest files as well as the 20 largest files. Do not delete anything else. Boom. In a matter of a few seconds, it'll help me save a lot of space inside my downloads folder and uh stay a bit more organized, which again manually I could do it, but would take me probably 10 15 minutes.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Open code is just one or two prompts. There we go. One fuzz special character issue. Oh, this is a video from the second channel. By the way, this video will be cross-osted on my second channel, which is more focused on software and how to build an AI software company.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, if you're interested in that, make sure to subscribe. The link to my second channel will be below the video. So, it says it freed around 15 GB. Let's verify that. I'm going to right click on the downloads folder again, get info.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And there we go. It's true. So, it went from 20 GB to 4.3 GB. So, saving me 15 GB of storage. Very nice.

### 🎬 セクション 33

The third use case I'm going to show you is using Open Code to analyze lots of data and to visualize it. So, here I have a Markdown file with over 250 startup ideas. And you can look at the first few, but we're going to blur the rest because these are only available to the people in my accelerator. But, as you can see, this is over 1,000 lines. It's over like 250 different AI startup ideas.

### 📋 セクション 34

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use open code to analyze it. So read add startup ideas and analyze all of the startup ideas inside organize them into different categories and create a visual obsidian style graph that groups them into clusters and output that graph as a PNG file. This is multiple tasks in once. And again could you do this manually? Sure.

### ⭐ セクション 35

But you need the right skill set and even if you have the right skill set, this is minimum 60 90 minutes of work. Open code is going to do that in less than a minute. So now it's writing a Python script to categorize all these ideas before it can generate a graph. And notice how anytime we give it a task, it creates these to-dos. Now this time it was pretty easy because I listed it out.

### 📝 セクション 36

But in previous tasks, it did it by itself. So instead of trying to do like one big thing at once, it breaks it down into three to five steps and then focuses on one step at a time. And by the way, pro tip, this is how you should work as well. A lot of you guys when you're starting out and you're trying to build a business or you're solving a big problem, you get overwhelmed by a big task. Just break it down into four smaller tasks and focus on each of these subtasks one at a time.

### 💡 セクション 37

This is such a good productivity tip. Make sure to use it in your life and business. Okay, so it finished writing 400 lines of Python. Now it wants to install dependencies. So in install mattplot lib, it wasn't there.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Now it installed it and it'll visualize it and save it as a PNG file. It started. Okay. So it created a virtual environment to run it in there. And we have the PNG now.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So verify if PLG was created. It's going to update the to-dos. And we can actually go to the right and give us the final answer. I've analyzed 234 stars from your file and organized them into 21 categories. The obsidian style graph has been saved as startup ideas graph.png.

### 💭 セクション 40

So as you can see the categories are AI infrastructure and APIs, niche tools, HR recruiting, AI development tools, productivity personal tools. Yes, stuff that I have expertise in. No surprise. But let's look at the PNG file. Wow, very nice.

### 📌 セクション 41

We can zoom around and explore this. This is very nice. Travel lifestyle consumer apps. Super cool. Fine-tuning ML ops enterprise and B2B automation and agents.

### ✅ セクション 42

Very, very nice. And again, how long was it? 2 minutes. Crazy. The fourth insane use case I've been able to find for open code is custom deep research.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, let me give you an example. I'm going to paste in a prompt. Execute deep research on the topic how to reduce no show rates for sales calls. This could obviously be any topic that you're interested in using YouTube as the primary source or you could say using Reddit as the primary source. And there we go.

### 🔖 セクション 44

It opens the web browser again and it goes it controls the browser and it's going to execute the research. So obviously it needs to close this warning. It can click amazing. How to resur rates should click on a video and find the transcript. And again guys my hands are not involved.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It's using the MCP tool that we set up earlier to operate the browser. So first it opened this tool to find these right videos from Dlog, Sabres, Sububi, Tyson, a bunch of people. It just found these videos and now using YouTube DLP which is a I think Python library it's going to find the transcripts of the videos and analyze these transcripts and give us the answer as to how what's the best way to reduce not show rates. Right? So it wrote a Python script using uh YouTube transcript API to get the transcript of these videos.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Seems to struggle to get the transcripts in a bunch of different ways. So it's trying things. It doesn't give up on the first error. Notice that it keeps trying, keeps going until the task has been completed. All right, there we go.

### ⚡ セクション 47

It found something that works. YouTube transcript API. So, it would probably had an older version. I've successfully retrieved transcripts for the videos. The output was truncated, but let me save this as a file to read.

### 🌟 セクション 48

All right, so smart. Instead of being satisfied with just 14 seconds of transcripts, it's going to save it as a full file. So, it's even does its own context engineering. I've collected substantial transcript data for multiple videos. Let me read the remaining transfer content and then compile the research brief.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And again, completely handsoff. It's doing all of this. I just gave it an initial prompt and it's doing deep research. And this is way more photo deep research than just JGB or proxy. You can customize a lot.

### 📋 セクション 50

You can tell it which sources you want, how you want to research, how you want to output anything you can want. And it has access to these libraries that you cannot execute inside of JGBT. Why? Because open code runs locally. It's fully open source.

### ⭐ セクション 51

It's locally in your machine. It can do a lot of things. Now, of course, there is still a risk that it's going to mess up some files on a computer because it's not isolated, right? So, if you want something that's fully private and secure, use Agent Zero. It can do everything that Open Code can and more.

### 📝 セクション 52

But Open Code is just more focused on coding. Agent Zero is focused on everything else. So, actually, for a task like this, I would definitely use Agent Zero. And in fact, recently I made a whole in-depth video on how to set up Agent Zero and how to use it. You can watch that right here.

### 💡 セクション 53

It'll also be linked below the video. There we go. It finished writing the report. Let's look at this. Nearly 300 lines of in-depth research on what to do to decrease no show rates.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So yeah, this is a very very thorough deep research. It took 5 minutes. I gave it a single prompt, just a one paragraph in plain English. And here we have it. YouTube research, how to read your social rates.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Total videos analyzed 13 combined view 75,000. Even the date source YouTube executive summary details of each video transcript. Yeah, this is very very thorough. And again, you can do this on any topic in any industry. Have a very nice output that like a lot of the times you would have to pay a consultant thousands of dollars to do this.

### 💭 セクション 56

Or again, if you wanted to do this yourself manually, be prepared to give it a half of a day or a full day to watch all these videos and create a nice report like this. But for Open Code, it was just 5 minutes and 15 seconds. The next use case is something that all of us can do and should do every now and then, and that is to figure out why our computer is getting slower. So, I'm going to paste in the prompt. I prepared find out why my computer has been running slower recently.

### 📌 セクション 57

Uh check load averages, memory pressure, disk space, stack processes, and swap activity. Basically, analyze my entire computer and figure out why it's running slower and then give me a report. I told it do not make any changes yet. Do not delete any files yet. I just want a report to figure out why my MacBook has been slower than usual.

### ✅ セクション 58

Now, to be honest, it hasn't been slower than usual. Uh but hey, if you have an older PC or if you notice some slowness, single prompt to open code and like what is it? 20 seconds and we're already getting an answer. Bas says, "Here are the top five reason your MacBook was slower than usual. High load average system up time.

### 📚 セクション 59

Your system hasn't been rebooted in 11 days. It's the beauty of MacBooks. Uh I remember when I was younger and using Windows. I had to restart it every day." Brave browser resource hog. Yes, I'm using Brave browser with many open windows.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Docker VM. That's agent zero. Obviously I'm using agent zero at all times running locally instead of sending all my data to open anthropic which then train on those data and you know sell it to palanteer but hey I cannot go too much otherwise they're going to shut down the channel. Uh but yeah Windows server OBS yeah obvious OBS is clogging a lot of CPU obviously I'm recording. Okay so very nice report of why my Mac is slower than usual and then if this was an actual problem we could solve these one by one.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So, if you have an older computer, all it takes is a single prompt to open code and it can help make your old slow PC fast again. All right, so the next use case I'm going to show you is pretty insane. It's using open code for writing articles for your website. Now, in the past, this used to be called SEO, search engine optimization. Now, this is still a thing, but what's becoming even more important is AEO, answer engine optimization.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Now, there's different terms for this, like GEO, generative engine optimization, doesn't matter. Basically, it's optimizing your website for traffic from AI because soon enough nearly 100% of the visitors will be different AI agents that are browsing the web. So, I gave open code a very ambitious task. Use the MCP Chrome tool to browse different sources comparing the existing code review AI tools for your CSA products. Now, this obviously could be any article topic you want.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Could be different diets, could be how to increase your testosterone, whatever is relevant to your product, to your niche, to your industry that you want to write an article on and put it on your website. Just replace this part of the prompt. Next up, research how to optimize articles for AI agent traffic. See context. So here in the context below, I just explained what this is, right?

### 🌟 セクション 64

What is AI agent traffic? Brainstorm five different articles relevant to topic based on the sources. Pick the best idea. Actually write the article yourself. Save as MD file.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Build a simple single HTML website in this codebase. Put the article in there. improve the design so it looks unexper this could be a position in a company research the topic write the article and deploy it on a website like this would be a full human job in the past now it's it's a single prompt to open code so let's see how it's doing it's a definitely the most complex use case so far all right so here's the MD file we have the article scroll down it's pretty long article 354 lines but hey hopefully it's optimized for agent traffic. I know nothing about a or g optimization, but open code does because it researched it, right? So now it's building the single HTML website.

### 📋 セクション 66

And this works with any framework, whether you use React or you use Angular, whatever you use for your website. Open code can design the article and help you deploy it. That's the main thing. It can do the end to-end process. So if you want more users, if you want more traffic to your website and you're not using tools like Open Code to write articles for you, you're falling behind.

### ⭐ セクション 67

This is literally so free. The difference is first of all knowing that this is possible and number two doing it. Thanks to videos like this, you know it's possible. So make sure to subscribe so you don't miss future uploads like this. But the second thing is actually doing it right.

### 📝 セクション 68

Most people are just chronic watchers. They just watch. They, you know, productive procrastination. They never execute. They never do.

### 💡 セクション 69

Thanks to AI and AI agents, you have so much leverage. If you actually have the slightest big bit of ambition and the slightest bit of work ethic, you're gonna out compete everybody else, especially in 2026 because AI agents have gotten so good. That's why you really cannot fall behind on this. And again, I'm just sitting back, guys. Like I I could be reading a magazine.

### 🔧 セクション 70

I could be going to a cafe. I could be driving my car, which I don't have any car. You get the point, right? I could be doing anything else, but Open Code is working for me. I just send a prompt, go outside, go to the toilet, take a nap, and it will do a full day's worth of work uh in a matter of minutes.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Insane. Really insane. All right, so Open Code wrote a 1,000line HTML file. This is kind of crazy. It took over a minute just to write a single file.

### 💭 セクション 72

I'm not scrolling all the way back. Okay, I'm not scrolling that. But uh let's look at it. Open a website using FCP tool. Again, not doing anything.

### 📌 セクション 73

It should open itself. Actually, is it even open? Where is it? Oh, there it is. Okay, I closed it.

### ✅ セクション 74

So, this is our article. Look at it. Best AI code review tools for CI/CD table of contents. This is clickable. You can guys this is a fully interactive website with styling animations.

### 📚 セクション 75

Crazy good report. Look at this. Code rabbit kodu sorcery kurasto. It's a good report on which are the best AI code review tools. Like this is crazy.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Took 10 minutes. Okay, this was the longest task so far. As I said was the most ambitious task so far, but open code managed to do it. It didn't crash a single time. It kept running for 10 minutes straight.

### 🎨 セクション 77

And not only did it research the topics, learn about how to optimize for AI agent traffic, write the article itself, and fully build a website and deploy it end to end all from a single prompt. Insane. All right. So, the next use case is using open code to create autonomous documentation. So, let's say you have project and you have a bunch of code, but you didn't do the best way of documenting it.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Well, guess what? Open code can come in and fill in that missing documentation. So, let me show you. I'm going to use my actual software that I'm building for my accelerator. Boom.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Let's hit clear. Open code. By the way, every person in my accelerator gets custom accountability software. And we're rolling this out uh this week. But anyways, I'm going to paste in the prompt.

### 🌟 セクション 80

Boom. Analyze this codebase and identify all areas where documentation is missing, outdated or incomplete. For each gap you find, number one, list the file function that needs dogs. Number two, explain what the code does. Number three, write the documentation for it.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Then create or update the readme.md and any relevant dog files. If the /docs folder doesn't exist, create one with proper structure. Start by exploring the codebase structure first. Do not change any code. Just create new documentation.

### 📋 セクション 82

So another use case that especially if you're a VIP coder, you need to be using, you need to be adding documentation because if you want other people or other AI agents coming into your codebase and being productive right away, you need lots of documentation and especially relevant documentation. Right? So now I'm using open code to fill that up. I have some basic uh readme file or whatever but admittedly this codebase specifically could definitely be better documented. So let's see.

### ⭐ セクション 83

We have nothing in the in the staging. So no changes made so far. So let's see what open code does. Will it find stuff that needs documenting? And if so, how will it do it?

### 📝 セクション 84

Will it just write comments? Will it create new files? Again, this is a at bigger companies, this is a full-time position, like adding documentation, making sure docs are up to date. Sometimes there's developers that spend half of their time doing this. Now, we can just single paragraph to open code and it'll do it.

### 💡 セクション 85

But again, you need to know this is possible and you need to actually do it. Otherwise, there's no point. Now, let me read the key source files to identify documentation gaps. I'll read the main applications. All right, so now it's reading files.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Look how fast it's executing these tools. Amazing. Open code is very optimized for speed. It's doing a lot of these in parallel as well because there's no way it's deploying it so fast. And by the way, this is the difference between just an AI model like cloud open 4.5 and a full agent like open code the harness the prompting the tooling.

### 🎯 セクション 87

This is what sets it apart. All right, based on my analysis here are documentation gaps files missing request headers. Okay, let me now create or update the documentation. So it found the biggest issues. Okay, read me file describes the landing page VSSL but codebase is actually an accountability dashboard.

### 💭 セクション 88

So it's completely outdated. readme file. So, it fixed that. Look at the to-dos. So, it created a bunch of to-dos to fill in the missing documentation.

### 📌 セクション 89

And again, I'm just chilling. I'm just commentating what it's doing. You can give it this task. Go back, you know, browse Twitter, do anything else you want to do. Maybe respond to some emails, whatever other tasks you have, and just let open do this.

### ✅ セクション 90

And this is a use case that anybody building any type of software can start using today. All right. So, it's on the last to-do. And again, this one is taking a few minutes because each of these files is 200 300 lines. It's very thorough documentation.

### 📚 セクション 91

Uh admittedly, I could have told it to be bit more concise, but it's doing a good job. Okay, it's trying to document everything thoroughly and it created the new docs folder. We have API reference architecture offflow components deployment development. So, anybody or any AI agent that codes into this codebase will now have a much easier time getting up to speed. even creating a index.mmd as a documentation hub with explain everything and the last updated file.

### 🔖 セクション 92

So it needs to like it shows you when it was updated to see how outdated outdated the documentation is and whether it needs another update. And again I can run this in 14 days in a month to go through everything again and update the documentation so it's up to date. And again this was less than 8 minutes. This is thousands of lines to in total. Look at this.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Boom. 80 lines. This is 284. Let's at the bottom 321. This one is 330.

### 🚀 セクション 94

This one is Yeah, this is thousands of lines of documentation in 8 minutes. Doing this manually would be a pain and I would never do it. So say now com pull the latest from GitHub, do a commit and push it. Okay, so you know in 2026 you don't have to do your commits. You can just delegate it to AI Jones.

### ⚡ セクション 95

I mean it was possible in 2025, let's be honest. But hey, I'm just going to show you with open code. Oh yeah, the main branch is master. It just, you know, gives you more aura if you're if you name your main branch master. But hey, realistically, it doesn't matter.

### 🌟 セクション 96

So it pulled uh recent logs, checks recent logs, recent comments with git log. Now it does a comment and it's going to push it. It's crazy. You can literally automate anything in 2026. Wild.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Wild. All right. The use case number eight for open code is going to be how to use it to build an interactive pitch deck for any idea you might have. So here's the idea. The first startup mobile app that would remove all frictions from recording videos and posting them on social media.

### 📋 セクション 98

Super simple. Feel free to pause and read it. But that's not the main point. The main point is that I have prepared a detailed prompt for open code to create an interactive investor pitch deck for this idea. So as you can see it gives a role goal text tag the idea being pitched pitch deck slides and open code should create an interactive pitch deck that could be sent to potential investors so that we can get funding for this idea.

### ⭐ セクション 99

So a lot of you are building startups and maybe you don't have you cannot bootstrap it right with vectal what I did is I bootstrapped it and that's what allowed me to build it myself and from founding to acquisition was 14 months so from literally choosing the idea to selling it for 1.8 million took me 14 months but it was possible because I already had successful businesses and I could fund it myself. If you need funding, which in this case, you know, it's debatable. AI has made it more possible than ever to build startups. But let's say some ideas still require funding. Some startup ideas are more complex than others.

If you knew, you need a proper pitch deck. You need to pitch investors, right? And you cannot just do that with a amateur not research pitch deck. And maybe you don't even know what a pitch deck looks like. Well, guess what?

### 💡 セクション 101

Open code can build one for you. So again, I from a single prompt that describes this idea, describes the target avatar, and tells it to build a pitch deck. And now, Open Code creates a list of to-dos like always and gets to work. And by the way, if you want to take it to the next level, what you could do is for each investor that you're pitching, include details about that investor and create a new custom personalized pitch deck that appeals specifically to that person. So, personalization is a huge thing in the age of AI.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Well, in the past, maybe you were doing an email campaign and you know, you have 1,000 leads and you had to say send the same email. Guess what? Now, you can make these way more personalized. So, yeah, AI is going to be huge. AI agents are huge for personalization and if you aren't using them you really are are missing out because you can have higher converting ads you can have a more open rate in your emails you can have a more successful page decks whatever like wherever personalization makes sense use AI agents to personalize like it's worth it you just need to you just need to try you just need to do it yes there's a friction using tools like open code might be intimidating for the first time because it runs in terminal but guess what it also has a dedicated app with a graphical user interface but the you really have to f push through the first 30 minutes, first may maybe 60 minutes if it's, you know, if you're a beginner and you're not familiar with terminal.

### 🎯 セクション 103

But if you can sit down and push through the friction and actually implement one or two of these use cases I showed you, you're going to be ahead of 99% of people because most people are just going to watch this. They're going to be like, "Wow, open core is insane." And then they're going to go to sleep and wake up the next day and forget about it. They're not going to do anything. Okay? If you actually want to be one of those people who completely changes their life in 2026 and gets ahead of everyone else, sit down when you finish watching this, block out 60 minutes and actually implement one or two of these use cases that make sense for you with open code and start using it dayto-day.

### 💭 セクション 104

You will like trust me, you will thank me later because these AI agents have gotten so good, people just don't know how to use them. So I guess that's my job to research that and communicate it to you in an easy to understand way. Again, if you want more videos like this and if you want to be on the cutting edge of AI, make sure to subscribe. That way, YouTube serves you videos about AI agents and that way you can stay ahead of the competition. So, again, please subscribe.

### 📌 セクション 105

It's completely free and it takes 2 seconds. All right. Open code is still writing, still creating our pitch deck. Uh, it created a new folder to stay organized. Very nice.

### ✅ セクション 106

And it's going to be a full Wow. So, it's not just a single HTML file. It's using Vite. It's going to be a nice website. Yeah.

### 📚 セクション 107

It's crazy. The cost of developing software is falling through the roof. I mean, I just spent like $0.8 to create a pitch deck that could raise me hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of dollars depending on your connections and your idea. But, uh, yeah, the leverage is insane on people who can execute. Entrepreneurs are going to be way more valuable, and there's going to be more entrepreneurs than ever.

### 🔖 セクション 108

And you're going to be able to build a multi-million dollar company with less people than ever. Uh, so what matters is not quantity of talent, but quality of talent. If people on your team aren't using AI, you are either a bad leader or you probably need to get a new team. That's the harsh truth because people who use AI are going to absolutely out compete people who don't. By the way, if you're wondering about this cap, this is a custom one of one vectoral cap and it is not for sale.

### 🎨 セクション 109

So, if you want it, too bad. Only one exists in the world and we probably won't make more. So, it's unfortunate, but I'm just answering comments ahead of time. Yo, it's really taking its time with this pitch deck. This this better be good.

### 🚀 セクション 110

Okay. Um, it created a bunch of files. It created an entire entire code base for this. So hopefully I'll be impressed. I thought it would be a bit simpler, but open code is really taking its time.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Look at this. Look at this. It's very interesting. It ran a TypeScript checker npm run build. It found a few errors and now it's fixing them practively.

### 🌟 セクション 112

Insane. Like the people behind open code really cooked with it. Okay, now it opens it using the MCP tool and look at this social video publisher. This is the startup idea and we have a whole pitch deck for it, right? Record once, publish everywhere.

### 🎬 セクション 113

seed drowned 1.5 million. Next, the problem. Content creators are drowning in publishing friction. Oh my god, this is guys, this is actually something I would need. So, I'm amazed because this is one of my startup ideas from the talk I showed earlier, which again, um, it's going to be blurred because that's exclusive to my accelerator.

### 📋 セクション 114

But man, whole pitch deck, the solution, animations, pricing, traction, competition. This is crazy. The team, the ask. Wow. Wow.

### ⭐ セクション 115

7 minutes and it's a fully built pitch deck that you could just throw up, deploy it real quick, send it to investors. Wild. I don't even know what to say, guys. Like the use cases are getting crazy. We need a new word.

### 📝 セクション 116

Like the word insane doesn't do it justice. We need something more insane than insane. But yeah, open code is crazy. U if you're not using it, you're missing out honestly. And um hopefully you found this video valuable.

### 💡 セクション 117

Now, if you actually see the potential of AI and if you understand that 2026 will be the year when few people get insanely ahead and the rest of population falls behind and if you want to do something about it and start your own business this year, make sure to watch this video. I just made a full breakdown of the best AI business models for 2026 and how to actually get started. So, watch it here. It'll also be linked below the video. That being said, thank you for watching and have a wonderful rest of the
