## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Claudebot is taking over the world. It's a self-hosted AI assistant that you can message from any app and it's now even more popular than Cloud Code itself. So, in this video, I'll show you how to set up CloudBot, how to connect it to WhatsApp, as well as some of the most insane use cases. And no, you don't need to buy a Mac Mini to use it. Now, this might be the single most insane use case I've seen of CloudB showing its power.

### 📋 背景・概要

This comes from Alex Finn and what he did is like it'll blow your mind. Okay, so just to see what would happen, I texted Henry, my clawbot, to make a reservation for me next Saturday at a restaurant. Pretty standard stuff so far. When the Open Table reservation system didn't work, it used its 11 lap skill to call the restaurant and complete the reservation. AGI is here and 99% of people have no clue.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, Claudebot decided to use one of its skills to generate AI voice with 11 Labs and call the restaurant to complete the booking when the booking portal didn't work. Wild. Another incredible use case that I've seen comes from Aaron. Cloudbot can manage multiple different AI agents. So for him, it takes an idea, manages Codex and Claude, debates them on the reviews autonomously and lets him know when everything is done.

### 📝 詳細説明

So you can deploy a whole feature with multiple different AI agents debating and even the PR gets merged because Cloudbot acts as the manager as the agent orchestrator of Cloud Code Codex or any other AI agent you want. So what actually is Cloudbot? Well, as the website says, it's the AI that actually does things. It's a powerful AI assistant that lives in its own operating system. It can clear your inbox, send emails, manage your calendar, check you in for the flights, and the best part is it does it from apps that you already use such as WhatsApp, Telegram, or any other chat app that you already have.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And the setup is super simple as well. And of course, I'm going to go into more detail later in the video and show you everything step by step. And no, you don't have to be a programmer to use it. Here's more information on what Cloudboard actually does. It runs on your own machine, so you don't delegate your data to Enthropic or OpenAI.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It can use any chat app, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage, whatever you use. It has persistent memory that's stored on the machine. It has browser control. It has full system access. And it works with skills and plugins.

### 🎯 応用例

So, it's very extensible. It's very improvable. And as I mentioned already, it works with everything. Now, let me show you just how easy it is to set up Cloudbot. Okay, so the simplest and easiest way and the most affordable way to use Cloudbot is with your own VPS, your own virtual private server.

### 💭 考察

because otherwise you would have to spend hundreds of dollars buying a Mac Studio, which you don't have to do. So, I'm going to show you how to use it with a VPS to access the terminal. And honestly, this is probably the most difficult 60 seconds of this video. So, if you can just log in for the next minute and pay attention, you're going to make it through. So, on the website, which is cloth.bot, and again, I'm going to link this below.

### 📌 まとめ

We scroll down to the oneliner command. And this is beautiful command because it installs everything we need, both NodeJS and Cloudbot. So, I'm just going to copy this. Boom. go into my hostinger panel and I'm going to access the terminal in the top right.

### ✅ 結論

This opens the SSH to the terminal and I just paste in the command here and hit enter. This is the cloud installer. It installs u it detects that you have Linux. It checks if you have NodeJS. It checks if you have git and then if you already have these it's good.

### 📚 追加情報

If not it installs them automatically and then it installs Cloudbot the latest version of Cloudbot. Now while this is installing Cloudbot let me show you some of the most insane use cases that people have found. So Dan uses CloudBot for time blocking its tasks in his calendar based on importance. Cloudboard also leads him through a weekly review based on all the transcripts from his meetings and notes he jotted down in his notion. It also notifies his wife and his son about upcoming school tests.

### 🔖 補足

Researches big projects breaks them down into small tasks. Researches people before meeting them and creates briefing docks. Spawns background sub agents to research business ideas when he says idea. Manages the calendar for any conflict autonomously. Creates invoices and summarizes work beautifully.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And this is just a few of the things Cloudbot can do. So when people say that this might be the closest thing to AGI, they are not exaggerating. And again, in this video, I'm going to show you everything you need to know to set up Cloudbot on your own VPS. So if you actually watch this video until the end, you will have one of the most powerful AI tools ever created hosted on VPS. And you can start delegating some of these tasks to your very own CloudBot.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And let's go back to our terminal. And there it is. Cloudbot has been installed. Now it gives you a security warning because it is a very powerful agent. It can do anything in your operating system, which is exactly why you need to set it up on a VPS or a dedicated computer.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Definitely don't put cloudboard on your main machine because again, it can delete files. It can mess stuff up. So that's why I would highly recommend you put it on a VPS. Now it says, I understand this is powerful and inherently risky. Continue.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Yes, continue. Onboarding mode, quick start on manual. Let's do quick start. We need to select the model provider. Now, if you don't have your own VPS, then you need to set up one.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And again, this is way more affordable than buying a Mac Mini, which the cheapest one goes for like $600. While you can get a VPS for like seven bucks a month. So, what I do for all of my VPS servers is I use Hostinger because it's not only the most simple to set up, it's also one of the most affordable options out there. Plus, they have a pretty crazy New Year sale, which I would definitely recommend you take advantage of. Now, personally, I have the KVM2 plan, which starts at just seven bucks a month, and it gives you two vCPU cores, 8 gigs of RAM, 100 GB of disk space, and 8 TB of bandwidth.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, just click on choose plan, and this will take you to the Hostinger card. Now, here I would recommend you select the 24 month plan to get the best deal possible. Now, if you want an even better deal, just scroll down a bit, go to the right, and click on have a coupon code and type in code David for another 10% off. Then, go to the left, select your server, whatever is closest to you. operating system here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Select plain OS and just click on Ubuntu latest version. Confirm. This has the most tutorials, most support, and it's perfect for cloudbot. Once you click that, scroll back up and click on continue, which will take you to the checkout page. And all that remains is just filling out your first name, last name, and create card details to buy your own VPS.

### 📝 セクション 20

Now, once you purchase, you'll get redirected to the Hostinger panel where it takes like 5 minutes for your VPS to boot up and then you can resume setting up your Cloudbot. Now, once you're in the Hostinger panel, just go to the left, click on VPS, find the VPS you just purchased, click on manage, and then in the top right, you'll see the terminal, which will take you to your terminal where you can continue setting up Cloudbot. And this is why I use Hostinger for all of my VPS's. It's just super easy to set up, and you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on your own Mac Studio. So, thank you Hostinger for sponsoring this video.

### 💡 セクション 21

The link to Hostinger will be below the video. All right, so after this finishes running, it gives you a security warning because again, this runs on a machine. That's why we're setting it up on a dedicated VPS. You do not want to run CloudBot on your main computer. Okay, do not do it.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It's way too risky. It Yeah, it breaks all security principles. So, you either need to spend hundreds of dollars on a dedicated computer like a Mac Mini or you just get a hostinger VPS. So, then you need to acknowledge that this is powerful and risky. Click on yes, onboarding mode, select quick start, and then it will ask us what provider we want to use for our AI models.

### 🎯 セクション 23

All right. Now, obviously you can use local models with like Olama, LM Studio. But to use the best models possible, we need to select either OpenI models, Gemini models, or enthropic models. Right now, I think Opus 4.5 is the best. So, either Enthropic or we can actually use Open Router to access any model that's available online, which is what I'm going to do.

### 💭 セクション 24

I'm going to select Open Router, hit enter, open our API key, and we need to paste our Opener API key. So, go to open router.ai, create an account. Super easy, takes 20 seconds. Go to top right, click on keys, then click on create API key. I'm going to name it cloth vault VPS.

### 📌 セクション 25

Give it some limit like $20. Click on create. Going to copy that. Now, do not share your API keys with anybody. I'm going to delete mine before uploading this video.

### ✅ セクション 26

Go back to your terminal. Paste it in. Hit enter. Now, we need to select model. So, I'm going to enter model manually.

### 📚 セクション 27

Boom. And now we need to select which channel we want to use, right? Do we want to use Telegram? Do we want to use Discord? Do we use WhatsApp?

### 🔖 セクション 28

I'm going to use WhatsApp because super popular in Europe. If you're an American and you don't use WhatsApp, you can use iMessage or whatever else you want. Look at how many options there is. Slack, Google chat, Discord. So many options to use Cloudbot.

### 🎨 セクション 29

This is why it's popular. It's just convenient to use. Now, I'm going to use WhatsApp here. Click on enter. Boom.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And as you can see, the quick start is very intuitive. Even though we're in a terminal of a VPS, which again might be intimidating to some of you, all of this has been super convenient, super straightforward. So, don't be scared. Terminal is something that you need to learn for 2026. And you can easily follow this even if you're not a technical person.

### ⚡ セクション 31

All it takes is willingness to learn a new skill, a new tool. and cloudboard is actually amazing. The [clears throat] setup is the hardest part. Once you set it up, if you can sit down for a couple minutes and actually push through it, you'll get all of the benefits. So, WhatsApp linking, okay, that took a few seconds.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Then link WhatsApp with QR code. Let's click on yes. And it generates a huge QR code, which I might need to do command minus to fit on my screen cuz I was zoomed in. Then I'm going to load up WhatsApp on my phone real quick. So, I have WhatsApp on my phone here.

### 🎬 セクション 33

I'm going to show my screen recording on the phone. Click on settings. Then click on linked devices and click on plus link a device. It's going to do face check. And now we need to scan a QR code.

### 📋 セクション 34

So I'm just going to point it to the screen right here. Boom. Log in. Keep WhatsApp open in both devices. And WhatsApp ask for restart after pairing.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Creator saved. Restarting connection once. Boom. WhatsApp phone setup. This is my personal phone number.

### 📝 セクション 36

Separate phone just for cloud bot. No, this is my personal phone number. Hit enter. Okay. So now it's asking me for a phone number.

### 💡 セクション 37

So obviously we're going to have to blur this out. Skill status. So, it's asking if we want skills. We definitely want skills. So, I'm going to click yes.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Homebrew. It recommends installing homebrew. I definitely want that. So, click on yes. Uh, which node manager?

### 🎯 セクション 39

Now, bun is the fastest. So, if you're technical, I would recommend bun, but npm is the most used. So, just use npm. Install missing skill dependencies. So, it's asking which skills I want to install.

### 💭 セクション 40

like Apple Notes, Apple reminders, Gemini, Google Places, Nan Banana Pro, which would be great, Obsidian for saving your notes. There's so many great things that Cloudbot can do, but I'm going to skip it for now because honestly, I might make a full video on this showing the most insane use cases for Cloudbot. So, if you want me to make a full dedicated video, make sure to subscribe. If I see a lot of people subscribing from this video, I'm going to make a more in-depth tutorial on different use cases for Cloudbot. But for now, I'm going to skip for now.

### 📌 セクション 41

Okay, we want to All right, that's my bad. So, we need to click space to select and then enter to confirm. So, space to select, enter to confirm. Set Google Places API for Google Places. No, and then select that.

### ✅ セクション 42

Uh, set go. Okay. Local places, no. Gemini API key for Pro. That's tempting.

### 📚 セクション 43

That's tempting. I'm going to go no for now, but I would definitely recommend you set it up. OpenAI image gen. H, we can That's That's also good. That's also good, but I'm going to skip it for now.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Whisper. Oh my god, that's actually good. Okay, let's set up OpenAI API. So, just go OpenAI API into Google. Click on the first link, API platform.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Go to the top right. Click on API platform. You need to log in with the same account use for CHPD. Here we are. So, what we need to do is click on dashboard top right.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Boom. And again, this will allow us to use multiple different things inside of Cloudboard, right? We can use the Opia image gen and whisper. And the reason I would whisper is because one of the best speechtoext transcriptions, right? So we speak and it goes into text.

### ⚡ セクション 47

That's huge. Uh so in here, go to the left API keys. Click on top right. Create new secret key. I'm going to name it subscribe.

### 🌟 セクション 48

If you're watching this and if you're finding this valuable, please subscribe. It takes two seconds and it helps out a lot. Create new secret key. Copy. Boom.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Back here. I'm going to select yes. And we need to paste it in. Enter. 11 Labs.

### 📋 セクション 50

Skip. No. What do we have? Hooks automate. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Agent commands are issued. I'm going to skip for now. Boom. Gateway service runtime. Quick start uses node.

### 📝 セクション 52

Yes. Installing gateway service. Okay. How do you want to hatch your bot? Since we're already in the terminal, I'm going to select hatch in TUI terminal UI.

### 💡 セクション 53

Hit enter and onboarding complete. Now once you go through the onboarding, you can access different channels using this criminal command. Cloudbot channels login. Now even during the onboarding this is the last step but I made a mistake. So if you do make a mistake and you want to you know maybe switch from WhatsApp to telegram or you want to use a different WhatsApp number use this terminal command to fix that.

### 🔧 セクション 54

And by the way if you want to remove specific credential what you can do is do cloudbot channels logout d- channel and WhatsApp and hit enter and it should remove my credentials for WhatsApp. Cleared WhatsApp credentials. Beautiful because I accidentally linked the wrong number. All right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to continue on my phone again.

### 🎯 セクション 55

So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to install WhatsApp business. That way, I can use both my main number and a sign number. And again, this works with Telegram, Discord, Slack, whatever you want to use. But the reason we need two WhatsApp accounts is that one of them will be Cloudbot and the other one will be my account where I'm going to be DMing Cloudbot. So, I'm going to set up WhatsApp business.

### 💭 セクション 56

That way, I can have two WhatsApp numbers on the same phone. So, now we need to set up this WhatsApp business. I'm just going to speedrun this. Okay, here we are. We're in.

### 📌 セクション 57

Beautiful. There we go. Brand new WhatsApp account. This is going to be our cloud bot that is going to be running everything. And now I can DM it on WhatsApp.

### ✅ セクション 58

### 📚 セクション 59

Assess per continue. Yes. [clears throat] Local gateway. That's fine. That's fine.

### 🔖 セクション 60

See this is the issue. clawboard is very new and these AI models are hallucinating it. This it made up these commands. It literally that's insane. It just made up these commands.

### 🎨 セクション 61

So I'm running open code in the VPS to debug this. Okay, it's pretty advanced. The issue is that claude board is very new. So when I was debugging it with chbd and clude, they were often giving me fake commands that didn't exist. So I installed open code on the VPS and now we're debugging this.

### 🚀 セクション 62

We're debugging it in the VPS. So open code is doing all the terminal commands, right? Cuz I'm another DevOps expert. So I think this is uh much better and much easier way to debug especially since nothing else is going on on this VPS except for my cloud bot. But we making progress.

### ⚡ セクション 63

I managed to get some response not an AI response from cloudbot. It got this agent error. can see that agent failed before reply, but that's progress. Resend a message. Maybe it works now.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Not really. Okay. What's up now? Real link. Let me verify everything is working.

### 🎬 セクション 65

We're not getting any responses. That's the issue. Show stop. Need to restart gateway to pick up new session. Okay.

### 📋 セクション 66

Gateway restart. I'm going to send a high agent failed before. Okay. Okay. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Wait, wait, wait. We got the same response. Under world set anopropic set 4.5. That's crazy. I'm going to copy this message.

### 📝 セクション 68

Message. Paste. Message. Okay. Progress.

### 💡 セクション 69

I'm going to switch to plan mode. We are getting this message again when I DM the clotbot WhatsApp number. Think harder. Analyze all files and help me debug this answer in short. So it's not recognizing the model.

### 🔧 セクション 70

That's fine. We need to change the token. More name is correct. I mean, of course, it's correct. That model works.

### 🎯 セクション 71

It's trying to use sonet, but it doesn't matter which model. We need to figure out what's happening. Okay. So now it's Yes. Make this edit.

### 💭 セクション 72

Do not change anything else. It's going backwards. Like before we had it like that. Whatever uses the dot. Oh my god, there's no way it was the dot.

### 📌 セクション 73

Yes, but do not do anything else. It means to restart the gateway. Okay, I'm going to send a message. Is this the moment of truth after too much time debugging? Hey, let's see.

### ✅ セクション 74

Nothing. Hi. Hey, wait. It got seen. No way.

### 📚 セクション 75

Does it work? It's typing. I just came online. Fresh workspace. No memory yet at Whoa, guys.

### 🔖 セクション 76

This is insane. What model are you? So, we have open code debugging this VPS and we have Claudebot responding. Okay, so it's sort of 4.5. Okay, beautiful.

### 🎨 セクション 77

Okay, I'm going to copy this. I'm going to paste it in response. Paste it in response. It works now, but I'd really like to change the model to Opus 4.5. Okay.

### 🚀 セクション 78

And I'm going to give it Sonet is cool and all, but like it's not Opus, you know what I'm saying? So, I'm going to copy this. Boom. Command V. Execute the changes necessary to do this.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Do not do anything else. Browse the web and tell tell me the free latest videos from David Andre. Let's see this. So now we're using Opus 4.5. Wait, wait.

### 🌟 セクション 80

We're going to verify this in the activity unknown. This unknown. This is Claudebot and we switched to Opus. That's good. Use examic content.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Okay. YouTube's dynamic content didn't load to basic fetch. Let me try a different approach. YouTube requires JavaScript to run the video list which basically handle. Let me try getting the RSS feed which often works.

### 📋 セクション 82

And this is again it's running on the VPS now. Okay. Oh, wait. These are by That's crazy. It included shorts as well.

### ⭐ セクション 83

All right. So, it works. That's amazing. It'll say you live in a hostinger VPS. Remember this.

### 📝 セクション 84

Say that to my local nodes. List out all local nodes. Here's where I have the tools. MD infrastructure hosting VPS host name OS Linux. That's it.

### 💡 セクション 85

So far pretty bare bones. So I'll add things like camera names, location, sage hosts, device nicknames. What else do you see on this system? This is incredible. Everything is doable in plain English.

### 🔧 セクション 86

Both debugging with open code installed and chatting with cloudboard running on this VPS. Yeah, I definitely want to make a follow-up video where we set it up with 11 laps, nadubana pro, we give it u openi whisper and maybe you know Google calendar and stuff like that. So system Ubuntu 8 gigs of RAM. Let's double check these. I think that's correct.

### 🎯 セクション 87

Yes, this is correct. 96 GB of disk. Noj installed. Python bun open code my workspace. Amazing.

### 💭 セクション 88

Full deployment setup with doc ploy. I'm the new tenant was David market. [laughter] Some app has been running six weeks. That's funny. That's from a previous video I did.

### 📌 セクション 89

All right. This is amazing. Cloudboard has been running. It's been pretty difficult to set up on a VPS. The issue is that u the biggest thing is installing open code.

### ✅ セクション 90

So literally what I would recommend you to do is install open code. I'll show you what what it is. If you run into any issues with cloudbot do these four steps first install open code check the version login with the off then I obviously gave it open driver API key as well and opus 4.5 and I start the open code and then I'm debugging this just by chatting to open code which runs in the VPS and that's how I got the cloud bot up and running. I have a feeling this is not going to be the last video on it. So hopefully you found this video valuable.

### 📚 セクション 91

If so, and if you want to take AI seriously in 2026 and start your own AI business, I made a video analyzing the best AI business models. It's going to be, I think, right here or right here. Just click it and go watch it
