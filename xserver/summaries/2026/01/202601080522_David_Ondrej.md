## 💡 概要

AIスタートアップVectalを7万人以上のユーザーに成長させ、創業からわずか14ヶ月で180万ドルで売却したDavid Ondrejが、最初の100人のユーザーを獲得するための4つの実践的な手法を解説。オーガニックマーケティング、コールドDM、マイクロインフルエンサー、SEOという無料または低コストで実行可能な戦略を、具体的なステップとともに紹介。製品開発と同じくらい流通（ディストリビューション）が重要であり、明確なターゲット顧客を設定し、痛みを解決する製品を作り、毎日最低45分をマーケティングに費やすことの重要性を強調している。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **5つの成功ステップ**: (1)製品と同じくらい流通が重要、(2)明確なターゲット顧客（ICP）の設定、(3)「ビタミン」ではなく「鎮痛剤」を作る（緊急かつ深刻な痛みを解決）、(4)毎日最低45分をマーケティングに費やす、(5)今すぐ始める（遅延は製品が求められていないリスクを高める）
- **オーガニックマーケティング**: 長尺動画（10〜30分）は短尺動画（30秒TikTok）よりも信頼構築に効果的。ニッチに特化すれば50〜200再生でも十分（例：30人の登録者で8,000ドル稼いだ事例）。製品ローンチ前から動画投稿を開始し、5日以内に1本アップロードする厳格な制限を設ける
- **コールドDMとマイクロインフルエンサー**: 最初の10人は個別対応（スケールしない方法）で獲得。競合製品に不満を持つユーザーを狙い、彼らが支払った金額を割引として提供。500〜2万フォロワーのマイクロインフルエンサーは価格設定を知らないため、バルク契約で50〜60%割引が可能
- **SEO戦略**: 製品キーワードではなく問題キーワード（「最高の編集ソフト」ではなく「動画の背景を削除する方法」）をターゲットにする。ClaudeやGeminiを使用してSEO記事を作成（ChatGPTは避ける）。各問題に対して別々のランディングページを作成し、比較ページ（「Adobe vs DaVinci vs 自社製品」）も活用

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Here is how to get your first 100 users for your AI startup. My name is David Andre and I've scaled Vectal, my AI startup, to over 70,000 users. And I recently sold it for $1.8 million just 14 months after founding. In this video, I'll teach you how to get customers. So, if you watch until the end, you'll know exactly what to do to get your first 100 users.

### 📋 背景・概要

First off, let me share with you the steps for success. Number one, you need to realize that distribution is just as important as the product. A lot of you only build the product, but you never think about the distribution. But having a unique distribution mechanism sometimes will make you more money than having a unique product. Another step for success is having a clear target avatar.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

This is a very easy thing to skip because a lot of first-time founders have the delusion that hey, my product is going to be useful for everybody. But trying to sell to everybody is one of the biggest mistakes you can make in the beginning. That's why you need to be focused on a clear target, a single ICP, a single niche, and a specific person so you can solve a real painful problem for that person. Which brings me to step number three. You need to solve a problem that's actually painful.

### 📝 詳細説明

A lot of you are building vitamins. You're building something that's nice to have, but not really necessary. Instead, you should be building painkillers, something that solves an urgent and intense pain that people are willing to pay a lot of money for. And by the way, this makes getting customers a lot easier. The fourth step for success is to spend at least 45 minutes per day on distribution.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And you really want to make sure that you time block this as the first 45 minute block of your day. Don't delay to the end. This is the most important thing. If you don't have any customers, you need to time block this segment of deep work just for promotion, just for distribution, just for marketing. And the fifth and final step for success is that you need to start now.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

The longer you delay marketing and getting customers, the higher the risk that you're building something that nobody else wants. And this is one of the deadliest things for first-time founders. You spend 6 months, 12 months, 18 months building a product that the market simply doesn't want. But if you try to get paying customers as soon as possible, and if you can't get them, then maybe you should be building something else. So the more you delay this, the higher the risk that you're going to waste your time.

### 🎯 応用例

So, I'm about to cover four different ways of getting your first 100 users that are either free or very, very cheap. But if you don't understand these five steps for success, everything else that I'm going to make in this video will not be as effective. So, screenshot this, remember this, and make sure to follow these steps for success. The first marketing method we're going to cover is organic marketing. And this simply means creating videos and posting them on social media.

### 💭 考察

And the first piece of advice I'm going to give you here is to create long- form content rather than short form content. And the reason is simple. When you create 10, 20, 30 minute videos, you build way more trust than 30 secondond Tik Toks or Instagram res. Personally, I would much rather have a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers than a Tik Tok channel with 100,000. Long- form content is simply that much more effective.

### 📌 まとめ

The second piece of advice when it comes to organic marketing is that nobody, and I mean nobody, is good on camera at first. This is one of the biggest excuses, one of the most common myths I see when it comes to people explaining why they cannot make videos or like, "Oh, I'm not good on camera. You know, I don't know how to speak, blah, blah, blah." Nobody is. When you start, you're going to suck. You're going to be awkward.

### ✅ 結論

You're gonna have to do multiple takes. But this is simply part of the process. Everybody starts that way. Trust me. So, stop using this as an excuse and start posting videos.

### 📚 追加情報

And if you like this style of brutally honest, nononsense practical videos and if you want to work with me oneonone, then click the link below the video because I'm going to be working with a select few startup founders to help them scale their AI software company. So, if you are serious about AI and if you are building an AI SAS, fill out the form below the video. Takes like three minutes and if you qualify, we can work together oneonone to help you scale even faster. Another common limiting belief is that you need millions of views to succeed. In fact, you don't even need thousands of subscribers.

### 🔖 補足

There I know many people that made a lot of money with less than 100 subscribers. For example, Patrick, one of our members in the new society, made $8,000 with just 30 subscribers. How did he do it? He made a single video which got like 200 views that was simply about manufacturing, nothing else. How to use AI in a manufacturing company.

### 🎨 セクション 13

someone who was running a $50 million manufacturing business saw it and paid him $8,000 for his consulting. And this is the power of going niche. So rather than trying to target everyone in this huge buy, you target a small section and you just make videos for these people. This is your target avatar. This is your niche that you're targeting.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Make videos for them. And even getting 50 views per video is much better than getting 50,000 if those are like kids or random people who have zero interest in your product. This is why you should go niche rather than going broad. Another thing that you should do is that you should be uploading even before the product is ready. So upload before launch.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So many people delay marketing or promotion after the product is ready. And the truth is it's never going to be ready. I know many friends who are building an AI startup who are always two weeks away from launching. And the problem is that all this time while you're building, you could already be getting customers, right? And there are two possible tactics.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Number one is the weight list. This one is super simple. You simply create a free weight list where you get their email, maybe their first and last name, maybe even their phone number. And this allows you to collect leads before launching. The second possible tactic is a pre-sale.

### 🎬 セクション 17

What this means is that you create a better offer before the launch, right? So maybe if you're planning to charge $200 a month for your software, maybe you do a pre-sale for 99 a month and everybody who buys it before the launch gets a really good deal. So no, you shouldn't wait until your product is ready, until it's fully launched, before you start advertising. Start uploading videos before you launch. And when I say uploading videos, I don't mean just one a month.

### 📋 セクション 18

You need to be doing more than that. And what I recommend is setting a hard limit. So unlike a traditional upload schedule where you're doing one video per week, a hard limit allows you to upload even more frequently, right? So maybe you get inspired and you want to upload in two days. But if your hard limit is 5 days, that is the maximum amount of time a video can take.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So as you have your, you know, calendar of a typical week, sometimes maybe you upload, you know, only one video and then on day five you upload another one. But let's say you're feeling inspired and you upload the next day instantly, right? This is why I recommend doing a upload limit instead of a schedule because schedule it makes you lazy. You know, you delay the work to the last day and sometimes you get inspiration the next day or in two days. So, you don't want to be doing, you know, once a week uploads.

### 📝 セクション 20

You want to set a hard limit so that you can upload more frequently if there's content and worst case scenario, you just upload on the last day. Now, to be more specific, there's three options I would recommend you to do in the beginning. either two days if you want to be aggressive, three days or four days. Anything more than this is simply being lazy. You don't need more than five days to make a video.

### 💡 セクション 21

You're not Mr. Beast. You don't even know how to spend 5 days productively to make the video good. Instead, you should be making a lot more videos about your product, showcasing your software, how to use it, so that you figure out what actually works and what doesn't work. You also want to be building the product in a way where it markets itself.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So this could mean a fancy UI that is like, you know, super visible and people like it and people share it. It could mean something like Spotify wrapped where it gives you a personalized, you know, summary every year of what you used, how you used it, something that you want to share naturally with others. It could also mean a small watermark in the corner of your UI so that when you make the content, you don't have to constantly make call to actions. It simply shows the name of your software in the bottom right corner. There's many different ways to do this, but if you're already building a product and designing the UI, just think of how to make it more sharable, more marketable.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Also, every single update you make to your software is naturally a new potential video idea. And if you do this well, you can get paid twice for the same amount of work because if you improve your product, all your current customers and your users will be happier. They'll stay longer. Your chair may reduce. And also, you can upload a video about that and get free content to advertise to get more customers.

### 💭 セクション 24

So the more you build, the more content you can make to get more users, which allows you to build even more, get more resources, get more money, and it's your own version of the flywheel. Just don't forget to actually make the content. Another thing you must realize is that by making videos, you build a priceless skill. The truth is that being good on camera will help you in many different ways. For example, creating great pitches to investors.

### 📌 セクション 25

Another example is paid ads. This could be Facebook, this could be Google Adwords, this could be Twitter, LinkedIn, any platform that allows you to run paid ads. It will also make you better at sales calls resulting in more sales because you're more confident, better spoken. It will also help you with recruiting so that you can attract and hire better, higher quality talent to your company. So instead of seeing a single upload as a piece of content, you say like, okay, this got only 20 views.

### ✅ セクション 26

it wasn't worth it. You have to look at it in a broader sense. You're building the skill of being great on camera, of being a great communicator, a great persuader. This is a priceless skill that will help you no matter what business you're trying to do. Now, a lot of people when they get to organic content, they want to make videos, they struggle with video ideas.

### 📚 セクション 27

And luckily, there's this very simple way to never ever struggle with video ideas ever again. and that is you brainstorm five video ideas every single day. Now important clarifier brainstorming doesn't mean you should be qualifying them right the process of brainstorming idea is very different than the process of selecting which idea to make. So what that means is that when you're brainstorming anything goes doesn't matter if it's bad doesn't matter if it's cringe you're just brainstorming. When you actually get to make the idea you select the best one.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, when you're brainstorming, don't limit yourself too much. Realistically, out of the fives you make, you know, most are going to be kind of bad. Let's say maybe three out of them. Maybe one of them is going to be like neutral. It's going to be an okay idea, and the last one could be actually good.

### 🎨 セクション 29

But the point is that if you do five a day, at the end of the month, you're going to have 150 different video ideas to choose from. And when you have 150 video ideas per month, you will never ever run out of ideas of what content to make. Plus, the likelihood of you choosing a great idea is much higher when you have 150 than if you have just 10, like most people. Now, once you actually start making content and once you're consistent with it, you need to realize that if it's not working, then you need to experiment with different formats. So, if a certain type of video isn't working, you need to try a different type.

### 🚀 セクション 30

If this type isn't working, try a different type. If this one isn't working, you try another one. And you repeat this process until something works. And then, and this is very important, once you find something that works, you make a lot more of it. Okay?

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, if this one, let's say the rectangle works, you make another rectangle and then another one and then another one. And every now and then, you try a bit more experimental and you try a star and then you do a rectangle and rectangle, right? But a lot of people when they finally find something that works, they only make it once. That's so dumb. Imagine all this effort, all these months that you spend figuring out what works.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And once you have something that got good amount of views, that got you a few customers, you don't repeat it, guys. Once you find something that works, you need to triple down. You need to lock in, work harder than ever, and make more of that content. And yeah, every now and then, you know, 20% of your uploads could still be experimental, but just make the stuff that works. So, here's how you do organic marketing, but this is not all we do at Vectal and Agent Zero.

### 🎬 セクション 33

I'm going to show you three other ways of getting customers that are also brutally effective. The second way of getting users for your AI SAS is cold DM. And if you're not sure what DM means, it stands for direct message, aka messaging people that don't know you. That's why cold DM. Now, maybe you already have some warm leads, right?

### 📋 セクション 34

If that's the case, you should start with these. But this is assuming that you have zero leads. You're starting from scratch. You don't know anybody. So, I'm going to teach you how to do cold DDMs.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Now, you can do cold DMs on basically any platform that allows it. So, could be Instagram, could be LinkedIn, could be X, whatever platform allows you to message other people, you can execute the strategy on. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. But David, DMing people is not scalable, and that's actually good. At the beginning, you need to be doing the unscalable thing.

### 📝 セクション 36

And the reason is simple. You have nothing to lose. You have plenty of time, but you don't have any paying customers. Also, this allows you to be personalized with each of the customers, aka you reach out to them oneonone. So, if you see that John has a wife and two kids and maybe he just got a newborn, you can congratulate him like, "Hey, John, congrats on your newborn." If you see that Adam recently was on a vacation, say like, "Hey, Adam, how was Croatia?" Yes, cold DMs are not scalable.

### 💡 セクション 37

You're not going to be doing them to build a billion dollar company. But right now, your issue is that you need more users. And that's where cold DMs are great because they're free and they allow you to stand out with personalized messages. Now, when you're getting started, you really need to spend at least half of your time on distribution. So, 50% of the time that you work every single day should be spent on one of these four marketing methods.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And the other 50% should be spent on actually building the product and the remaining 0% should be spent on everything else. And what I'm trying to say there is that everything else is basically distraction except building the product and advertising the product. So going to conferences, going to events, all of these things fall into the category of 0%. You should be spending roughly 0% on these things because they're not going to make you money and they're not going to make your product better. So if you are working four hours per day every single day on your AI software company, two of those hours should be doing these marketing methods and the two other should be actually building the product.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Because most of you right now are probably spending all four hours on just adding features, perfecting the product and just building. And you're probably spending around zero hours per day on promotion or marketing and distribution, which is the reason why you don't have any users. The secret to cold DMs is that you need to be DMing the right people. So you need to find people who are talking about the problem that your product solves. And what you do at first if you have zero motion is you offer to solve the problem for free.

### 💭 セクション 40

And the reason you do it is simple. You get some free users. You can see how the users actually use your product. And this allows you to get priceless feedback to improve your product. But also you will ask those free users for testimonials.

### 📌 セクション 41

Now if you cannot get good testimonials means your product is not good, which means you need to put more work in and make it good. But if you do a good job and these free customers are happy, guess what? Those free customers can turn into paying customers if they want to keep using your product. Also, you need to pitch it before you build it. Again, all of these four methods, you should be doing them no matter what stage your product is in.

### ✅ セクション 42

Don't wait for the feature to be finished. Don't wait for some magical MVP completion. Product will never feel finished. So, whether it's organic marketing, cold DMs, or the other two methods I'm going to teach you later in the video, start doing them now. Okay?

### 📚 セクション 43

That's the biggest takeaway from this video. Don't delay the promotion. Start doing it now. And let me prove it to you why you need to do this. You need to pitch before you build.

### 🔖 セクション 44

That way you can validate whether your ideal target avatar even has the willingness to pay for your product. Because again, the biggest mistake apart from not getting started, right? If you don't get started, that is the number one mistake. But the biggest mistake of people who actually get started in AI and who start building some SAS or some software company is that they build something that nobody wants. And it's a very painful lesson to realize.

### 🎨 セクション 45

And the way to prevent it is that you pitch your product before it's fully built. To even see if your target avatar has willingness to pay. If you pitch your product and you ask, would you actually be willing to pay for it? And they say, no, it's not really that big of an issue for my company. Guess what?

### 🚀 セクション 46

You shouldn't continue building that product. So either the people will be very unhappy when you ask them, are you willing to pay for it? Or they'll be like, oh my god, yes, this problem is so bad in my business. it's costing me thousands of dollars every month. I would pay you instantly if you could solve it.

### ⚡ セクション 47

And if that's the case, then you just got a very strong green light to triple down on everything you're doing. Finish the building the product and you know who your target avatar is because you just spoke to that person. Now, let me show you how I actually did this on Instagram back in the day when I was 16 and I knew nothing about anything and this was the first way I actually made money on the internet. So, first you find the largest accounts in the niche that you're targeting. Then you go to their latest post on their Instagram feed.

### 🌟 セクション 48

First step is you click on the likes, the people who liked this post and you start following the people who like the latest post. So let's say you're selling software to fitness enthusiasts, right? But it's specifically men over 50 who are into fitness, right? You find the largest influencers who are men over 50 and you go to their latest post, you click on the likes and you start following the people who liked their latest post. Now, a good percentage of those people, roughly 10 to 15% will actually follow you back because they're curious like, who is this person?

### 🎬 セクション 49

Why is he following me? And those are the people that you actually called DM. So, DM people who follow you. And what you DM them isn't some direct sales page. That's obvious.

### 📋 セクション 50

You do a casual opener, which has to be a question. Remember, these are cold leads. These people don't know you. You need to get them to start responding before you can sell them your product. So you do something like how's your Tuesday or did you see the football match this week?

### ⭐ セクション 51

Whatever is relevant, whatever makes sense, a simple question that those people would likely respond to. And once they are responding, then you can begin your selling. And obviously this will be different for every product and for every niche. But what you do is you go to Opus 4.5, which is the latest model from Claude. So you go to claude.ai AI and you tell it, please design a simple sales script for selling in Instagram DMs.

### 📝 セクション 52

Here is my product. Here is the problem it solves and this is my target avatar. You give it all the context that it needs and you have Opus 4.5 design a clear sales script custom for the people you're trying to sell. Now, every time you encounter a new objection that you cannot solve, maybe you know you get to this point, everything looks good, but they don't send the money and they say like I need to talk to my wife or whatever, then you ask it, how do I handle spouse objections? and you'll do some more research and you'll keep repeating your sales script until you're making sales.

### 💡 セクション 53

Now, I know this works because this is what I used to do when I was 16. And this is what took me from making no money at all, you know, and before I had my first business to making more money than my teachers in about a month when I started my first business. So, yes, this works and yes, it does take time, but if you don't have any users, you should be spending at least half of your time on getting customers. Another option and this one is very very nice is you target people from your competitor's products who posted a negative review about that product. So it's the people who do one star reviews, two star reviews on your competitor's software and you message those people and what you do is you give them a special offer.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So let's say this customer spent, I don't know, 200 bucks with your competitor and they had a terrible experience. They posted on it online. You DM that customer and you offer to credit this 200 bucks as a discount to your own software. Now, obviously, if you're good at math, you have to realize that you need to charge more than 200 to make a profit, right? And if you cannot do that, then you need to increase your prices.

### 🎯 セクション 55

A lot of you are charging too little, right? In building software, people think like, okay, I'm going to be $10 a month. I'm going to be $20 a month, maybe $30 a month. The truth is that the most successful software companies, they have annual plans and they have upsells, they have cross promotions, they have downells, they have so many different ways of making money and they have crazy high LTV. If you're getting started, you should first of all make an annual plan, you should make a two-year plan, and you should also increase your prices.

### 💭 セクション 56

So, if you have an app built and people cannot even buy something more than $200, you need to create a higher priced plan. So, in this example, let's say your product costs $500 per year. Well, guess what? When you're DMing this unhappy customer that use your competitor's product, you know that this customer has the problem that your product solves. So, this customer is already qualified.

### 📌 セクション 57

They already spent $200 trying to solve this problem. You know they have money. You know they have the problem you're trying to solve. They're a very qualified lead. You just need to present them with a good offer.

### ✅ セクション 58

And what makes a very seductive offer is when you take the $200, you subtract it from your annual plan and you only charge them $30 in this example. This makes it seem like, wow, this alternative product just gave me a discount on money that I spent with somebody else. They really care about me being the customer. And you'll be surprised how effective this offer is. Now, again, you need to make sure that you have something to sell that is more expensive than your competitors.

### 📚 セクション 59

Otherwise, the math will not make sense. Now, this is perhaps the most valuable tip I can give you when it comes to cold DMs, and it is to get a friend to do it with. So, the issue with cold DMs is trust. People don't know who you are, people don't know whether they can trust you. But if you're doing this with a friend, right?

### 🔖 セクション 60

Maybe you're both in a Facebook group, you're both in some Discord server, and you're both providing value to others. If somebody asks, "Yo, do you know anybody who's really good at Facebook ads or who could design a thumbnail for me or who could be a great video editor?" What is way more effective than you saying, "I am a great video editor or I am great at thumbnails is your friend recommends you." Now, use this effectively because this is brutally effective. But people really resonate with somebody else recommending. This is, you know, why word of mouth is the most powerful marketing method. If you are doing this with a friend, if both of you are cold DMing people and instead of you promoting yourself, you promote your friend's services and your friend promotes your own services, both of you are going to make a lot more money.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Also, on the topic of pricing, what you should do is not only should you sell annual plan, but you should offer personalized onboarding with the annual and the 2-year plan. So, you do annual at minimum, which let's say if you're charging $300 a month, annual could be $3,000, right? And suddenly we're talking high ticket. You include onboarding. Now, if you're not sure what that means, it simply means that you become their tech guy.

### 🚀 セクション 62

You help them set up the software. You explain how to use it. You walk them through everything. You get them to the website. You get them on a call.

### ⚡ セクション 63

You show them the setup. You explain to them the different features your product has. and you answer any questions they might have because when you're getting started and when your product is new, you cannot expect your customers to figure everything out. And of course, you cannot do personalized onboarding if people pay $10 a month. That's why you need to increase your prices.

### 🌟 セクション 64

You need to do annual plans and you need to include onboarding as an upsell. It's almost like adding consulting on top of your software. And it's very effective because you can start with a 60-minute onboarding call, which is at the beginning, and you can do a 30 minute follow-up call every single week to ensure that they're getting results, they know how to use it, and everything is good. And this makes your offer much higher perceived value with relatively low extra work on your part. So again, cold DMs are not scalable.

### 🎬 セクション 65

This is why you should use it to get your first 10 paying customers. So you're not going to cold DM your way into 10,000 customers. You're going to cold DM your way into your first 10 paying customers from which you need to get testimonials and reviews. Could be video, could be screenshots, could be uh images, could be just a written quote or multiple different media formats. And this makes scaling so much more easier because if you already have 10 testimonials from people just like you, then selling to your ideal target avatar is much easier because say, "Hey, look at all these people.

### 📋 セクション 66

They have the same problem. They look like you. They sound like you. They're in the same stage as you. I sold it to them.

### ⭐ セクション 67

Look at these five star reviews. They're all beyond happy. I can solve it to you, too. Now, again, the most important thing with the cold DM method is that you call DM the right people. And this means that you should be in communities where your ideal target avatar actually hangs out in.

### 📝 セクション 68

So, communities, where do you find these communities? Well, guess what? There is so many different sites. Example, Discord. Discord servers about your niche.

### 💡 セクション 69

Another example, Facebook groups. There are Facebook groups just about on every single topic. Another example is school school.com. You find free school communities. You join them and you start engaging.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Another example is subreddits. Basically anywhere that people hang out in groups online, you can join those communities. Telegram groups, that's another way. Telegram groups. Join these communities and start interacting.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Become one of the top contributors. Okay, you need to be doing at least nine value posts versus one selling post. So, nine value, one sell. And when you do the sell, you need to be very careful, right? Because some of these communities, they'll just ban you.

### 💭 セクション 72

They'll just instantly kick you if you're selling too overtly. You need to be subtle with it. You need to be careful. You need to read the community guidelines to not get banned. But if you don't do the value and you're just selling and you're just pitching, you're going to get banned really, really quickly.

### 📌 セクション 73

So again, the value posts is how you build your reputation and the trust in that community and you really need to become one of the most active and one of the most helpful contributors in these communities. So let's say you're developing like a B2B software for salesmen. Well, guess what? You can join Facebook groups, school communities about sales, you know, how to do high ticket sales. join them, interact with them, become friends with a lot of the top other contributors.

### ✅ セクション 74

And when people describe the problem that your software sells, you either call DM them personally or you mention it casually in the comments, not in a hard pitch way, but say, "I developed something that solves that. Feel free to check it out." You know, and people are not going to have an issue with that if you actually did these nine value posts. So over 90% maybe like 95% of your posts and comments should be pure value should be helping other members building your name and the remaining 5 to 10% should be soft selling and again I know this works because I did this back in the day with Facebook groups when I was selling creatives for drop shippers aka video creatives that they can run for Facebook ads. I was active in multiple different Facebook groups posting every single day, driving ton of value, helping people solve problems that were even unrelated to what I was selling. And because of this, you know, the admins like me, people like me, a lot of them people will DM you.

### 📚 セクション 75

They'll actually DM you for advice. And then when they're in the DMs, you can do way more aggressive selling because you don't have to worry about the admin seeing it, right? So, this really is effective. And yes, it does take time. But if you want to get your first 10 customers, this is a completely free way of doing that.

### 🔖 セクション 76

The third way of how you can get users for your AI software is with micro influencers. So, who are micro influencers? This is people with 500 to 20,000 followers in your niche. Now, the reason you want to target micro influencers is because they have no clue how to price their promotions. A lot of them will even work for free.

### 🎨 セクション 77

This creates an insane arbitrage opportunity. People at this scale between 500 and 20,000 followers have no idea how to price their brand deals. They have no idea what's a good offer because simply they don't get many offers. Right? If people are below 2,000 followers, it's very likely that you might be the first person that reached out to them to promote your product.

### 🚀 セクション 78

So these people have no clue what their pricing should be and they have no clue what they should charge and they have no other options which means you can get a really really good deal. Just to give you a story of what I did at Vectal to grow it with micro influencers because again I actually did these things. I found a guy who was in a similar niche as me. I won't name his name but he was getting more views per video than me. So this was a guy on YouTube who was averaging more views than me at that time.

### ⚡ セクション 79

But because he had less subscribers and less experience with brand deals, he was charging seven times less. That's right. This guy was charging seven times less for sponsored videos than me even though he was getting more views. And this is the power of micro influencers. The arbitrage here is just crazy because you're not competing with billionaire companies, right?

### 🌟 セクション 80

When you run Facebook ads, when you do paid ads, Google Adwords, whatever it is, you're paying for the same clicks as McDonald's, as Coca-Cola, as multi-billion dollar companies with infinite marketing budgets, which is a losing strategy. But these companies are not doing micro influencers because it's a simply waste of time. If you have a billion dollar company, you might need to spend $300,000 per day on marketing, which you cannot do with micro influencers, right? You need to work with people like Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, massive influencers who charge millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars for brand deals. So you are not competing with massive companies for micro influencers.

### 🎬 セクション 81

You're usually competing with nobody because they have no other options, right? Which is what allows us to get these insane deals, these insane arbitrage opportunities that other people simply do not see. And again, the more niche you go, the better. This is why it's so essential to have a clear target avatar, a clear ICP, a clear idea of who you're selling to. You don't want to market to everybody.

### 📋 セクション 82

You don't want to build something that appeals to billion users because then it's just not going to appeal to anybody, right? You need to build something that solves a very specific, a very painful problem for a clear target avatar in a small niche that's easy to find online. Anything I'm explaining in this video will be much, much easier if you do this step. If you don't do this step and if you're like, "Oh, no, David. The software I'm building could really be useful for everybody.

### ⭐ セクション 83

I'm building a general AI agent that will save you 10 hours per week and anybody can use it." Well, tough luck. You're going to have a very hard time marketing and very hard time getting your first 100 users. But if you humble yourself and you go after a small niche and you try to first monopolize that niche and really dominate that before expanding, you will have a much easier time getting the first 100 users. Because in a small niche, you can find micro influencers. If you don't have a niche, who do you even work with?

### 📝 セクション 84

Right? There's no answer to that. Now, when you're talking about people who are like, you know, 10, 20,000 followers, they're probably going to want some money, right? Because these guys are starting to get some options. They understand that their following has value.

### 💡 セクション 85

If you want to work for free, though, you probably should go between 500 and 5,000 followers. But you can absolutely do this for free. But in order for these micro influencers to promote your software for free, you need to give them something. And usually that is an affiliate offer. So what this means is that you offer them maybe 30% to let's say 50% of the revenue that they bring in.

### 🔧 セクション 86

So every customer that comes in, if that customer makes you $100, you give them between 30 and $50 per customer. Plus, to make the deal even sweeter, you give those micro influencers lifetime access. So they don't actually have to pay for the software themselves. And again, a lot of people at this scale, they don't have any of their own products. They don't have nothing to sell.

### 🎯 セクション 87

So if you give them a great affiliate offer, lifetime access, you personally onboard them, the product is relevant to them, they'll happily promote it for you and, you know, they'll start making money themselves and you get to keep more than half of the money for outsourcing the marketing to somebody else. And another bonus is that if you pick the right person, that micro influencer can over time grow to become a proper large influencer. And if he makes a video that gets 10,000, 100,000, million views and it has a affiliate offer for your own software, then you're going to have a very nice inflow of customers. Now, if you do have some money to spend and you don't want to do this free method because, you know, most people are going to reject an affiliate offer, what you want to do is bulk deals. And this really is the secret of working with micro influencers.

### 💭 セクション 88

So, let's say you find a guy who's charging $500 per post or per sponsored video. You would think that for four videos, you would have to pay him $2,000. But this is false. These guys, these micro influencers, what they value above anything else is stability. They want predictable income.

### 📌 セクション 89

These guys, they're not usually entrepreneurs. They don't have that risk-taking business owner mindset. A lot of them still have a full-time job. A lot of them still have the employee mindset. So, what they want is predictable income.

### ✅ セクション 90

And you give it to them with a bulk deal. So, instead of paying $2,000 for four videos, you discount this by 50 to 60%. So, you offer 50 to 60% less in exchange for doing a bulk deal of four or five videos, which means that instead of paying $2,000, you'll pay between $800 and $1,000 with the same influencer with the same following. And the beauty of this is that instead of doing a single video, which can flop, right? It happens on YouTube.

### 📚 セクション 91

Sometimes videos get low views. If they do five videos or four or five videos, the likelihood that all of them flopping is much much lower, which means that you will very likely make your money back. So again, if you already have some capital and you don't mind spending money to grow faster with your marketing, bulk deals with micro influencers are amazing and we use them plenty at Vectal to get paying customers. Another benefit of this marketing method is that these people are usually your perfect testers, right? If you do a good job of specifying your niche, these people will usually be your ideal target avatar, which means they make the perfect product testers.

### 🔖 セクション 92

So instead of spending valuable time and money hiring QA testers, which in the beginning you shouldn't do, get a few free users, get a few micro influencers, and these will spot any bugs you might have, any suggestions, you know, they'll tell you what features are missing. They'll do all the testing for you, plus they'll promote the product for you as well. Now, to really maximize the effectiveness of this strategy of micro influencers, you want to work with more than one person. Ideally, five to 10 different micro influencers because these people usually aren't consistent. They usually don't have good work ethic.

### 🎨 セクション 93

They usually don't have a stable posting schedule. So, likelihood is that some people will just stop posting. Some of them will quit social media. Some of them will just switch up their formats and start getting zero views. It is what it is.

### 🚀 セクション 94

If you work with five to 10 different people though, you protect yourself against the randomness of these micro influencers. And out of these 10 people, maybe two or three will be actually competent who will grow to become larger influencers. And if you build great relationships with them, you just have a very nice way of getting customers for the years to come. So work with five to 10 at least. And again, takes time reaching out to them.

### ⚡ セクション 95

You know, you have to email them, you have to DM them on Twitter. It takes time to build a roster of five to 10 influencers, but it's absolutely worth it. And when you get a great testimonial from one of them, it goes to the top of your landing page. This is very important because your other customers, they're likely going to know these people, especially if you're targeting your niche properly. So, when you get a nice testimonial from an influencer, you put it at the top of your landing page and you use it in your advertising.

### 🌟 セクション 96

You you use it as much as you can. Okay? top of landing page. So maybe you know if your landing page is like this long then at the top you should have a small banner of saying like Stephanie XY Z said this product is great and it helped her save you know 10 hours a week and she's a happy paying customer and then you put has 15,000 subscribers on YouTube. So when people visit your landing page like wow this famous person in this industry like the product and it's basically like a review on steroids is a way to think about it.

### 🎬 セクション 97

Another thing you can do with these guys if you're struggling um to get them posted, you write the script for them, right? So, you help them make the videos and it never hurts to do a little handholding, right? It's extra perceived value. You basically part-time work for them in order to use their audience, which again, at the beginning, you don't have if you don't have any users, you should have the time to put in the work and to help these influencers make the videos easier, give them video ideas, just help them to make the process. You need to oil the whole process so that they're making more videos and you make it as easy as possible for them to promote your product.

### 📋 セクション 98

So do some work for them for free. And I know the words for free, some of you don't like to hear it, but hey, if you want to enter business, you have to be willing to work for free. You cannot compare it to McDonald's wages. That is completely stupid mindset. Not every hour in your early days of being a founder and business owner is going to be paying off, right?

### ⭐ セクション 99

In fact, the first six months of your entrepreneurial journey, you're going to be doing a lot of free work. But if you really believe in your idea, if you really want to become someone who's financially independent, who has time freedom, who can travel the world, who can work from his laptop, this is what it takes. You have to be willing to get your hands dirty and do some free work. And soon enough, if you're actually consistent and if you're doing your best, you won't have to be able to rank free work. You will have influencers promoting your product and you will have a software that is scaling by itself.

### 📝 セクション 100

Also, to get more success with micro influencers, hold them accountable. This doesn't mean, you know, being annoying and yelling at them, nothing like that. You simply check in daily like, "Hey, Stephen, how's it going? You know, you plan on making a video today?" "Oh, cool, cool. So, anything I can do to help?

### 💡 セクション 101

Yeah. All right. You're going to lunch. Okay. Yeah.

### 🔧 セクション 102

We can call after lunch. Just hold them accountable. Right. Again, people at this scale, they're not serious. They're not experienced content creators.

### 🎯 セクション 103

They don't have any posting schedule. They're kind of doing as a hobby. They're doing it randomly. So, you need to be their accountability buddy. You need to, you know, hold them accountable.

### 💭 セクション 104

You need to set the standard like, okay, you you mentioned you want to post three times a week. You know, it's already Wednesday and you haven't posted your first video. Let's get started on it. Do you have any ideas? Like, be polite.

### 📌 セクション 105

Check up with them frequently. Again, make it as easy as possible for them to promote your product. And by the way, if you do a good job with micro influencers, you will have all of the skills to then switch to working with macro influencers, which is just fancy word for large influencers, right? So, this is anybody with like 50k plus, say, again, depends on the industry. In the fitness space, people with 50,000 are still small.

### ✅ セクション 106

In some like B2B size recruiting, people of 50,000 are probably one of the biggest in that niche. But if you master micro influencers and working with them, micro influencers, everything is going to be easier and more scalable, right? But it's going to be more expensive. Which is why I started with teaching you micro influencers because this video is all about how to get your first 100 customers for as little money and time as possible, ideally for free. So now you know three of the four methods but now let me teach you about SEO which you can leverage AI to do it for you.

### 📚 セクション 107

So method number four is S EO which stands for search engine optimization. Now the cool thing about SEO is that thanks to large language models you can leverage AI to help you write SEO articles for you. So what SEO means is that you optimize your website to get clicks from search engine. And this could be either humans themselves or AI agents browsing the web and clicking on your website as one of the sources. Now, when you write articles optimized for search results, you don't want to use GPD models.

### 🔖 セクション 108

Instead, you want to use cloth or Gemini models. And that's because claw models are usually way more creative. They have a unique writing style. While GPD models like CH GBD 5.2 or other models in Chad GPD, people are more used to them. They know what the GPT format looks like.

### 🎨 セクション 109

And that's why you don't want to use GPT and you want to use cloth. So don't use GPT. Do use cloth. And again, ideally you use Opus 4.5 or whatever is the best cloth model when you're watching this video. Now with SEO, you want to target problem keywords and not product keywords.

### 🚀 セクション 110

So instead of saying best editing software, you want to say how to remove background from video. So, target problem search terms. So, if you built a software that creates amazing logos for businesses, maybe you would say like how to choose a converting logo or logo not scalable. Whatever problem is relevant to your software, use AI, you can use clot as well to brainstorm relevant problems and then you write an article for each problem. So, onepage article is about problem one.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Second article is going to be about problem two. Third article is problem three and so on. And again, the beauty of SEO of this method is that you can leverage AI to help you write these articles. Now, I would recommend not having every word written by AI. Write at least 50 to 80% of the words yourself manually because people again are getting used to AI, especially GPD models.

### 🌟 セクション 112

But even if you use cloth, you still want to enter some of your own wording style because it just makes the article better. It makes it more human, more authentic. So don't have 100% of it written by AI. But obviously leverage AI to help you out. And also you should take each of these different problems and turn them into separate landing pages, right?

### 🎬 セクション 113

So on these landing pages, people should be able to purchase your product and use it. But each of these landing pages targets a different reason why they might want to use your product. So let's say it's some fitness app, right? Well, guess what? Some people want to lose weight.

### 📋 セクション 114

Some people want to gain muscle. Some people want to help be consistent. Each of those are different problems. And each of these should be a separate landing page with hyperspecific copyrightiting just for that problem. And another bonus of this is by the way when you find one of them that converts much better than the others, you know that you should double down on this problem specifically and you should go very hard on making your product solve this problem.

### ⭐ セクション 115

Great. You should target influencers that have this problem. You know what you should be building your features about. So that's why you should do this. That's why you should separate landing pages for each of the problems because it also helps you niche down even more and increase your profit margins that much greater.

### 📝 セクション 116

What you can also do is build comparison pages. So let's say you're building the cursor but for video editing, right? Some video editing software that leverages AI agents. What you would do is say like Adobe Premiere versus Da Vinci versus Cap Cut versus your own software. So when people search that up, they would see three established names and your name.

### 💡 セクション 117

And guess what? A lot of those people get curious about what is this software? I didn't hear about it before. They click about it and it's like, okay, looks interesting. Leverages AI.

### 🔧 セクション 118

And guess what? Some of those people will become your customers. So X versus Y versus Z versus your product. And if you are clever, you will do this for each problem. So how these softwares compare at video editing, at rendering speeds, at quality, at large files, you can do this comparison pages literally for everything.

### 🎯 セクション 119

You just rinse and repeat with the problems chat, right? So the more problems you can find, the more pages you can create. And again, if you are struggling to figure out the problems, put your target avatar, put your product, put all the context into cloth, into Opus 4.5 and ask it, "What are some problems with software in this niche? Help me brainstorm different SEO articles. Leverage AI." A lot of you guys think you're using AI.

### 💭 セクション 120

You might have Chad GBT. You might be using Gemini, but a lot of you are only scratching the surface. If you are using the free plans of these AI tools, you're not even a serious individual. But even if you have the paid plan of JGBT or paid plan of CL, you're probably not using the AI as much as you should, right? You might be using it to build your software, to do the coding, but guess what?

### 📌 セクション 121

Everybody's doing that by now. So, you need to get creative. You need to be using it for esoteric use cases, for the things that are actual problems in your business that others simply do not realize yet. And basically the mindset for success with SEO is that you want to target questions that your target avatar is very likely googling. Also don't sleep on YouTube SEO.

### ✅ セクション 122

What this means is that some of the content you create in the first method organic marketing should be optimized for YouTube search results. So not everything should be optimized for virality and for recommendation. Some of the things should be just like how to use XY Z or which software is best for Y problem. That is YouTube SEO. Things that people actually search up on YouTube.

### 📚 セクション 123

You can combine this strategy with the first strategy and get even better results. Now, the beauty of SEO is that it compounds over time. As you write more articles, as you solve more problems, as you get better at copyrightiting, your website will get more and more traffic and you will build an asset that brings users by itself over the years. So SEO is actually a lot more scalable than cold DMs, but it is takes some time to get started, right? With cold DMs, you can get your first paying customer today.

### 🔖 セクション 124

You can start DMing people today. SEO is more of a long-term thing and it's more compounding than cold DMs. So those were the four methods of how to get your first 100 users. And if you like this style of brutally honest, nononsense practical videos and if you want to work with me oneonone, then click the link below the video because I'm going to be working with a select few startup founders to help them scale their AI software company. So if you are serious about AI and if you are building an AI SAS, fill out the form below the video.
