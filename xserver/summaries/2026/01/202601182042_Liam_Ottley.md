## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Hey guys. So, in today's video, we're covering the different ways to actually make money from home using AI in 2026. There are thousands of ways to make money with AI right now, but I've sorted through them all and come up with my own list based on my own experience of building AI businesses for the past 3 years and what's actually working for real people inside my communities. Everything we're talking about is tried and true, and I'm going to be showing you the real tools, the real platforms, and exactly how you can do each one of these yourself. Honestly, you need to know what the latest stuff is right now because there are so many new models and tools coming out that the opportunities today look completely different than what they did even 6 months ago.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, let's get into number one. So, the first method is what I call the instant website flipper. Here's the idea. Your local dentist, local plumber, local accountant. Their website probably looks like a fossil from 2005.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They know it, you know it, the customers know it, and they also know that a web design agency is going to charge them $10,000 and take 3 months just to fix it. But you can now do it with AI in just about 2 minutes. Okay, so to start off with flipping these websites, you're going to want to head to orura.build. No affiliation with this tool, but it's a really, really good platform for rapidly creating beautiful websites with AI. Now, to show you an example, I found some random dentist business near me in Oakuckland.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, the way to do this is you need to take their information off the website somehow. You can either kind of copy everything or the better way is to actually rightclick and go to view page source. Going to copy all of this page source. We're going to head back to Aura here and then we're going to go to the template section. And here we actually have a dental template that we can use.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So we can click on this. Take a look at it. Looks great. I'm going to go use for free here. Then I'm going to remix the full template.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Then we just need a quick prompt saying that we want to redo the website. Here's the source code and here's some tips and tricks on what we want you to do with it. So remember that I pasted in all of the source code that we got from uh the website over here. So I've added that into the prompt and now it's going to rebuild us the website using all the information but in that template style. And then just like that, we have a website that looks far better than the previous one.

### 🎯 応用例

And it's even got all the pictures of their team here from the website. It's got the services they have, their assessment, and their logo as well. And with the old one and the new one side by side here, I think you can agree just how much better and more modern this looks in just a few minutes. So now you've got this beautiful finished website. You're going to walk into their office.

### 💭 考察

Then you're going to show it to them on their laptop and say, "This is your new website. You can start selling these at $500. Get a bit better, charge a,000 or 2,000. You do two or three of these a week and you're already hitting $10,000 a month. And from there, you can upsell them on other stuff like the other methods that I'm about to share with you in this video.

### 📌 まとめ

All right, let's get into number two. Method two is my personal favorite and it's probably the easiest way to get started if you're not technical at all. You don't know how to code or you've never had any exposure to that sort of stuff before. It's called an AI tools audit. And here is the problem that you're solving.

### ✅ 結論

Every small business owner right now knows that they need to be using AI. They're seeing the headlines, their competitors talking about it, but they have absolutely no idea what tools to use because there's thousands of AI tools out there and they don't have the time to research them all and figure out which one works for them. They're paralyzed, but they know they need to do something. And you can become the person who tells them exactly what to do when it comes to AI tools. So, the way this works is simple.

### 📚 追加情報

You sit down with a business owner. You ask them about their biggest bottlenecks, their most annoying tasks, and the stuff that really eats up a lot of their time and their team's time. Then, you go away and you find three to five AI tools that solve those exact problems. You put it into a simple report for them. You hand it over and you get paid.

### 🔖 補足

That is it. You're not building anything and you're not coding anything either. You're just selling AI clarity to these small businesses. I've got this tool here which is called there's an AI for that which is going to give you everything you need as a complete beginner to find tools that solve problems for businesses. So say for example you do an audit and they say hey we've got a real problem with invoicing.

### 🎨 セクション 13

We're spending so much time in our finance department tracking down our invoices going into all the emails and bouncing around and trying to get the right invoices so that we can reconcile our transactions. So, you can come in here and click search and go invoices. And here we have the invoices task. We can scroll down and there's all of these different AI tools that we can use or try out or investigate for them to see if it's a good fit for their workflow. Um, so here's one called get invoice.

### 🚀 セクション 14

We can look at that AI powered invoice extraction 10 times faster. We can click on their website here. Check it out. AI accounting automation that saves you hundreds of hours. So, just by looking at it, it looks like you can add in all of your Gmail accounts and then it can go and do the emailing for you to get the invoices sent in order to reconcile those transactions.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And that's just one simple example. If you go to tasks here, you can see all of the different categories, productivity, software, text, images, marketing. You literally just need to know how to search and how to put together a simple report. And you can start charging $200, $500 for these just starting out. It takes a couple of days for you to deliver when you're just starting out.

### 🌟 セクション 16

But as you get better, you can raise your prices to $1,000, $2,000, $5,000. At my agency, Morningside, we've done these kinds of AI audits for 4 weeks for $60,000 for a 200 person company. And here's the thing, the data from my community shows that the average time to land your first client with this method is just 9 days when you're using the right type of outreach method to get those clients. And because I think this is such an incredible opportunity for beginners to get into AI in 2026, I've just released a full free course on exactly how to do one of these audits. the outreach templates to get your client in 9 days, the audit structure, the video that explains this model and how to get into it will be in the first link of description.

### 🎬 セクション 17

But let's keep moving. All right, so method three is where things get really fun. We know that brands need visuals. They need product photos and social content and video ads, UGC style clips. They need this stuff constantly and traditionally this stuff is very expensive and slow for them to get.

### 📋 セクション 18

A proper agency will cost thousands of dollars and it will take weeks to organize. You need to get cameras and actors and locations, a whole crew just to get these photos of products. And now one person with a laptop and the right set of prompts can do all of it. And I'm talking product photos that look like they came from a professional shoot. UC style ads without any real actors and cinematic shots without a camera.

### ⭐ セクション 19

My go-to platform at the moment for me and my content team is Invido, who are also the sponsor of this video. So shout out to the team there. But I'm more than happy to be showing you guys the exact tool that I'm using in my creative team right now. So video you can get there. The link will be in the description to sign up.

### 📝 セクション 20

And you can either sign up to create an account or you can log in if you already have one. And once inside, you'll see this input where you can add in a prompt. This will trigger Nvidia's video agent, which is going to make a bunch of creative decisions for us under the hood and is capable of generating complex longer videos for us. For now, since we want to keep things short and sweet, let's head to the agent and models tab. So, I came on here earlier and just grabbed a mug.

### 💡 セクション 21

I took a photo of my mug and then I put it into Invido and I was able to generate all these different types of content in just a few minutes. Starting with some product photos that would be suitable for e-commerce. You can see you can put them with literally just a simple prompt like this. You can get crazy kind of Black Friday ads like this using some of their trending formats which you can do by just coming into here clicking on trends. I also did some really luxury style ads like this.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Just a bit of footage and you can even generate UGC clips like this. >> This Lac Cruzette mug is genuinely the best. Still perfectly hot. I use it every single day. >> Now, these are obviously quite quick and dirty, but it shows you in just a few minutes what I've been able to generate uh with just a few very basic prompts.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, if you make this your platform and you really spend time learning how to use all the features, learn which models are best for what, you can literally become a one person AI creative studio using a tool like this. And if you're serious about it, you can invest in a generative account, which is $100 a month. So, generating those literally took me a few minutes. But you can see how if you really lean into and learn a tool like Invido, you can become essentially a oneperson creative studio and have a handful of clients that you help with those kind of creative needs. Now, to get this off the ground, you're going to approach small businesses and offer them a simple monthly package, something like $2,000 a month, which will get them 150 images and 10 videos, and you're basically just going to be on standby.

### 💭 セクション 24

They're going to send their requests, and you'll deliver them the creatives that they need fast. Once you stack a few of these clients, you're at 10K per month pretty quickly. All right, getting into method number four. So, method number four is one of the fastest growing opportunities that I'm seeing right now, and it's writing the enormous AI agents weight. Now, think about how many times you pulled a business and nobody picked up or you got put on hold forever or you just had a simple question and couldn't get an answer.

### 📌 セクション 25

And this kind of stuff happens constantly and every time it does, that business is losing money because you're going to end up going to their competitor. So, you can solve this by building them an AI phone line that answers customer questions 24/7. We're going to go on to my go-to platform for this at the moment, which is 11 Labs. You can log in. They do have a free plan.

### ✅ セクション 26

Literally 2 minutes, we're going to be able to build an AI voice agent that does customer support for our friends at Parnell Dentistry. Again, no uh affiliation with them. They're just a a target that we're going for this time. So, a new agent here. We can go to a business agent, healthcare and medical.

### 📚 セクション 27

Then, we're going to make it a customer support. We're going to call this PA now dentistry support agent. We can put in Paral Dentistry. Pop them in there. All right.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, if you want to set this up super quick, you just need to put a really good prompt in here just to give it an idea of the main goal. So, you're a customer support representative for Panau Dentistry. You answer questions about the company's service, location, team, etc. from the knowledge base you have been provided with cuz we're going to give it a knowledge base in a sec. If people ask about booking or pricing, you redirect them to the website at the link here.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, we can create the agent. 11 Labs going to do most of the work for us thankfully. And there we go. 11 Labs has written out our prompt for us here. Now, we can just go to knowledge base.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Now, off camera, I just went on to pine choose websites. I copied a bunch of the pages and then I pasted into chat GBT. Asked it to write me a knowledgebased document with all the key information that an agent would need to know. Then I can just copy this, add a document, create text, paste it in there. Then we can go back to our agent.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Make sure that the prompt is mentioning the knowledge base. You have access to a knowledge base about Pyon Dentistry. Your primary goal is to answer questions. If customers inquire about bookings or pricing, send them to here. And we can add a nice conversational first message here.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Then we can configure the voice. I'm going to try to find a New Zealand. We've got our John here. Great LLM provider. We can just keep it as Gemini 2.5 Flash and then we're ready to give this a spin.

### 🎬 セクション 33

>> Hi, welcome to Parnell Dentistry. This is Mike speaking. How can I help today? >> Hey Mike. Um, I was just wondering uh what your mission is at Parnell Dentistry.

### 📋 セクション 34

>> Hello. Our mission at Parnell Dentistry is to prioritize our patients oral health with compassion. We aim to deliver a pleasant and stressfree journey. >> Okay. Yeah.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Yeah, mate. That sounds great. Now, I really want to know who's on your team. Give me one of the dentists on your team. >> Certainly.

### 📝 セクション 36

One of the dentists on our team is Dr. Cavendra and I do. We have a wonderful team of fully qualified. >> Excellent. Appreciate it, mate.

### 💡 セクション 37

So, we just built a working AI customer support line in about a minute. But to turn this into a business that you can make money from consistently, you need to find some local businesses, build them a quick demo using their actual information like I just did there, and then you walk in and let them talk to it. Let them ask questions about their own businesses and watch their faces as they realize what's possible. And this kind of stuff is just the starting point really. Once you understand the basics, you can move into much more advanced AI voice agents that can book appointments over the phone, which allows you to charge thousands of dollars to build up front and then hundreds or thousands of dollars or more per month for every single client in order to manage and improve that system for them.

### 🔧 セクション 38

If this stuff seems interesting to you and you want to learn more about this path into essentially learning how to build with AI, that same full course on starting AI business, which I mentioned before, is going to be linked below. That's going to explain the whole model to you so you can get into it. So, I highly recommend you check that out after this. Now, method 5 might sound basic, but do not sleep on it because companies are spending thousands of dollars on AI tools like Chachi Bet and Claude and all the other ones, but their teens are still using them to do really basic stuff like writing birthday messages or drafting emails. And it's a massive waste of these tools.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And these businesses are desperate for someone to be able to teach their people how to actually use and get value out of the stuff. And I know firsthand that this stuff works because it's one of the things we sell at my agency, Morning Side AI. But if you're looking to get into it yourself, here's the plan. What you need to do is first and foremost reach out to people that you already know like your old bosses, your former colleagues, friends who run businesses, and offer to do a free workshop in exchange for a testimonial. Then you're going to walk in, teach them the basics, and then blow their minds by taking one of their actual repetitive tasks and showing them how to do it much faster with AI right there in front of them.

### 💭 セクション 40

And as you may have noticed, there's a bit of a pattern here of showing rather than telling when it comes to communicating the value of your AI services. So that free workshop that you do is essentially a Trojan horse. And once you've proven your value with it, the companies inevitably want more help from you. Like one guy from my community, Matteo, who's made over $400,000 with this exact model because 70% of the companies that he does these basic training workshops for become clients for much bigger projects later on. You can start with free workshops to build testimonials, then go on to selling $500 to $1,000 sessions.

### 📌 セクション 41

Then you can do half-day intensives for $2 to $5,000, and you land a few recurring clients in there, and you're easily at 10K per month. So there you go. five real ways to make money from home with AI in 2026. But if I had to recommend one for most people, it would be the AI tools audit. Like I said, it's the easiest to start.

### ✅ セクション 42

You don't need any technical skills, and the demand for it is just insane right now. And like I said, I believe in this so much that I released a full guide on YouTube breaking down exactly how to start an AI business from scratch that's based on this AI tools method. Plus, I created an entire free course that comes with it to give you everything you need like the templates, the outreach scripts, and a full step-by-step process to deliver your first AI tools audit. So, you can watch that up here. Highly recommend it, guys.

### 📚 セクション 43

Or it's going to be in the first thing in the description. If you can't click there, this is the opportunity, guys. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one.
