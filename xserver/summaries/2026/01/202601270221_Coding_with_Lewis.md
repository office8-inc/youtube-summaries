### 🎬 導入

The creator of Linux is vibe coding in the internet doesn't know how to feel about it. This tweet went viral showing a commit message from Linus Torvault talking about how Google anti-gravity the VS code fork that they made [music] fixed his visualization tool. Is this much better than I could do by hand? Sure is. And the reception of course is mixed.

### 📋 背景・概要

But the tweet is actually a little bit misleading. This commit message isn't being pushed to the Linux repository. It's [music] actually a personal project that L has created for himself. And the vioded part was a Python visualizer tool. AI is fantastic at writing code [music] and let's be real here, it can code better than most of us.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

But the use case here is actually a perfect representation of when vibe coding is [music] at its best, replacing the middleman between your code editor and the copy and pasting of code that you see on forums, etc. Linus isn't replacing himself with AI. He's not wasting time on throwaway code. And honestly, neither should you. What's your thoughts?

### 📝 詳細説明

Let me know. Fall for more.
