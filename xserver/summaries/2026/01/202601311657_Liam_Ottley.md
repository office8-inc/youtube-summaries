What's the best AI business model to start in 2026? As someone who's been building AI businesses for the past three years and has seen thousands of people start their own inside my communities, I'm going to break down the 11 AI business models that are actually working right now. And these aren't theories. These are proven by real people who've used these exact models to quit their jobs and become a full-time AI entrepreneur. I'm going to show you how much each one costs to start, how easy they are to learn, and the realistic earning potential of each as well, so you can pick the perfect one for you.

### 📋 背景・概要

Let's get into it. the AI filmmaker. With the rise of the insane AI video generation models like V3 and Sora 2, an entirely new opportunity has exploded for AI filmmakers. It's just you, a laptop, and some well-crafted prompts. And you're creating cinematic ads, short films, and branded content that used to require entire production crews.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And the value here is that you're delivering production quality video to businesses in days instead of months at a fraction of the cost. In 2025, we saw the first entirely AI generated ad play at the NBA finals. And we have guys like PJ Ace who did that going fulltime into AI film making and landing contracts with companies like David Beckham's new supplement company. So this space is booming and it's wide open to anyone right now with a laptop and some props. The cost to start this one is low.

### 📝 詳細説明

The effort is medium and the earning potential is medium to high. Number two is the AI consultant. The AI consultant is the perfect entry point if you don't want to actually build anything. You instead sell what I call an AI tools audit which is where you interview a business for an hour or so. You identify the biggest bottlenecks and time wasters.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Then you deliver them a simple report that recommends three to five AI tools that solve those problems. So the value here is that you are selling businesses clarity because right now small businesses in particular are completely paralyzed by these thousands of AI tools and options they have and they'll pay someone to just come in identify what's wrong and tell them what to use. So the cost to start this one is low, the effort to start it is low and the earning potential is low to medium. But these AI tools audits are really just your foot in the door to much bigger deals and things that you can sell them. I've actually just released a full free course on exactly how to do these AI tools audits in my school community.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

There are people who are landing their first clients in literally days using the methods I share in there. So, the link to join that will be the first one in the description. Number three, the AI freelancer. The AI freelancer is the entry point for people who want to take the building route where you can learn a high value skill like no code AI automation with tools like make.com or n or go into vibe coding with tools like bolt or lovable and you build AI agents and automations and custom internal software for your clients. One of the easiest ways to start out and actually find clients to work with is on platforms like Upwork or in communities like my own or through your existing network as well.

### 🎯 応用例

And the value here is that businesses need AI stuff built, but they don't have the time to learn the tools themselves. So, you're trading your new skills for cash while getting paid to learn on their business as well. So, the cost to start this is low. The effort to actually get it going is medium, and the earning potential is low to medium. This path of learning to build is also covered in the free course that I've just released.

### 💭 考察

So, if you love to tinker and build, you want to learn AI agents, automations, and vibe coding, then that first link in the description will show you how. Number four, the AI automation agency. Both the consultant and the freelancer pathway actually lead down to this AI automation agency model, which is where you stop doing all the work yourself and you start to build a real business out of it. So, you've got clients coming in, you've got systems who deliver the thing to them, and now you're [music] hiring other people to do the delivering for you. So, you're the one actually finding opportunities and closing the deals while your team handles the building.

### 📌 まとめ

This is exactly what I did when I started my agency, Morning Side.AI, AI back in early 2023. Cost to start one of these is low, the effort is medium, and the earning potential is medium to high. Next, we have the AI creative studio. The AI creative studio is the AI filmmaker model turned into a production machine using the agency model that we just covered. So, it's pretty much the same setup.

### ✅ 結論

It's you, a laptop, and the right tools and a good set of prompts to get the most out of these image and video generation tools, but now you're pumping out high volumes of creative assets on a retainer for your clients. So, that could be social media ads, any marketing content that brands need. [music] And the value here again is that you can deliver in days what traditional agencies will take weeks to produce [music] and one person can handle multiple clients at once. The cost to start this is low. The effort to get it going is medium and the earning potential is also medium.

### 📚 追加情報

The AI content creator. The AI content creator model is where you build a personal brand talking about AI whether that's on LinkedIn or Twitter or YouTube and then you can monetize that audience and the views you get through sponsorships, affiliates and eventually their own products if you want to go down that route as well. The value you provide is education and sometimes entertainment as well. But the catch is that the grind is real and you're going to need to be creating constantly. And because most of your money is going to come from sponsorships, it can take quite a while to show up and most people give up before it actually starts to kick in and you really start making money from your sponsored videos.

### 🔖 補足

Cost to start this is medium considering the camera equipment and editing you need to do. The effort is high and the earning potential is low at first, but the ceiling is massive if you do stick with it and get through those early phases. The AI influencer. Unlike the previous model, this is not creating your own personal brand. This is creating [music] a fictional AI character and building an audience around them.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So you can think of those Bigfoot vlogs if you saw them or one that I've seen is Ja monkey, this rustifarian monkey [music] riding around. People running these accounts are using AI tools to batch produce content and they let the characters do the work. So once you posted enough and you've built up an audience through funny clips or insightful clips, you can monetize these views through sponsorships and brand deals where companies will pay your fake person or character to hold their product or give a shout out. So this one definitely seems the craziest, but it is something people are doing right now and it is exploding. So the cost to start this is low.

### 🚀 セクション 14

But the effort to get it off the ground is medium and the earning potential because it's mainly based on sponsorships is low to medium. Consumer AI educator. For this model, you find a specific audience with a specific AI problem or a knowledge gap and you teach them how to solve it. For example, there are tons of parents that are stressed right now about their kid falling behind and learning AI and not being prepared for the new career landscape. You can create a course on how to prepare your child for the AI future.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Then you use content on social media to attract the right people writing about these kinds of topics. Then you can run free workshops to convert these into a free customer and then you can use courses to monetize. Everyone needs clarity around AI right now and there are thousands of pockets of people willing to pay for it. The cost to start this one is low, the effort is medium and the earning potential is also medium. Next is the AI business educator.

### 🌟 セクション 16

This is the same concept but a bigger buyer. So the business AI educator trains companies teams on AI tools. They run workshops. They create internal training programs. They upskill entire departments.

### 🎬 セクション 17

The value here is that companies have budgets for training and they are desperate to get more out of AI. They've bought all these AI tools and their teams are still using chatbt to write birthday messages or draft emails. And when done right, this kind of training is your foot in the door to more work with that company. My agency, Morningside.AI, uses basic business education as an entry point so that we can sell other services like our AI consulting and AI development. The cost to start this one is low.

### 📋 セクション 18

The effort required is medium and the earning potential is medium to high because these businesses have deep pockets. The AI SAS builder. This is where you build software products instead of serving clients directly like an agency or a freelancer. There are two flavors of the AI SAS builder. The first being using AI coding tools to build a traditional SAS but much faster.

### ⭐ セクション 19

The second is using AI coding tools to make an actually AI powered software [music] where AI is the product or an AI SAS. The dream here is a recurring revenue business that scales. But the reality is that you need to build up some decent AI coding skills or vibe coding skills or have a big cash stockpile or runway to pay developers to work on your product until it finally takes off. Your first version of the product will absolutely suck. And marketing a bad product is brutal and most people [music] quit or run out of money before the product actually clicks.

### 📝 セクション 20

So this is not great for beginners. The cost to start is high. The effort is high and the earning potential is medium to high if it works. Finally, the AI transformation partner. This is the top of the mountain in terms of AI business models right now.

### 💡 セクション 21

And it's where you are a company's go-to for everything AI education, AI auditing, their AI development, and their ongoing support and partnership. This means six figure contracts and multi-year relationships. And this is exactly what Morningside AI has grown into. But the catch is that you can't start here. You need to build up to it slowly through the other paths like AI consulting to AI automation agency and then to your AI transformation partner.

### 🔧 セクション 22

But once you are up here, the ceiling is massive. The cost to start one of these is medium. There's a lot of work involved. The effort is high, but the earning potential is also high. So there's your map.

### 🎯 セクション 23

11 AI business models all ranked. And if you want to start one of the two most proven paths, the AI consultant or the AI freelancer that lead directly into starting your own AI agency, I have a full free course here on YouTube that breaks down exactly how to succeed and get into both, no matter what your background, if you're technical, if you can code, if you want to code or not. So, if you're even remotely interested in starting AI business in 2026, I highly recommend you check this one out. That's all for the video, guys. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next
