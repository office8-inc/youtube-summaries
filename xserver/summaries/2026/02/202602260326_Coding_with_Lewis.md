## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This is the strangest repository I've ever seen. It's called No Code. And it's a repository of, can you guess it? No Code. Yeah.

### 📋 背景・概要

It boils down to five files. A readme, a license style MD, and a Docker file with one little line of code in it. Now, it's a funny joke, you know, haha. But the funniest thing about it is that it has 65,000 stars on GitHub with over 5,000 forks. And if you look at the pull request, you actually get some really funny things that people are saying like add Korean not support adding a aentic workflow cuz everything has to be agentic nowadays.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Add MCP support. Why is there nine comments on it? Okay, details. Nice details. Rewritten in Rust.

### 📝 詳細説明

Yeah, classic. Create security.md. It's good to know that they're taking security seriously here. This one just says, "Yeah, yeah." How did they even do this? Someone even asked that exactly the same question.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Okay. Well, you know what? It's not all bad. I learned how to do this. I can allow an empty commit to happen.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Sometimes the best code is absolutely no code at all. Just remember that.
