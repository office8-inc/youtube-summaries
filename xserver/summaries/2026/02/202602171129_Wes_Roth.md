### 🎬 導入

So, big big story today. Open Claw gets acquired after a huge bidding war. The winner is OpenAI. And if you're wondering if I'm wearing these sunglasses to look cool, the answer is no. I just got a little bit scratched up because I landed on my face.

### 📋 背景・概要

We'll do a whole deep dive of how to avoid landing on your face in a different video. Today, we're talking about Open Claw and Open AI. Let's dive in. All right. So, if you've been living under a rock for the last few weeks, Open Claw used to be Moltbot, used to be Cloudbot, but it was this massive viral sensation designed to be a fullblown agentic framework.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

It basically took all the safeties off and allowed the world to truly experience what AI agents are capable of. It was a glorious thing to behold. Now, of course, it wasn't without its controversy. There were issues with security and figuring out, for example, for the social network, which one of those posts were in fact pushed forward by humans versus AI agents. An AI le religion titled the crustarianism spawned, if you will.

### 📝 詳細説明

But this is all February 2026. Like, all this happened this month. We're not halfway through the month yet, or we're just at the halfway point. And all this happened this month in the first half of the month. This thing blows up.

### 💡 実例・デモ

200,000 GitHub stars, 1.5 million agents created. And just as this thing is just hitting its peak, Anthropic comes out and starts, you know, getting the lawyers involved saying they can't call it Claudebot. It's too close to Anthropics Claude. The creator of the project, Peter Steinberger, who by the way previously founded, created, and then later sold PSDF kit for I think like $150 million or hundred million euros. But either way, incredibly, incredibly impressive.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

But he sort of comes back out of retirement to launch this thing, blows it up. Anthropic goes after him. By the way, I'm not super duper happy with how Anthropic handled this whole thing. There are so many things about Anthropic that I absolutely love. Them pushing people around, shutting stuff down, cutting off API access to anything that they consider a threat or a competitor.

### 🎯 応用例

Not a huge fan of that personally. I understand they might have the reasons, but Enthropic turns the screws on Peter Steinberger, who proceeds to do multiple name changes, loses some of the handles in the process as he's trying to move from one to the other. People jump in there, grab the handles, eventually finding Open Claw, has all the handles that he needs kind of sort of pre-arranged. So, I got to give him kudos for thinking on his feet, moving fast. I feel like the man probably lived decades in the last two weeks in terms of just the sheer amount of stuff that he had to do and experience and contend with.

### 💭 考察

And of course throughout this whole thing, this really shows, I think, to the world what we're all kind of waiting for, what we're truly interested in. We've been talking about it for quite some time in this channel. It's autonomous AI agents. And so far, most of the releases by the big labs have been underwhelming. The closest thing that I've seen that really kind of sparked my imagination at first was Manis.

### 📌 まとめ

When Mannis first came out, I was doing a number of videos on it. I was impressed by how they put it together because as you sort of fumble it fit, you start realizing first and foremost at its core. And again, this is at the time when it was just just coming out. I'm sure they changed a lot of things since then, but it was basically an Ubuntu virtual machine. If you saw my installation instructions for how to install OpenClaw, one of the things I recommend is using an Ubuntu machine.

### ✅ 結論

It's open. It's very powerful. And Ubuntu is just a flavor. Linux is really what we're talking about. You can use a number of different sort of Linux setups.

### 📚 追加情報

But the point was it was a Linux virtual machine. It had Claude, whatever version of claude we were on at that point. And it was interchangeable, but behind the scenes you were running claude, and it could call all sorts of commands on the command line interface. And it was like the first glimpse that we saw into what was possible. Now, of course, that got scooped up by Meta.

### 🔖 補足

I think how the whole story went is Mark Zuckerberg, you know, they're text, he's texting back and forth with Alexander Wang, who's now leading a lot of the AI efforts for for Meta. Mark tells him, "Hey, this Mattis thing is pretty cool. Can you can you buy it for me?" Alexander Wayne comes back, says, "Yep." Goes, "You got it, boss. All right. Just acquired it." And Mark responds going, "Oh, did you get me the pro or the the premium version?" Alexander Wayne's like, "Oh, you meant just like buy you a subscription.

### 🎨 セクション 13

I bought the whole thing." I'm totally kidding. That was a joke. I apologize. I'm sorry. Won't happen again.

### 🚀 セクション 14

But the point was that Open Claw was kind of a new step forward in that direction, right? They you install the thing on your local computer and it could be Macs or Linux or, you know, if you're running in the cloud, whatever else you want. I went through the installation process of how to install it on a Linux computer. There was a lot of similarities to what Manis was, but this was open source. was completely open and transparent and visible and a lot more powerful.

### ⚡ セクション 15

But while Manis was sort of a glimpse into what AI agents could be, Open Claw was like the big leap forward once it sort of unleashed upon the world. The reason it became the fastest growing open project ever is because it really showed the power of what it could be. So apparently Mark Zuckerberg was texting or talking with Peter, the creator of OpenClaw. Apparently, they're going back and forth arguing about which models are better for coding. Mark explained what he liked about OpenClaw, which by the way, kudos to him.

### 🌟 セクション 16

He's out there testing stuff out. He's like on the cutting edge. Very, very impressive, you know, reaching out to the founder himself, to the creator of OpenClaw, and later around the same time, I'm not sure, but making a significant offer from Meta to acquire OpenClaw. By the way, if you have a guess of how much these offers were, definitely let me know down in the comments. So keep in mind Peter did exit for we think 150 million in the past.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So money was likely not to be an issue. He was covering all the costs of running OpenC claw himself 10 to 20,000 a month likely you know just for hosting and all the other stuff that you needed to just to just run those operations. At some point he did also mention hiring an AI safety researcher to help him with some of this stuff. But there was but the point is there was a number of different acquisition proposals. I'm sure different structures, but whatever they may have been, Peter decides to go with OpenAI.

### 📋 セクション 18

And in the same kind of way that that we've been recently seeing, it's an aqua hire, meaning that they're not buying Open Claw. Open Claw is still out there. It's unpurchased. It's been moved into an independent foundation. So now it's kind of its own thing.

### ⭐ セクション 19

OpenAI did not buy the code to make OpenCloud proprietary or anything of the sort. They're buying Peter, I guess you you could say. That's probably the worst way possible saying it. They're basically acquiring him and his brain to come and work for OpenAI. And Open AI is committed to sponsoring and supporting Open Claw, keeping it open source, make sure it remains open.

### 📝 セクション 20

And if OpenClaw wasn't their target, if they wanted Peter, then then what was the point of all of that? Well, as they put it, they want Peter to join to build the next generation of personal agents, which Alvin stated would be a core OpenAI product. So, I would not be surprised here if OpenAI's offer was not the biggest one in terms of money. By the way, Anthropic really feels like they really fumbled. They they dropped the ball here because as Peter's been saying, he really enjoys having the Clawude series of models as sort of like the main driver for these AI agents.

### 💡 セクション 21

Even though he prefers the codeex series of models for for coding, he believes that they are the better coders. But had Anthropic not gone after him and did all the stuff that they did, I feel like they might have been able to negotiate a a deal with Peter and get Open Claw under the anthropic umbrella. Because here's the thing. Here's why Peter decided to go with OpenAI. These are my guesses, plus some of the things that he hinted at during his various interviews.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Number one, it was access to the latest toys, right? Having access to the latest GPT5 series or the the Codex models or even potentially the stuff that us mortals aren't allowed to see because again, it's very possible that there's models out there that are more powerful that we have access to, especially if they're kind of ungated. those first early versions of them might just have a little bit more horsepower than the stuff that that is finally released. So, who checks those boxes? Well, it's opening ionthropic Google potentially.

### 🎯 セクション 23

But if we're talking about coding models specifically, I mean, right now it's there's there's two that are on top. Codex 5.3 and Opus 4.6, that's openi and anthropic. They are the clear leaders in the space for coding models. Number two, I think he believes in autonomy and kind of like the open-source mission. I think anthropic showed that they're just not aligned culturally or visionwise in that aspect.

### 💭 セクション 24

They are playing a little bit more closed, a little bit more close to their chest. And Peter likely wanted to keep open claw a community asset to to be as useful and open as possible and anthropic already showed that they are not willing to do that. There's also some personal chemistry with Sam Alman and Peter. So Peter describes Alman as very thoughtful and brilliant and OpenAI the entire team kind of understood the agentic timeline that was increasing and of course OpenAI recently just about a month ago at this point they partnered up with Cerebras in an effort to add ultra low latency AI compute so that compute power just the sheer speed of OpenAI's architecture might have been a huge draw. So, I'm personally very curious to see what they're going to be building with Peter's help because, as I said early on, I don't think the labs can unleash something like Open Claw.

### 📌 セクション 25

It's there's too many issues, too many vulnerabilities, too many potential problems. So, for example, if you haven't heard, the Chinese government actually issued a high-profile alert on February 5th of this year specifically for Open Claw. The Chinese developers love this open- source project. It became very popular with the developers and giants like BU, Alibaba and Tencent. And so the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology they put out a statement a warning if you will talking about number one the open gateway vulnerability basically OpenCloud would trust any connection coming from certain local gateways and if if you set up in the cloud and something got hacked it could make external requests look like local traffic.

### ✅ セクション 26

But the other big thing they warn about and this is something that we've talked about briefly is this whole idea of self-modification of autonomous vibe coding. I refer to it as almost like a a viral like gain of function growth to usually for me the the first several hours of setting up a new agent would be spent by actually just telling it to build various tools and abilities for it to use. So it basically be able to modify its own source code through these gentic loops. So if you want these AI agents to have something that's predictable, that's controllable, this really goes against that. So if the bot itself is changing, modifying its own source code to improve itself and give itself new abilities.

### 📚 セクション 27

First of all, I mean, that's truly kind of like the self-modifying recursively self-improving AI that we've talked about, that we've kind of been either looking forward to or dreading. I mean, Open Claw really really was a kind of proto version of that. We we saw it happening alive and it was incredibly impressive. And like I said previously, the reason it was so amazing and the reason that it was somewhat more dangerous, let's say, it wasn't like you could have those capabilities and have it be perfectly safe. The reason it worked is because both of those were sort of turned up.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Those two things kind of entangled as as you turn up the capabilities, you also turn down the safety, you could say. if it's able to improve itself and create its own skills that gives it power and capability and automation while at the same time creating potential governance nightmares and security vulnerabilities etc. So it's unlikely that we could see something like open claw you know developed by openai or anthropic or or any of these other companies reliability would be too great but obviously they are seeing a lot of potential in these things they want that many users to be using their products so the question is now they have a peter what is that next generation AI agent capability that they're planning to build I mean if we could have something with the power of open claw without the limitations without the security issues that would be kind of staggering and maybe Peter is the exact right guy to help OpenAI build that. So, let me know what you think about this. What do you think about Open Cloud moving forward?

### 🎨 セクション 29

Did it lose its crablike luster? Did lose its shine because now it's no longer with Peter. Peter's not spending his entire focus, his entire day working on it. It's a standalone entity. What do you think about OpenAI?

### 🚀 セクション 30

Are you happy that they were the ones that now will use Peter and his genius and brilliance to to work on that next generation of AI agents? What's your take on this? And tomorrow, me and Dylan, we're going to be recording our weekly podcast where we're going to dive into this, but also we'll unpack the whole thing with my credit card getting stolen. If you've missed that whole fiasco, we'll dive into deeper details. We might even talk about why landing on your face is bad.

### ⚡ セクション 31

With that said, if you made it this far, thank you so much for watching. My name is Wes Roth. I'll see you in the next
