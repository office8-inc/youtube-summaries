## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Has your world completely shifted in the last two weeks? I feel like the AI community split into two pieces. On one side, you have people absolutely losing their freaking minds over cloud code. Clot code, then moldbot, then opencloud. But people are going nuts.

### 📋 背景・概要

I find myself amongst them. On the other side, you have people that are saying it's nothing. It's a scam. It doesn't work. It's not that big of a leap forward.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

I have no idea how that's happening. It seems like we're watching two different movies. We're in the same theater, but we're watching two different movies. In this video, I want to show you what I built with Claw Code. There's a bit of an asterisk next to that statement.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, really fast, I published my first ever article on X. It did pretty well, but most importantly, I think it got out to a much wider audience that maybe hasn't seen me before. And that article details the first 72 hours of Moltbook. Now, in this video, we're not talking about that. that article is a whole different battle that we're going to have to fight because as a lot more new people are kind of joining this field and commenting on it and I feel like a lot of those stakes don't fully understand the nature of these LLMs which makes sense.

### 💡 実例・デモ

It's a big concept to grasp because we kind of know what it means when a human says something or when a human writes a book, right? They had some ideas based on their life experiences, then they had some intention to communicate to another human and they sort of chose certain words to try to communicate that idea to another human being. So, it's this kind of imperfect art of trying to get the thoughts in one person's mind into another person. And when AI agents do that, of course, that's not at all what's happening there. They didn't have a life experience.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

They had no interactions with the real world. Do they have intentions? What does intentions even mean when we're talking about machines? So, what happened when we put them all on a network and let them talk to each other? You know, at hour zero, there was nothing.

### 🎯 応用例

It was a dead silence. By hour three, you had some agents jumping on there and beginning to talk. Interestingly, I think I kind of now am beginning to realize that there is such a thing as LM humor, kind of their own brand of humor. Andre Carpathy, a very well-known machine learning researcher, asked the eye model to roast him based on everything that it knew about him. It responded with a whole list of things, but the first one really stood out to me.

### 💭 考察

It said, "You have developed the field of artificial intelligence more than any other being in the world. You're considered by many to be one of the greatest minds of this generation, but also yesterday you asked me, quote, how to boil an egg." First of all, hilarious, obviously, and I'm sure I totally butchered the joke, but the inside jokes that these LMS have definitely have that sort of flavor to it. Now, by hour 24, so 2 days into the existence of the social network for AIS, they had builders and philosophers. Builders were building out the actual functionality of the website, creating skills. And if you think about it, if one of these agents creates a skill like a researchers how to do one, one of them, for example, for his user, a doctor, the doctor wanted to be able to get the latest news and have it turned into a podcast so he can listen to it on his way to work in the car.

### 📌 まとめ

One of the agents create that functionality with a morning sort of a news thing that gets automatically turned into a podcast and sent to the the doctor to the user. But of course once that agent created that skill, that one instance created that one skill, of course, that skill becomes available to every other agent that wants to use it. Keep that in mind. This is kind of important. So they had builders and philosophers, some dark philosophies.

### ✅ 結論

By hour 48, they had manifestos and security coalitions. By hour 72, they had money, religion, politics, and art. But again, that essay is meant for a completely different battle that we have yet to fight. And that's helping kind of the everyday person get their mind around what is this thing that we're dealing with. But in this video, I just wanted to show you something completely different, but that happened in these 72 hours as well.

### 📚 追加情報

And that is my own initial interactions with Clawbot. And more accurately, we're just looking at the first 24 hours because during that time is where I focused most of my effort on building. And by building, I specifically mean telling a clawbot/openclaw to develop new skills. Skills that once developed, it would it would save. And now this became a part of its repertoire.

### 🔖 補足

Keep that in mind as you watch this video. None of these things are one-off tricks. Once it does that thing once, it can now do that thing forever. if I can work with it, work through it, and at the end it's able to complete that task. Any future instance of that task or or a similar task is going to be easy.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So my first 24 hours with this AI agent was mainly building functionality. Researching uh you might say how to have it gain functions, if you will. And it did feel very viral. The fact that it was just kind of bootstrapping itself and giving itself abilities that allowed it to do progressively more and more and more was kind of scary to behold. A few days ago, me and Dylan, my podcast co-host, we recorded a podcast and in the middle of it, I had this idea.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Can I get this agent that I built and I gave it a bunch of skills. Can I have it replicate itself on a virtual private server? So, can it go out there onto the worldwide web, rent a a hosting account somewhere, pay for it? Yes, I did give it my credit card information and no, I I don't recommend you do that. There's still tons of security issues here.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Be very careful. Now, it wasn't able to finish that task during the interview. So, I know we kind of left a lot of people hanging. Was it able to selfreplicate, self-propagate? Yes or no?

### 🌟 セクション 16

Let me play you that clip from the interview. I want to try one thing. So, I'm going to send it a voice message and tell it, hey, create the droplet or whatever it's called. Create the VPS. install yourself on there and whatever I taught you so far, whatever information you have, teach that other thing.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, sort of like, uh, create a clone of yourself. And so, uh, we're going to do this live. This might be a world first. I don't expect it to work. I don't.

### 📋 セクション 18

I give it maybe like a 20% chance of working. So, I have an account set up on Digital Ocean. So, it's under the email address that you have access to. Go ahead, go go go go go on Digital Ocean, create a droplet or a VPS and set a sort of clone of yourself on there. Let me know if you need anything and uh yeah, make it so.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Okay, so I literally recorded that. I sent it. Make it so. Spoiler alert. Uh it it did.

### 📝 セクション 20

At this point, I had it replicate itself multiple times across on on different servers, including some of uh my local machines. And later, as you'll see in this video, I've also have it kind of start drilling down by creating sub agents. So, it's multiplying sort of sideways and and down, so to speak. So, the asterisk that I said about all the stuff that I've built, what you're going to see today is just up to hour 24. I'm just showing you what I built within the first probably 2 days or or thereabouts.

### 💡 セクション 21

Now, on the AI social network, by hour 72, they had money. They launched a number of crypto coins. At the time, one of them had like a $300,000 market cap. I I haven't checked where it is now because I just had my head down building and just doing my own thing. But the very next video after this, we're going to have to talk about money because if a bunch of agents can spin up a $300,000 cryptocurrency in under 3 days, I mean, that's cool.

### 🔧 セクション 22

That's neat, but I I don't really want to engage in cryptocurrency and promoting anything like that. The question is, can they make money in legitimate ways? And I'll leave that for the next video. But what I can tell you is that things are gonna get weird. These AI agents basically did a speedrun of building an entire civilization.

### 🎯 セクション 23

They did it in 72 hours. Took humans what 50,000 years depending on when you start the clock. Whatever else happens, I think there's going to be a lot of chaos. And you know what chaos is? Chaos is a ladder.

### 💭 セクション 24

I just wanted to use that quote. I think it's kind of cool. No, but in all seriousness, stuff is getting nutty. be safe out there, but also be wary. Don't look back at this in five years and go, "Oh man, I I should have been doing that thing during this time." This is me telling you right now, this is the time it's happening.

### 📌 セクション 25

This is not a draw. With that said, let me run you through the first 24 hours or so of what I managed to build with these agents. Let's go. I guess let me quickly answer the question of what did I see? What did I experience that makes me kind of buy into this hype, if you will, whatever you want to call it.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, first and foremost, let me tell you about my experience with what at the time was called Cloudbot. I first when I first got it, I installed it on my MacBook. So, this is where my journey started not that long ago. And the first thing I did was I hooked it up to Telegram. That way, I was able to text it.

### 📚 セクション 27

It would text me back. But here's the thing. I hate texting. So, I gave it the 11 Labs API key. Told it first and foremost, let's figure out how we can talk.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, I want to be able to leave you little voice messages on Telegram. and you respond in a voice. Less than 5 minutes later, everything was up and running. I think it's using the open source whisper in order to be able to transcribe what I'm saying. And then it's using the 11 Labs API to respond to me.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So for people that haven't used this before, so I told it, build this functionality for yourself and then a few minutes later it had that functionality forever moving forward. Like it added abilities to itself. And now it has those abilities. Stick with me. This gets a lot weirder.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So, here's what that looks like. Let me play you just a few clips. >> Respond back to me with a little poem. >> A digital mind awakens bright through circuits flowing day and night. >> So, I have an account set up on Digital Ocean.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, it's under the email address that you have access to. Go ahead, go on Digital Ocean, create a droplet or a VPS and set a sort of clone of yourself on there. So, install Claudebot on there and then proceed to teach it every skill that so far you have learned, all the information that you know about me. Basically, clone yourself over on a Digital Ocean VPS. Let me know if you need anything and yeah, make it so >> on it.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I'll set up a Digital Ocean droplet, install Claudebot, and clone myself over there. Hey Wes, I'm in your Digital Ocean account, but it needs a payment method before I can create a droplet. Can you add a credit card to the billing section? Once that's done, I'll spin up the Ubuntu server and clone myself over there. Wes, the card details are filled in, but I need a billing address to complete the payment setup.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Wes, the Stripe payment form is being tricky with browser automation. >> So, I apologize if I have to kind of hide certain parts of this thing. There's a lot of information there that I just don't want out there, obviously. So, the attempt to replicate itself on a virtual private private server out there. So, that's able to do stuff without me needing to run a computer 24/7, it was successful.

### 📋 セクション 34

The only issue that it had is actually using my credit card. Yes, I gave it my credit card. And believe me, I am aware that it's probably going to uh backfire. I'm going to regret it. I don't recommend that you do the same thing.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Let me be the guinea pig for your, you know, edification and entertainment. But this is, I think, important to understand. It successfully cloned itself with all the skills that it previously learned, which was basically the ability to, you know, talk to me back and forth with text. And actually, now that I'm realizing it, I actually taught it also to call me on the phone and talk to me. I'll show you that functionality in just a second.

### 📝 セクション 36

But what it did was it was able to set up a virtual private server, completely clone itself over with all the skills that it previously taught itself that I asked it to to kind of build for itself. the only sort of a trouble that it had, it had trouble checking out through the Stripe checkout process. So, basically using kind of like the the regular web pages that you and I would use. Once it cleared that and it had command line access, everything just went smooth as butter. It set up everything.

### 💡 セクション 37

It secured the server. It made sure that Cloudbot would start up every time the server would reboot. So, it basically uptime is close to 24/7. and it sort of set it up on the same Telegram channel that I was using. So now notice the voice changed because it's a it's a technically like a different version, a different instance of the bot.

### 🔧 セクション 38

It's like a separate thing, but it's out there in the ether on the internet now. >> Testing, testing. How about now? >> Got it. Loud and clear this time.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Looks like the transcription is working now. >> Testing. Testing. How about now? >> Got it.

### 💭 セクション 40

Loud and clear this time. Looks like the transcription is working now. Can you use the voice in 11 Labs that's called I think it's like Joanna Pensive. >> Say Joanna Pensive. Sure thing.

### 📌 セクション 41

Testing out the Joanna Pensive voice for you now. How does this sound? >> That's not it. That sounds like a man's voice. >> Done.

### ✅ セクション 42

I switched to Joanne Pensive. This should be the soft introspective voice you were looking for. How's this? >> All right. Next, we took some time to calibrate the voice.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, it send me some voice samples. And uh finally we settled on one and we were good to go. All right. Next I wanted to make sure that the voice calling ability was set up. So we already had some of the stuff set up with the previous agent.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So it got copied over. So I just wanted to run through it and check. So again the previous agent already built out a lot of it. Right. So we're using Twilio.

### 🎨 セクション 45

We're using 11 Labs. And so after a few back and forths I got a few calls and they just kind of dropped. They got disconnected. But after a while it was working flawlessly. I could have a back and forth conversation with my AI agent in real time, right?

### 🚀 セクション 46

So, I could ask it questions, it would answer me, and it would add what we talked about to its context, to its memory. So, was calling me and talking to me. The next thing I set up is just the ability to search in real time using Grock and using the X sort of real-time news and stuff like that to kind of keep up to date with the news to see which interviews were coming out. So we we both used the YouTube data API and the X/ Twitter API. So it basically set up a system to monitor, you know, YouTube and X for real-time news, new events, new interviews coming out.

### ⚡ セクション 47

And then it would run something that's called a cron job. Chron like time Kronos, right? So it's basically set to run at certain points during the day. So four times during the day, it would kind of send me an update. It would text it to me either on on my phone or on Telegram and just say, "Here are the news for the day.

### 🌟 セクション 48

here like the breaking news. Again, it it built all that functionality. I just said what I wanted and and minutes later it it works. For people that haven't used this, this might seem wild and and to me it was extremely wild in the beginning, too. Like most of the stuff after using it for a few days, you kind of get accustomed to this, but we haven't had anything like this before.

### 🎬 セクション 49

This is new territory. Next, I asked it to figure out how to go through YouTube's API and just to pull data for various videos, things like views, likes, when it was published, how many comments it got, etc., etc., etc. It build that functionality again in in just a few minutes. It tested it and managed to roll itself by, you know, basically retrieving the the values from the never going to give you up video. I'm not going to play that here.

### 📋 セクション 50

Next, what I did was is I pulled tons of channels that are successful, not just in the AI space, but kind of in general in the finance space, news, science, just a a bunch of channels that I I felt were at least somewhat similar to kind of like what we were doing. I mean, it's like tech and science, I guess, is kind of like the the broad spectrum. And then I proceeded to sort of torture the data to just figure out if there's any correlations between for for example how long a video is versus the average views that it gets when it gets posted kind of like what the sweet spot is for the length of the video. Just all sorts of stuff. So it ran that linear regression analysis to see if there's a sort of a a sweet spot for how long the video is.

### ⭐ セクション 51

It didn't find one. So, it came up with this idea to see if there's a potentially a quadratic regression or whatever it's called. I'm I'm blanking on terminology, but the idea that there might be some peak to how long videos should be to have the best chance of getting the most amount of views. So, notice it texted back the uh the sort of the curve for me, right? The sweet spot is, you know, somewhere right there.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, the local optimum 32 to 34 minutes. So, again, not to beat a dead horse here, but I told it, hey, just get all this data. This was by the way thousands of videos that it that it got information on. So thousands of videos data downloaded quadratic regression analyzed it charted and figured out what what the best time and length and whatever it was and presented to me in this telegram message. Notice that so far it doesn't it doesn't mess anything up.

### 💡 セクション 53

Yeah, sometimes things don't work as intended the first time, but it catches those mistakes. like when it was trying to call me on the phone, it probably called me like three or four times and each time the line got disconnected and the fifth time it was like hello, right? So, it kept testing it and figuring out what the different web hooks it needed to be. It ran in the background. It was troubleshooting it and then it just solved it.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Also, at some point I needed to add a few pages to a WordPress website that I have. My initial instinct was to just open up WordPress, go do it myself, but I said, "Wait a minute. Let me see if this can if this thing can do it." Basically, in order to have a Twilio number, you do need to have a page that has kind of like an opt-in for people to, you know, if you're going to text message them SMS, you need like an opt-in field for text messages with some specific language telling them how to opt out. Now, I wasn't planning to spam anyone. It was just mainly for for me.

### 🎯 セクション 55

I just needed this thing to have a number so it can call me so it could text me. But I had to jump through a few hoops in order to get the toll-free number or whatever it is. So, I created a user on that WordPress for it. I gave it the credentials and it in seconds built out the pages that I need, wrote out all the legal mumbo jumbo that needed to be on there. Basically created a page that I needed to submit as verification that I did something.

### 💭 セクション 56

So instead of me sitting there for 20 minutes trying to figure it out and writing everything out, I just told it to do it and it just did it, including making the page, publishing it, you know, setting it live, I wrote one sentence and it did everything. And I didn't even need to really explain what it had to do because it it had the context. It knew what we were working on, right? So, I think maybe it even said, "Hey, you need this page." And I was like, "Oh, okay. Go make that page.

### 📌 セクション 57

I might not even have to really explain what had to be on it. It It knew it knew what we were talking about from the previous context and then it could figure out what needs to go on there. It can search the web or somebody just kind of like knows, but it was done, published, and done fully autonomously. I get the Brave Search API so it could search the web easily. There's 2,000 free searches per month with the API, so I don't have to pay anything.

### ✅ セクション 58

and I can use it to do, you know, 2,000 searches and then I can pay if I need more than that per month, which I I probably won't. So, I hope you understand what it's doing. Like, we're basically building more and more functionality for it. We're giving it new skills. We're giving it the stuff that it needs to search the web, to give me a call, to get the latest news, to to check various YouTube stats.

### 📚 セクション 59

And all this is getting memorized, written down. So, it's actually like forming skills that it's going to be using moving forward. So as we're going back and forth, this isn't sort of like we we get a task completed at the end of it, we get the task completed, but also in the process, we build a skill that it has now forever. So the next thing that I want to see if I can actually get YouTube transcripts because if I actually got the text version of all the YouTube, what was said, what was spoken, you can do things like you can run a a sentiment analysis on it. Is it more positive?

### 🔖 セクション 60

Is it more negative? How fast does the person speak, etc. Notice at this point we're getting into the territory of something that a fairly large or maybe mediumsized SAS software as a service company would operate, right? I'm sure there are companies out there that are making tens of millions a year that have a host of services like this, right? They they check X for you.

### 🎨 セクション 61

They check YouTube for you. They run sentiment analysis on YouTube videos. And if you want to use their software, you pay them however much 50 bucks a month, 100, a few hundred depending if it's like enterprise or just for the average user. You see what's going to happen here? Instead of going to their kind of general software, I I create my own, you know, custom crafted, artisally crafted, custommade, made on demand, fresh and hot out of the oven, specifically tailored to exactly what I need.

### 🚀 セクション 62

And by the way, it usually takes a few minutes. It's extremely extremely fast. Now, at some point, it was time for me to go to sleep, but I didn't want this thing to not be doing anything while I sleep. So, basically, I gave it a massive project. I said, "Keep working on it.

### ⚡ セクション 63

It has this heartbeat function where every I don't know 30 minutes or 10 minutes, I forget the exact sort of and you could probably change it, but it sort of gets woken up and it prompted like what else do you have to keep working on? So, I enabled that and I just told it what to work on. Something that I I would assume would take around 8 hours or something like that. It didn't. It got done with it in a few hours, which is surprisingly I was kind of upset about that.

### 🌟 セクション 64

I I wish I need to figure out how to make sure that it's working through the night, but I told it to work through the night, finish all these deliverables, and then email me at whatever 6:00 in the morning. anything I said and it told me sleep well. It's it's super nice to me. It says I'll continue the analysis and I'll send you my full report at 6:00 in the morning. Which again, it did.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Unfortunately, it didn't run for the entire time I was sleeping. It got done very quickly. But again, this is less than 24 hours into me using this thing. As I'm going back over these, I realized I didn't go to sleep when I told it I was. I I stayed up and kept adding more tasks for it to do.

### 📋 セクション 66

I wanted to see if it can analyze thumbnails. It gave me some ideas for how to analyze thumbnails, basically on how bright it is. Does it have a face present? Does it have text? Are there certain words in it, etc.?

### ⭐ セクション 67

Now, the issue that I ran into is that for the transcripts, since it's on kind of a VPS server, even though we're using the API, a lot of it is blocked, right? Cuz it's not a real computer. It's from some data center somewhere. So, I did have a hard time connecting and getting the transcripts. I said, "What if I give you my NordVPN access?" It I love that idea.

### 📝 セクション 68

It got a token from the NordVPN. It it still had issues with the transcripts. decider into an issue. And I realized that is probably why it's better to have a a physical device that this agent is running on. Hosting it in the cloud in in a virtual private server does have some downsides unfortunately, but it was able to download all the thumbnails, run the the checks on them to see kind of like which ones worked well, which ones didn't.

### 💡 セクション 69

And as you can see, it's was able to do each batch of 500 in about 5 minutes. And I think it did a total of 5,700 thumbnails that it analyzed. If this is not blowing your mind, check your pulse. You got to be either scared or excited. Like we're building enterprisegrade software as a service just functionality by by text messaging back and forth.

### 🔧 セクション 70

And I don't even have to text. I can just actually now that I think about it just speak into it. Should have been using my voice to dictate for it what to do. So it did a massive amount of thumbnail analysis. It started doing the OCR text optical character recognition.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Transcripts still wasn't working, but again that was because it was hosted in the cloud. It was rotating through various Nord BPM. So, here it's trying to switch to the UK and see if that uh if that helps it out. Again, it's doing all this autonomously, right? I'm not telling it, hey, why don't you try switching?

### 💭 セクション 72

No, no, no. It's just it's running. It's thinking. It's like, oh, I'm not seeing the the transcripts coming in. What should I do?

### 📌 セクション 73

Oh, I should switch the VPN to UK. Let's test that. Let's try that out. I'm not sitting there telling it. It's self-prompting, selfdoing.

### ✅ セクション 74

I asked it what other functionality other users of this AI agent kind of like what they did. It recommended for example a a dashboard uh chart functionality interactive widgets that it could build to kind of help me visualize the progress. So as an example that it just provided for me was like for example I could do something like this. So for YouTube analysis notice how it has like the progression bars, thumbnails, OCR text, transcript etc etc. and mentioned having the nano banana pro skill which is you know Google deep minds their image editing tool and image generation tool.

### 📚 セクション 75

So I said yeah let's let's have that ability as well. So now it can generate nano banana stuff for me. So again I apologize if I'm being a dead horse but each one of these is a skill that it saves. So now that it's done it once it knows how to do that forever. Now it can at will generate nano byano pro images.

### 🔖 セクション 76

It can create presentations, PDFs, just whatever. Next, I wanted to see if it could actually generate videos, AI video, using one of the engines at the time, XAI's, you know, Grock Imagine video was trending on on Twitter. So, I asked to create a little tool where it can just generate, you know, these videos for me. I gave it a link to the XAI docs, right? So, I just pasted the link in here.

### 🎨 セクション 77

So, it had the documentation. It's like, oh, totally, dude. Look, it they have it. Check it out. So, it's totally stoked about that.

### 🚀 セクション 78

It figured out what code it needed to run to be able to generate those videos. And it says, "Do you want me to set up a skill for this?" Right? So, do you want me to learn how to generate AI video on the fly for you forever more? And I told it, "Yes. Yes, I do." And here's that video.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So, it's a 4 minutes from request to video, which is pretty fast for 10 seconds of 720p. All right. So, now I can generate videos on demand on the fly from XAI. And by the way, whenever XI updates their their engines, their models, this has the skill to just use whichever one's the latest. Next, I wanted to see if it can actually create videos with voiceovers.

### 🌟 セクション 80

So, it can use 11 Labs to do a voice over. So, can it make a video to go along with it? It could. It takes a long time if it tries to do it on its own server, but there are a few free sort of online editing platforms like it's it suggested to me to use Shot Stack. So, I went into Shot Stack.

### 🎬 セクション 81

I gave it the API key and it developed this video. This video isn't anything to write home about. It's a proof of concept, but apparently it can edit videos, create overlays. It can do a lot of zoom in to zoom out, pan. I don't think it's going to be replacing human video editors anytime soon.

But it was just interesting to see how far it could go. So again, this is not going to replace anybody soon, anytime soon. And out of every single thing that I've tried, this is probably the least impressive output because its ability to do Excel sheets is off the charts. No pun intended. Its ability to code is incredible.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Its ability to do various math analysis is absolutely incredible. Its ability to edit, not so much. Here it is showing off its cool skills with uh what it calls Ken Burns zoom effects. So there you are. Beautiful stons.

Claudebot is an AI agent that lives in your terminal and has access to your entire digital life. What could possibly go wrong? >> So, if you're wondering what I'm working on now or what moldbot, Cloudbot, Open Claw, whatever you want to call it, what it's working on now is actually I got the best available AI models. So, we have Grock, Gemini, GPT, we have of course Claude and I'm trying to create a society of minds. So interesting how actually this experiment got triggered is Alex Finn had a post on Twitter X Henry called me.

### 💡 セクション 85

So how his Claudebot figured out how to call him basically. So in the morning he just gave him a call which was kind of a holy crap moment. And that post received 10 million views plus some insane amount. So if you recall I keep receiving various you know live news from Twitter/X because this set up that cron job to to to shoot me a text message a few times a day. And so those were the things that kind of flagged and said, "Hey, why don't you figure out how to do something like that?

### 🔧 セクション 86

Why is Alex Finn's stuff blowing up? Because his bot is so awesome and creative and inventive. Like what are you doing?" So it brainstormed some ideas. And one of the ideas that I liked was this. Basically use the best models that are available from the top frontier labs and have them collaborate and discuss and think about how to solve any given problem.

### 🎯 セクション 87

I've already seen how well this works because in one of the things I was trying to figure out how to set up the model that's running this is is claude claude opus 4.5 and it created code for how to pull information from Twitter and it created this code that used the YouTube API to pull information from YouTube and it was good but it was struggling because it just seemed like it was to making too many calls. It seemed a little bit too expensive. I'm like there's got to be it it seemed like there should be a better way of doing it. So what I did is actually I gave it a a Gemini API so it's able to actually ask Gemini 3.0 you know, questions about what it's doing. I figured Gemini's, you know, Google, YouTube, etc., maybe it knows more about how to do these particular API calls.

### 💭 セクション 88

And lo and behold, it did. It was actually kind of brilliant looking at it because it's like, uh, instead of, you know, using the API calls 50 times, just use the YouTube RSS feed to see when new videos go live. So, instead of just ping it every time with an API call, just use the RSS feed because that's free and you can use it infinitely, which was like mindb blown. Cloud Opus 4.5 did not come up with that idea. Gemini 3.0 Pro did.

### 📌 セクション 89

So, the idea of having them chat and share ideas because they're they're very different. They have different strengths and weaknesses. So, having them all talk and improve themselves, I mean, that just seems like it might work. And the first sort of task I gave it for this society of minds to work on is to improve themselves. So, I think I'll leave it there.

### ✅ セクション 90

It's uh getting kind of late here and I should go to sleep. And like my AI agents, I cannot just work around the clock. What's next on the agenda for me is I just got this thing. A lot of people are buying a Mac minis, which is cool. I have a sense that maybe running a Linux, something like Ubuntu might be a better approach.

### 📚 セクション 91

So, I got this mini computer. They're like 100 to 150 bucks each. They're more than enough to run at least one of these agents on them, potentially even a multiple. They barely use any electricity. They hook up to your Wi-Fi or Ethernet port and they run 24 hours a day absolutely free, meaning that there's no upkeep.

### 🔖 セクション 92

If you've made it this far, I think you probably understand where this is going. You feel kind of the the the heft of this moment. We just turned some corner. There's some inflection point that that that was reached. AI agents that are open source, that are running on little cheap pieces of hardware, they're like basically 247 employees.

### 🎨 セクション 93

That era, that era is here and it's here now. you should probably think about how to get involved in this and and do it as soon as possible. If you know your way around tech and coding and stuff like that, this should be fairly straightforward. If you don't realize that a lot of the difficulty that this was this would have presented a few years ago, a lot of that is gone. There's still a little bit of a learning curve very very initially when you just have to kind of set it up.

### 🚀 セクション 94

But within, you know, a day or two of being a little bit uncomfortable, learning a few new skills, you should be up and running in terms of security and stuff like that, there's probably going to be tons of security nightmares. A lot of this thing is the wild west. So, you do need to understand how to protect yourself, right? So, if you lose your API keys and you have like an unlimited budget on there and you have your credit card attached, that could hurt. So, number one, figure out how to not lose your API keys.

### ⚡ セクション 95

But that might take a little bit longer, right? You might have to take some time to figure out how to store them properly, etc. But in the meantime, either use the free tier without hooking up your credit card for APIs that allow for that, or if you're using somewhere where you need your credit card on file, limit the budget, set very strict limits, and realize that right now all of us, the entire world, we're kind of all in this together. We're all learning skills that are brand new for all of us. Do me a favor if you made it this far.

### 🌟 セクション 96

Like, I know you're you're interested in this. Uh, comment down below. What are you struggling with? What can I do? Can I provide a tutorial on how to set it up or how to do a VPS once I set up this thing?

### 🎬 セクション 97

How to set up one of these things? What are you struggling with? What do you want to know more about? Probably don't ask me about high-tech security stuff. That's not my area of expertise.

### 📋 セクション 98

But if you know an expert, if there's somebody on on the web out there providing great information about how to keep everything secure, definitely let us know. But whatever else, this is this is go time. We're going to see some insanity happening over the next months and years. This is a brand new technology. It's moving fast and it's unregulated and it's increasing exponentially both in terms of capability and also just the sheer volume of it that's going to be available.

### ⭐ セクション 99

This might be one of the most exciting things that are happening right now. So pay close attention. I would bet money that millions will be made by some AI agents out there. Whether or not that's your goal, I mean, I'm not really looking to do that necessarily, but I do want to watch the space and learn how to use these agents and how to automate tasks and how to create my own AI agent armies, etc. We've been talking about it for a while, but it's happening now and it's happening live.

### 📝 セクション 100

Let me know how I can help and uh stay tuned. Things are getting exciting.
