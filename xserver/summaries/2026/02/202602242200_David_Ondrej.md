## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I feel like Noah before the great flood trying to warn people against things that are about to happen such as the collapse of the pensions because the new generations are much smaller than the older ones and people when they retire they need their pensions paid. Another thing I'm trying to warn about is the birth rates. All of Europe is basically below 1.5 children per woman. You need [music] 2.1 for society to be stable. Not even growing, just for society to be stable, which means we are literally [music] going extinct and nobody's paying attention.

### 📋 背景・概要

Another thing is the devaluation of fiat currency. US dollar, the euro, all the mainstream currencies, their value is going to zero because of endless printing. Yet, nobody's paying attention and most people have most of their money in fiat currency. So maybe I just need to gather up those [music] that do listen, put them into one great arc, and hope that we survive the flood.
