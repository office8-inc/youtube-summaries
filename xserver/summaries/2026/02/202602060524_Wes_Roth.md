## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, everyone decided to release everything all at once right now. But let's just focus on one thing at a time. First and foremost, we have Opus 4.6. So, Opus 4.6 is of course Anthropic's latest large model. Currently, Anthropic is causing tons of shock waves that kind of reverberate throughout the industry.

### 📋 背景・概要

For a smaller company than a lot of the other Frontier AI labs, they have a massive, massive effect on the industry. In the last week or so, they released some plugins for Claude Co-work, their AI tool for everyday work. Once people kind of realized the extent of what these plugins can be used for, it caused a massive tech sector stock meltdown. Of course, Claudebot renamed it to Open Claude that was largely driven on Unclaude, the Anthropic model. And while everybody's kind of reeling from what's been happening, here comes Anthropic again, dropping the next big thing.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And before you relax, it's still not over because they have confirmed that Claude Sonnet 5 is just around the corner. Claude Sonnet 5 might be a even bigger deal than what we've seen so far. It really depends on how the benchmarks come out. But today, for the time being, let's just focus on Claude Opus 4.6 and the other thing that Anthropic released. So the important thing to understand here is that this new release it isn't just another sort of incremental innovation and incremental step forward.

### 📝 詳細説明

It's a pivot towards autonomous agency. I think after openclaw and cloudbot we all expected all these AI labs to try to release something similar. It was of course them that developed all the models. They they built a lot of the infrastructure, but the creator of Open Claw, this one guy comes out of retirement, creates an opensource harness and just utilizes their models and makes a a massive splash. They they can't just ignore that.

### 💡 実例・デモ

But I'll be honest, I didn't expect how fast they would move because today, just within the last hour, I'm not kidding, within 1 hour, both Anthropic and OpenAI dropped their answer to OpenClaw, or at least the enterprise version of it. Let's let's dive in. So, first and foremost, there's going to be this word that we're probably going to be hearing quite a bit more moving forward, similar to how we had SAS in the past, right? Software as a service. And over time, with the release of these AI models, people started using intelligence as a service.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And that's still kind of its own branch. But now, we're beginning to see kind of this new thing forming. It's likely going to be called labor as a service. These frontier AI labs will provide AI employees. They will provide AI models and AI infrastructure that will be able to do work just like an employee from a computer.

### 🎯 応用例

And we'll see what sort of word catches on to describe that. I believe it's going to be labor as a service. So, Anthropic releasing their plugins for Claude Co-work caused like we said a massive, like I said, a a massive stock meltdown. Now, a lot of us following AI very closely. We we kind of knew that was coming because a lot of us were using Claude code.

### 💭 考察

People were being completely blown away by how good cloud code was. But cloud code looked like a a terminal if you didn't have experience with software development. You just you looked at it and you just didn't want anything to do with it. I think it was very kind of repulsive to most people that that hadn't used those sort of tools before those sort of environments. So cloud coowwork was meant to be for the rest of the world for normies as as they say online.

### 📌 まとめ

And so Cloud Co-work plus these plugins, massive tech market selloff, especially targeting companies that make a lot of money through SAS software as a service. So Opus 4.6 is yet another thing kind of piling on top of that. That goes very much along with it. So what's the big deal about Opus 4.6? Well, first and foremost, it has now a 1 million token context window.

### ✅ 結論

It's still in beta, but this is the first time an Opus class model can hold that much in its context window, which is a big deal for for certain tasks, specifically coding. The ability to hold a large portion of the code base to be able to remember what it's working on is going to be a big deal. It was very noticeable with Gemini when it first came out. So, as we start using this model, people will probably notice the the effect of that expanded context window. Number two big thing about Opus 4.6 ICS is its agentic planning.

### 📚 追加情報

So 4.5 it was great. It it followed instructions. 4.6 takes it a step further in that it can selfcorrect. It identifies its own bugs during code generation and then is able to correct them before presenting the final result. So as you'll see a lot of the results on the benchmarks this idea of agentic planning the larger context window.

### 🔖 補足

The goal here is for it to excel at long horizon tasks. So on humanity's last exam, for example, we went from right around 30% without tools to now 40% without tools. A a pretty big leap. And with tool use, we went from 43% to 53%. So Opus 4.5 to Opus 4.6, a big leap on humanity's last exam.

### 🎨 セクション 13

RGI2, it goes from 37.6 to 68.8. But the really big leaps here are in agentic terminal coding, agentic computer use, agentic tool use, agentic search, etc. You get you get the trend here. So this model is designed for long horizon tasks work that takes hours or days for human. And they've also confirmed the imminent launch of Claude Sonnet 5.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So apparently internal name for it was Fenic and Fenick, Claude Sonnet 5, whatever it's called. Well, this thing is going to be the speed demon. So, we're not sure exactly where we're going to see Sonnet 5. A lot of people were saying it was going to be released yesterday. So, different people sort of had different ideas of when it was going to be released.

### ⚡ セクション 15

You know what I think happened? Honestly, you remember in Game of Thrones where Tyrion, he sort of feeds three different pieces of information to three different people to try to flesh out the spy, whoever's been like revealing his secrets. And so, based on which information ends up out there, he's going to know who the spy is. I think Enthropic did the exact same thing. So they give gave some misinformation to different people and the leakers said, "Oh, it's going to happen, you know, yesterday." And kind of based on that, they can figure out who was behind the initial leak of the information.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I mean, I would not be shocked if that's in fact exactly what happened. But the point is that Sonnet 5 is reportedly better than Opus 4.5, right? So as of, you know, a few hours ago, one of the best coding models, one of the models that's really wowing people in its agentic use, etc. now superseded by by 4.6. But prior to this, the greatest model or one of them that the world has ever seen.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Sonnet 5 supposedly leapfrogged that model was better than that model while being 50% cheaper and significantly faster and apparently now can run parallel sub aents. So kind of a spin up a swarm of sub aents to work on tasks in parallel. So, we're not quite sure which one of those things is still confirmed about Sonic 5. So, as it hasn't been released yet, although there's a lot of rumors swirling about it. So, take anything about Sonic 5 with a grain of salt.

### 📋 セクション 18

That's not official as of yet, as far as I'm aware, but it's likely that we're going to see that very, very soon. And today, they've also introduced agent teams. So, you're able to spin up multiple agents that are working in parallel, working on the same project. So, this is still in research preview. Now here we've been talking about this sort of idea, this thing for quite some time and uh I was referring to it as agentic swarms, right?

### ⭐ セクション 19

Swarms of autonomous AI agent that that you sort of spin up and and it goes and does your bidding. Of course, that's not great corporate language. They're probably not going to refer to it as agent swarms. The language that's emerging for this is orchestrated multi- aent systems or or something like that. But the point is that you can have multiple agents working together with some sort of an orchestration in between them.

### 📝 セクション 20

If you have multiple repos that need to talk together, you can have two different agents working on them in a parallel when doing research. So the big deal here is that it kind of eliminates that sequential bottleneck of having to do things one at a time. So tasks that might have taken 30 minutes of back and forth with a chatbot can now be done in in five minutes because you can have multiple agents running in parallel completing those tasks. In other words, AI is is Factorio. If you've played Factorio before, you're probably ready for what's coming.

### 💡 セクション 21

Now, there's another video that I'm doing that's actually going to come out after this one that's going to give a lot more context about where these things are going because a few hours before this release, maybe even less than 1 hour before this got released, OpenAI released their frontier. And as you'll see there, Frontier, this new thing that got released, it's a little bit more fleshed out and a little bit more explicit about where it's going. Basically the idea for these companies is to become the either the operating system for on which businesses run well their operations their business. So you can think of it as an operating system or another sort of mental model of how to see this is it being a sort of an HR department a human resources department HR but for AI agents. We'll unpack that in a later video coming today but I just wanted to put this out there and welcome Opus 4.6 6 to the world.

### 🔧 セクション 22

As soon as this thing got announced, it got released. So, I have my agent running the open claw agent. So, immediately I ask it, so you're on Opus 4.5. Can you upgrade yourself to Opus 4.6? And it goes, oh, cool.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Yeah, I totally can. Give me a second. And then it's radio silence. So, I should probably go and check out what happened because I'm getting a little bit concerned. I haven't heard from it in in 10 or 20 minutes, but I'll report back as as soon as we know more.

### 💭 セクション 24

I'm sure he's fine. Everything's fine, but I better go check. So, see you in a
