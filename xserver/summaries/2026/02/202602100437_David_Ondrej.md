## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This is OpenClaw, also known as Clawbot, and it's the most popular AI agent of all time. You give it access to its own computer, and it can do basically anything from sending emails to managing your calendar, booking restaurants, building software, and even running your business. Yeah, Open Claw is insane, but most people have a really basic setup. In this video, I'll show you how to build the most powerful Open Claw setup possible, even if you're a complete beginner. Now, the first decision you have to make when using Open Claw is whether you're going to set it up on a Mac Mini or on a VPS.

### 📋 背景・概要

Now, each has their pros and cons, but the biggest difference is that for a Mac Mini, you have to spend at least $600 to buy it. VPS is much more affordable and you can manage it from anywhere. So, this is what I'm going to show you in this video. And by the way, this is the main idea that makes OpenClaw so goddamn strong. You give a full computer, whether it's a Mac Mini or a VPS, to an AI agent, and it can do anything on that computer.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So if you think David this might be an overkill why not just do chbttt you're just missing the point. This is what makes open call powerful and it's worth it spending 10 15 minutes actually setting this up because if you do you will have an incredible advantage in 2026 over everyone else that doesn't. And by the way if you're wondering David what are you using for their VPS? Well I'm using hostinger and the main reason is that they quickly added their open claw setup which makes it super easy to deploy open claw. So this is their new landing page and I'm going to link it below.

### 📝 詳細説明

Just go to the right and click on deploy. And this will take you to the Hostinger card here. Make sure to select the period 24 months. As you can see, they have a very nice promotion going on. Will save you $260.

### 💡 実例・デモ

But if you want to save another 10%, go to the right and type in code David to save additional 10% on top of their already nice sale. Then here you'll see that it will auto deploy OpenClaw saving us a bunch of time. And then her all that remains is scrolling down, selecting our server location. Let's do something in Europe like Lithuania. And then click continue, which will take you to the checkout.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And here just fill out your first name, last name, and complete the purchase. Now, as you can see, Hostinger makes the OpenClaw setup so easy. It gives you this nice interface where you can just paste in any API keys you want to use inside of OpenClaw, and you don't have to be a DevOps expert at all. This is by far the easiest way to set up OpenClaw. Oh, by the way, this OpenClaw gateway token, make sure to copy that and save it somewhere.

### 🎯 応用例

We're going to need it later. Now, we need to decide which AI model are we using. Enthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, XAI. Right now, Opus 4.6 from Enthropic is really, really good. So we need to get our API key from the enthropic platform.

### 💭 考察

So just go to console entropic type that into Google and we need to find the enthropic API key. So we can use either Sonet or Opus models. All right. So here go to the left and scroll down to API keys and then top right click on create key. Select your workspace.

### 📌 まとめ

I'm going to select my vector one. I'm do open claw VPS. Add a key. Copy it. Now do not share API keys with anybody.

### ✅ 結論

I'm going to delete mine before uploading this video. All right. So we're adding the anthropic one. And then we can continue. And now Hostinger is deploying our VPS.

### 📚 追加情報

All right, there it is. Project deployed. That was fast. It was like 1 minute or something. Now once the VPS finishes deploying, just click on this link right here and it will take you to the open claw login.

### 🔖 補足

We need the gateway token. So hopefully you copied that earlier, but if you haven't, don't worry. I'm going to show you how to recover it. So inside of your VPS right here, click on terminal. This will open the terminal with a bunch of stuff.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Just type in clear and here paste in this command right here. Boom. This will reveal your open cloud gateway token. Again, do not share this publicly. Make sure to keep this private.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So, I'm going to copy that. Go back here and paste it in and log in. And there we go. This is our OpenClaw gateway dashboard. This makes interacting with OpenClaw much easier.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And from here, you can manage basically anything. So, first off, let's see if OpenClaw works. Did our enthropic API connect successfully? So, it's responding. That's good.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Okay, we can see that it's using cloth set 4.5, which is a good model, but we want to improve that to Opus. So I'm going to say browse the web to find the official enthropic API name for Opus 4.6 and then update your model config to make this the primary model. Enter. The beauty of Open Claw is that it can update itself. Right?

### 🎬 セクション 17

You don't need to be sitting in this terminal and doing changes. You can just tell it swap the default model or restart the gateway. any command you'd want even like implementing WhatsApp, implementing telegram, implementing Google calendar, some of which I'm going to show you later in the video, you can easily do by just talking to it in plain English, right? So, perfect founded the official entropic API name for Opus 4.6 is clo-opus-4-6. This is important because inside of open router, for example, it's a dot instead of dash and if you have the incorrect name, it will not work, right?

### 📋 セクション 18

So, let's see. Disconnected from gateway. It's restarting right now. Missing Brave search API key. It's not a problem.

### ⭐ セクション 19

We're going to switch to Perplexity Pro in a second. It's much more powerful than Brave Search. See, done. Upload your config to use Opus as a primary model. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 20

Test. I'm going to do a test message. There we go. Cloud Opus 4.6. Now, obviously, Opus is more expensive.

### 💡 セクション 21

So, if you want to save cost, you can stick to Sonet already a great model. Or you can even connect your CHBD subscription if you're paying 20 bucks a month for CHBD Plus or $200 a month for CHBD Pro. Later in the video, I'll show you how you can use that to power OpenClaw for free because you're already paying for those subscriptions. Now, first off, before I show you some of the more advanced use cases, let me take you through the OpenClaw gateway dashboard. So, on the left you have the chat.

### 🔧 セクション 22

This is where we are. Then you have the overview. Here we can see the gateway access token. Again, keep this private please don't be sloppy. On the left you have the different channels.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Here you can see whether WhatsApp is configured. Obviously, we haven't configured any of these right now. Here we have the different instances of OpenClaw. Here we have the sessions. any active chrome jobs.

### 💭 セクション 24

This is amazing. This basically replaces NA10 for a lot of the use cases. And again, I'm going to dive deeper into chrome jobs in a bit. Then we have also agents. You can create sub agents, but this is the main agent.

### 📌 セクション 25

You can see the primary model, identity, stuff like that. Skills. Skills are kind of the new tools. This is what's replacing tools, right? In 2025, we were talking about giving your agent tools.

### ✅ セクション 26

In 2026, we give them skills because it's basically instructions on how to use certain tools. Anyways, there's a bunch more in the dashboard, but these are the main things. So, let's go back to chat. And one of the first things you should learn is the slash compact command. This compacts your context window so that you save cost, right?

### 📚 セクション 27

Especially when using an expensive model like Opus. As you can see, we're already at 30,000 input tokens, which is not that much because Opus 4.6 can go up to 1 million tokens of input, but the more tokens, the more you're spending, right? So, slash compact is essential command that'll compact your message history inside of OpenClaw to save tokens. As you can see, we went from 30,000 to 12,000, which is basically 1/3. By the way, here you have some useful buttons.

### 🔖 セクション 28

This one is for refreshing chat data. This one is to toggle the thinking, right? So, you can see now it's more concise. Here you can see a bit more details on what's happening. Now, one of the main ideas is that open claw has access to the full VPS.

### 🎨 セクション 29

It has its own server, meaning it can store files securely on that server and you don't have to worry about it messing up something on your main computer. So what you can say is like list out all files in the workspace folder. You can see what's in there right now. Here are the files in the workspace. Agents.md, boot.md, bootstrap, heartbeat, identity, memory, soul, tools, user.

### 🚀 セクション 30

These nine files are the most important files you have to understand. Each one has a different purpose, but all of them get loaded into every single message of open claw. And this is how you do context engineering with the markdown files. Now what I would recommend you to do is I would recommend you to create two folders. creates two folders, one named personal and one named business in which we will create our own markdown files.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So this is how you manage files inside of OpenClaw. You have it create folders and you have it create markdown files in those folders with useful info about your life, your business, your playbooks, SOPs, your preferences, anything that you can verbalize. Any action, any task, there is a way to do it. There's how you want to get it done, what it means for it to get done. All of these you have to verbalize.

### 🌟 セクション 32

This is going to be the most valuable skill in 2026. How well you can verbalize your thoughts, your preferences, your judgment and turn them into clear markdown files that we give to the computer, aka to agents like openclaw or agent zero. Because if you cannot verbalize your preferences, you cannot start automating a lot of these tasks and workflows in your life. Now the way you work with openclaw is that you constantly keep improving the context in these files. For example, I can say, "Show me the contents of user.MD." Since we started this, it's obviously going to be empty, but then you ask it, okay, ask me five questions to get to know about me more.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Here it is. Still a blank template. Want to fill it in? I just need the basics. So, it ask me four things.

### 📋 セクション 34

My name is David. You should call me David. My time zone is Dubai, aka Gulf time zone. And I'm currently working on a YouTube video about open claw. Boom.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Super basic context. Took me like 7 seconds to speak out. and it's already going to be much better than before, right? So, as you work with OpenClaw, you not only improve these nine default files, but you keep adding files into the personal and business folders and building out a file structure. And this is, by the way, what I call a living file.

### 📝 セクション 36

And again, I'm going to get into that bit more later in the video. But if you're currently storing all your files on Google Drive or Microsoft Suite or just locally on your computer using Obsidian, those are dead files. And what I mean by that is that they cannot be accessed by powerful AI agents and they cannot be modified by the agents. improved by agents or used as context. So, this is a completely different way of thinking about files and managing documents in 2026 and beyond than in the past.

### 💡 セクション 37

So, if you're not used to this, you're going to want to pay attention because soon enough all of us will have different VPS servers running different AI agents, mix of open cloths, mix of agent zeros, maybe some cloth codes, whatever that agent is doing. And each of the VPS will have its own files, its own context, its own connectors, whether it's Google calendar, whether it's 11 laps, whether it's Appify, whether it's Nabana Pro. This is already happening. And each connection, each improvement you make to your Open Claw pays off dividends forever. This is what you have to understand, right?

### 🔧 セクション 38

You might say, "Okay, David, but you just gave it, you know, a prompt, a bit more info about you. What's the big deal?" The big deal is that it has it stored forever on the VPS. It's on the hosting VPS. It's not lost inside of your CH GP history. this improvement is going to be there forever.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So every hour you put into improving your open claw and making it more powerful, that hour will pay off dividends forever. So if you really are serious about AI, make sure to watch this full video and sit down for 1 hour or 2 hours and actually set up a powerful open claw that's going to be saving you many hours every single week because again the technology is here. Now another useful command you should know is / status. This will give you the status of your open claw. It will tell you the version, the current model that you're using, tokens, the context window status, and a bunch of other stuff.

### 💭 セクション 40

You can also do /hel if you forget the available commands. This will list them all out. So for the session, you can do / new/reset/compact even with instructions on what to focus on in the compact or sltop. Then you have options such as slashthink, how much of the thinking or reasoning effort the model gives. Then which LLM you're using, how verbose it is, then obviously SL status, who am I slashcontext.

### 📌 セクション 41

All right, so let's do / new to the new session. Now, the first thing I like to do when setting up any new open claw is to upgrade the web search model because if we ask it check the VPS and check your config and tell me what is the current API or current tool that you're using for web search. It will tell you by default it's the Brave search API which by the way isn't BAF, right? Like I'm using Brave as my main browser, but it's not the best. It's not a gentic search.

### ✅ セクション 42

So there we go. Brave search API is the built-in one. What we're going to do is we're going to upgrade to Perplexity Pro. Now, many of you know Perplexity as a website, right? Like a tool you go to ask questions and it's optimized from web search.

### 📚 セクション 43

But guess what? Perplexity is also available on open router. And all of these models are here. So you can literally use the Proplexity Pro models even when you're not paying 20 bucks a month for Perplexity Pro. You can just use them right here and give them to your open clause so that anytime it does web search, it uses a very powerful AI web search tool, which is what we're going to do right now.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So in here inside of open router there's two models you need to know about. Most people use Soner right this is the default peroxis search but this is this one is pretty bad. If you're a more advanced user you might be using Soner Pro. This one is solid but there's actually a better option for the quick web search. Sonar Pro search.

### 🎨 セクション 45

This is the one you should be using now for your deep research. Perplexi also has an endpoint for that. This one Soner deep research. We're going to connect DB research and pro search so that our open claw can use the latest and greatest AI web search tools for any web search that it does. And actually this is a good opportunity to show you the selfupgrading nature of open clause.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So we're going to have it change itself, right? I'm not going to be going into the terminal and doing some fancy stuff. No, I'm going to speak to it in plain English and I'm going to tell it to change that model itself. So let's start with the normal search. So in the pro search, let's copy this model name inside of open router.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Go back to open claw and say I want to change the default web search model to boom endpoint on open router. Your task is to figure out how to do this then update your own config so that you swap it so that the default web search is not using the brave search API but rather this endpoint of perplexity cylinder pro search from the open router API. Once you do so restart the gateway. Actually one more thing we need to give it is an API key right because we're using enthropic API for the model and this is a model on open router so go to top right click on keys here I'm going to create a new API key I'm going to name it subscribe if you're watching this and if you want to see more videos like this then make sure to subscribe it takes two seconds it's completely free and it helps out a lot so please go below the video and click subscribe appreciate it let's give it a limit $20 or something boom copy back to open claw I Okay, use this API key. Boom.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Again, this is not the best practice. Do not share API keys with chatbots carelessly. I'm just trying to speed it up for the sake of this video. There we go. So, it changed the schema of the config.

### 🎬 セクション 49

And then it restarted the gateway. Found exact config path. The schema supports tools web search provider perplexity with proplexity subobject for API keybased URL. Applying now done. Here's what I changed.

### 📋 セクション 50

Web search provider brave into perplexity via open router. Base model open router v1 endpoint cylinder pro search. So let's do a test. Browse the web about the new SpaceX acquisition. Then we're going to go into open router into activity and let's see whether we get a new endpoint for this.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Right. So it should be using the sonar pro search and it needs to be using it through open router which means we should see a new API call here for that model. Okay, it's answering. So let's reload and there we go. Soner pro search from open claw.

### 📝 セクション 52

It cost us 2 cents. Amazing. So we've upgraded the default web search to be using sonar pro search which is perplexity's new agentic search system. And again this is already a massive improvement that most people never do in surf open claw. But we're going to take it a step further.

### 💡 セクション 53

We're going to go back to open router and type in deep research. This perplexity cylinder pro deep research. And now I'm going to say now anytime the user says deep research, make sure to hit this model on open router. Boom. But again, do not do this for normal web search.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Only do that when the user explicitly mentions deep research. Make sure to update both tools.m MD and memory.m MD files to clearly and properly document this. Now notice what I did. I started context engineering openclaw. I told it which of the nine original files namely tools.mmd and memory.md it should update so that it remembers these instructions.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And this is a clear example of how you keep improving your open claw as you work with it and you figure out okay it's doing this incorrectly. You update some of the nine original files. Then you create new files on documentation of what to do, what not to do. Right? Okay.

### 💭 セクション 56

So here you can see the tool calls done by open claw. First it read these files tools. MD and memory MD to figure out what's the current state and then it did a right tool call to change these files to document how to do this. So if I say browse the web, tell me information about this new latest AI model, it will use the normal web search. where I say do a deep research on how this supplement affects your sleep blah blah blah it will use the deep research endpoint.

### 📌 セクション 57

So now we're using two of the best endpoints that perplexity has to offer inside of our open claw and it took us couple minutes to upgrade it and it's improved forever. I'm going to get the benefits of this literally every single day for the rest of time. So if you're watching this be very careful what you use as your web search tool because you want to be using the best tool out there. Now I'm going to say create a new /docs folder in our file system and then I'm going to say browse the web to figure out how to set up multiple different AI models inside of openclaw config. So I can easily do /opus switch between them.

### ✅ セクション 58

We are using entropic API as the provider. Boom. So we're going to instantly take benefit from the change we just did and we're going to use the web search to figure out how to do this. And then we're going to save the results as a marker file. Right?

### 📚 セクション 59

So it created workspace and I'm going to tell it save the results of this web search as a new MD file in /doccks. So now it's giving me I could have included in the previous prompt to be honest. And again this is very important knowing when to ask for web search because a lot of these things are super new right open claw nobody was talking about it even a month ago but now everyone is you know it used to be called cloudbot but it doesn't matter AI field is changing super fast so doing web search is essential for these latest tools if you're talking about like python 3 that has been out for a long time but if you're talking about new things like agent zero open claw opus 4.6 GPT 5.3 codex things that have been recent that there's not much info about them in a training data. You have to do web search. So boom, I'm going to send the next prompt.

### 🔖 セクション 60

Save the results as a new marground file so that this is forever included in a FL system. We we never have to repeat this same web search ever again. If it needs to find this, it can find this and it can reference this. Right? And now I'm going to tell it to actually update that.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Now actually execute the setup mentioned above so that I can just type /sonet to switch easily to set 4.5 and then type /opus to easily switch back to opus 4.5. Once you do restart the gateway anytime you make changes to the config or any setup you should restart the gateway so that the changes actually are applied. As you can see, it saved the results of the web search to open claw model setup.mmd clean structured reference doc. Amazing. This is how you need to think instead of launching a db search inside of chatgbt and then it lives in your chbd history and you never check it.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Why not do it on your open cloud that's running on your own vps, right? That's your own virtual private server and tell it to save it as a markdown file and then you have the results of that DB research there forever. This is a complete shift in mindset you have to realize going forward. This is how files need to be structured so that they can be accessed by our own personal AI agents instead of just laying dormant inside of your perplexity chat history or your chat GBD chat history. And let's be honest, half of the deep researches I launch within perexity or chat GBD.

### ⚡ セクション 63

I forget to check the results which again that doesn't matter if you're using open claw because you can just tell it save the result as an empty file and then in the future when you're talking about the same topic it is there. The result is there and you don't have to rerun the same deep research. So uh it did this config again. I'm I'm speaking to it in plain English and it's changing the configuration of the VPS. This is the power of a self-upgrading AI agent.

### 🌟 セクション 64

So now we should be able to just do a /mod sonet to switch the model /model sonet. Boom. There it is. Model set to set an entropic son 44.5. So let's do a test message.

### 🎬 セクション 65

And again we're going back into logs and we should see a new message for sonet because so far I've been using opus. Let's see if that the case. Let's wait for the response. There it is. The response is here.

### 📋 セクション 66

Let's go back to the logs. refresh and there we go cloth onet 4.5. So as you can see all the previous messages were opus but now if you want to save cost and easily switch the model you can do that and we can obviously do /mod opus to switch back to opus. Now you might be wondering okay David when do you use what when should I use opus when to use sonet when to use GPD 5.3 codex opus is very expensive so I would use it only for the most like creative and important tasks right so maybe at the start of the day if you're creating priorities for that day or if you're figuring out how to solve a important business problem then I would use opus otherwise sonet 4.5 is basically a cheaper opus the beauty of using GBD 5.3 codex is that it's really good at coding. It's really good at debugging and deep technical problems, but also you can connect it with your CHBD subscription and you don't have to pay for you know API calls like I'm doing with enforopic API or with open router.

### ⭐ セクション 67

You can use your existing subscriptions to power openclaw and that is also amazing thing. This is an open source project so it doesn't cost you anything to set it up. All you need is your own VPS and you could just give it full access to the server and can do anything on that server and then you just communicate with it and it's a very powerful AI agent with a full access to its own server and you just keep making it more powerful. Keep giving it more context about your personal life and your business. And again, security first, right?

### 📝 セクション 68

Don't be stupid. Don't leak your API keys. Don't connect it to mold book or these public forums where it can leak your data and it can get prompt injected. Make sure to properly secure VPS. In fact, you what you can do is let's do SL new.

### 💡 セクション 69

So, I send this prompt. Browse the web to figure out the biggest security mistakes people make with OpenClaw when running it on their own VPS. And then save the results as a new markdown file into the docs folder. Once you do give me a super concise TLDDR in here. So again, anytime you do a web search or deep research, if the results are useful and you know, you might want to reuse them in the future, just save them as a markdown file and have OpenClaw manage these folders and organize your file system.

### 🔧 セクション 70

It's this is so obvious in the future and it's kind of crazy how most people don't see this. Top three mistakes, exposing gateway to public internet. As I mentioned, don't do that. weak SSH password off enabled on port 22. All right, so I'm gonna say now analyze our VPS and tell me how exposed we are.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Be concise. So again, you can use open claw to secure your VPS and to make your own open claw instance more secure. And this is really the idea of giving an agent full computer. It can do anything. And as you can see, I'm not approving commands.

### 💭 セクション 72

This is the biggest difference between using claw code, open code. These agents are running on your computer. you have to constantly approve them, monitor them, making sure that they don't mess stuff up. Open Claw is in its own VPS, right? I haven't approved a single thing.

### 📌 セクション 73

It just does whatever it wants to do. And this really gets more and more powerful as AI models get more and more powerful because they are faster than humans. They're more competent than humans at a lot of different things soon enough on everything. And us humans would just be slowing them down if you have to approve everything, right? So, let's see.

### ✅ セクション 74

Again, this is a fresh VPS, so I don't expect it to be fully secured, but let's see what it said. It ran a bunch of caramel commands. Basically acting like a cyber security expert, analyzing my whole VPS to see what's exposed and what's good. Look at how many things it did. Here's the answer.

### 📚 セクション 75

Security status, moderate risk, good gateway, low cost only, running as node user, version patch. By the way, this is uh the benefit of using Hostinger. They did a lot of this securing for us, right? So I didn't do this. It just came with the hosting pre-installed instance.

### 🔖 セクション 76

Critical issue. Alo secure off truth allows token only off over HTTP without device identity. Okay. So here are some things we should probably address. But yeah, the more data you give it, right?

### 🎨 セクション 77

If you give it personal data, sensitive information about your personal life, about your business, if you give it access to your WhatsApp, your email or calendar with each level of permission, spend 30 minutes making it more secure. Right? Once a week, if you just time block 30 to 60 minutes to improving the security of your VPS and your open claw, you're going to be fine because most people completely ignore it. They are not careful about their environment variables, about their gateway tokens, and they're just being reckless about it. So, don't connect your open claw to mold book.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Don't do any of this dumb stuff. Just take it seriously, right? Be a professional, especially if you give it access to your personal and professional life. Now, this leads me to my living false theory. This is my own theory that I would put on the same importance as the theory of evolution from Charles Darwin.

### ⚡ セクション 79

And basically this is the future of how files and documents will be handled. What I mean by living files is files that live on a VPS that a powerful AI agent can access. Right? So if you have some file or document that's sitting on your MacBook, it's dead file. Unless you the human are looking at it and working with it, the file is dead.

### 🌟 セクション 80

It's useless. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't serve as context. It can be improved. It cannot be included in a web search.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Nothing. It cannot be shared to others. It's just sitting on your computer, right? And again, maybe something better is Google Drive where you can share files to others. But again, if you or your teammates or somebody else isn't looking at that file and it's just sitting inside of your Google Drive, it's also a dead file.

### 📋 セクション 82

This is the old way. From now on, with the rise of agent zero, with the rise of open claw and these very powerful agents, we're going to see the living files theory. Every single file becomes exponentially more valuable if it's on a VPS accessible with a powerful AI agent that can modify it, that can use it as context, that can share it, that can build upon it, that can make decisions from it, right? If you give it enough context on your business and the issues, like maybe you're struggling with marketing, maybe you don't know how to get more leads, right? If you describe all of that and this is why I mentioned being able to verbalize your thoughts, your problems, your taste, the situation that's happening clearly describing that in plain English into this agents is going to be one of the most valuable skills in the future.

### ⭐ セクション 83

If you do that and if you put these into files, that's the difference between AI being like, ah, cool. is a nice tool, you know, oh, I can oneshot this website. That's very nice to like, oh my god, I'm saving 10, 20 hours per week with these powerful AI agents because you give them context, context and tools, right? If you do don't give them access to anything, then it's not that powerful. But if you give them access to WhatsApp, Slack, Google Calendar, 11 Labs, Twilio, suddenly it can make calls to restaurants, web search, perplexity research.

### 📝 セクション 84

If you keep giving them access and you connect them to other agents, right? you set up your whole team which again this is second part of my living fast theory you are going to get insane the difference isn't like 2x better right beginner with a free chbd subscription and an advanced user that's running multiple open cloths what you have to realize is that the difference between the beginner and the power user has never been greater the person with a free ch subscription that thinks oh I'm using AI every day is completely delusional and they're not even using the best models right versus the person that has multiple AI agents powered by the latest and greatest AI models talking to each other with advanced context engineering, you know, described file system, you know, list out all files on our VPS. This everything verbalized into clean step-by-step markdown files that can be shared, that can be improved, that can be built upon. The difference is never greater. We're really going to see people who as a single person can build multi-million dollar companies, if not billion dollar companies.

### 💡 セクション 85

We're going to see that this year or next year's latest versus the beginner that uses ChBT the same way as Google, right? When was John Deeafer born? Like, that's not a use case. The use case is sending a voice note on WhatsApp when you're in the middle of a gym in between sets so that it books a restaurant for you and your girl at 7:00 p.m. in your favorite spot and it knows your favorite spot.

### 🔧 セクション 86

It uses 11 laps to do a human realistic voice to call that restaurant because your booking system doesn't work. That is a real use case that otherwise you would need a personal assistant for paying two three $4,000 a month and even then that personal assistant would be slower than open claw way more expensive less reliable all that stuff right so the difference has never been greater and really if you're not taking these things seriously and not building these swarms of hyper powerful AI agents with tons of markdown files aka the living files given it enough context about your personal life your personal goals your business life your business goals your team structure your operations your goals your standard operating training procedures, playbooks, systems, all of that stuff, you're simply falling behind because there are people who are spending six, seven, eight hours every single day improving their open claw, deploying multiple different open claws in their company, in their team, and they are getting ahead and they are getting ahead fast. Now, when it comes to team structure, it's very obvious, right? So, this is the agentic company structure. This is what companies that understand this will look like, right?

### 🎯 セクション 87

So, first of all, let's say you have a company with five people. Boom. Five different people at this company. One, two, three, four, five. Let's say we have a company with five people.

### 💭 セクション 88

This is what the company looks like right now. You know, five humans and that's it. Most most of your companies are like this. Well, step one is deploying open claw to all employees, right? So maybe you have one person in the company who's logged in, who's paying attention to AI, has their open claw, right?

### 📌 セクション 89

It's better than nothing, but it doesn't really compound. There is no compounding effect in here. What you need to do is you need to force everybody on your team to deploy OpenClaw, right? Just sit down, do a 60-minute call with everybody and show them how to set it up on Hostinger. Make sure that nobody gets stuck.

### ✅ セクション 90

And really, in 60 minutes, you can set it up for your whole team. But we're only getting started because the next step is taking one open claw and making it your team one, right? So, you do another VPS and you do a team open claw that everybody can access. And this guy has access to everything. You give him access to your company documents, company spreadsheets, access to financial data, clear description of the team and who's responsible for what, company goals and objectives, the current biggest roadblocks and problems in a company.

### 📚 セクション 91

Anything that a CEO or like somebody on the leadership team would have access to, right? The most important data about a company. And then guess what? This is the company open claw. And then every person with their own personal open claw has access to this guy.

### 🔖 セクション 92

So let's say John over here has his own personal open claw that knows about him and his personal life. But if John needs to do some business task, his open claw can hit up the team one, get the necessary context which again will be stored in a nice file system in what I call the living files and then John's open claw can do the task for John, right? And this really is the future because then what can happen is that John's open claw can communicate to Michael's open claw, get some data from him, maybe something that isn't in the main one. Or Michael's open claw can ask Sebastian's open claw and this one, you know, has the data and it's something that should be in the company, so it's sent to the main guy and he saves it into the files. You get the point.

### 🎨 セクション 93

This is going to be insane. I'm building this in my own team within the next two to four weeks. It's that important. And every single company that is serious about AI and AI agents will look like this by the half of the year. This is not 12 months, 18 months.

### 🚀 セクション 94

This is like couple months away. The technology is already here. What matters is just building this process, right? And giving enough context to these AI Asians so that they're actually useful. So this is what I think an agentic company structure will look like.

### ⚡ セクション 95

And yeah, it's only a matter of time before every company looks like this because it's just so obvious. Now, since the context engineering of OpenClaw is so essential, let me break down each of these nine files and what you should put into each of them. First of all, agents.mmd. This is kind of the general standard. If you just go to agents.mmd, you'll see what this means, right?

### 🌟 セクション 96

This is a general system prompt that's adopted by more and more agents. Devin, codex, air, goose, gemini cli, many many companies are adopting the standard. It's basically the main file telling the agents how to behave. So for open claw you should put here any operating rules, workflows, any safety or permissions boundaries like what files not to touch or not to modify and communication rules. Next up we have soul.md.

### 🎬 セクション 97

This is like the personality of your open claw agent, right? So what tone it should have, what character and personality it should have, what values it should have, should it be pro-ch Christian, should it be outgoing, should be verbose, stuff like that. And any other behavior defaults that you want it to do. Another essential file and this this one might be the most important actually is user.md. This is info about yourself right about the human your identity context preferences essential life and work context.

### 📋 セクション 98

Obviously you don't have to go into super detail here because again ideally you build out these folders business and personal and you fill them out. So for example inside of a business and personal folder fill out create a new goals.mmd file in both of these folders. And then for my business goals, say that I want to reach $1 million per month. For my personal goals, say I want to win Mr. Olympia and create a step-by-step guide for each of these and save them into the markdown files.

### ⭐ セクション 99

Then after you do all of these steps, show me the file system again. So that's an example of how you would fill out these folders, right? We just created them. They're empty now, but you put in essential stuff. Your goals, your current problems, any research you do, any context, like maybe, you know, for business, you're tracking revenues and you can put spreadsheets of your accounting, stuff like that.

### 📝 セクション 100

any essential context which basically is anything to be honest, right? Maybe except for like some crazy government secrets or like some personal you know like if if you commit some serious crime probably don't tell that to open claw but other than that the more context you give it the better. The next essential file inside of OpenClaw that's built in and again these nine files that we're covering these are built in. Every single person has them inside of Open Claw. This is what makes them super important.

### 💡 セクション 101

You need to customize them. Is memory MD. This is the long-term memory. So anything that should be remembered, right? Durable facts, canonical ids, references, like if you're using some APIs, maybe there's certain IDs to projects or tasks or whatever.

### 🔧 セクション 102

Lessons learned. If it makes a mistake and you don't want it to repeat that same mistake again, you can send it to memory.mmd. Basically anything that you wanted to remember that doesn't fit into the other files, memory MD is the place for it. Then we have tools.mmd also very important. This is for any API tools anything that like calls externally right.

### 🎯 セクション 103

So maybe I would have like we connected perplexity deep research how to use that how to prompt it stuff like that. If you connect ampify which actor to use, how to optimize the cost of web scraping or any API documentation for any of the connected tools, right? any gotchas, any weirded documentation or you know there's APIs that literally have a inverted order than the UI. So there is stuff like that tools. MD you would put it to know how to use these APIs.

### 💭 セクション 104

Maybe only do save readonly operations or maybe do this amount of limits you know don't call this API is expensive only call it once a day. Next up we have identity MD. This is similar to the soul but more practical right what's the name of the agent? What role it has? Maybe you just do one open claw for marketing, one open claw for recruiting, one open claw for product, for coding, you know, and your open claw is just a senior developer and it's only handling coding stuff like that, right?

### 📌 セクション 105

Remember the team organizations, this is still very basic. You can have multiple open claws that are in the team, each one handling different role. And that's probably what we're going to be building towards the end of 2026. This is just the obvious thing. This is like what every company should have, one central open claw.

### ✅ セクション 106

And again, I'm trying to simplify this for you guys, right? Because setting up like 20 different open claws, it's not only costly, it's also timeconuming and you have to manage the context all of them, right? So for starters, every single person should have their own personal open claw. That's a no-brainer. And then just create one for the business.

### 📚 セクション 107

That's it. That's very obvious. But towards the end of the year, we'll have specialized open claws that handle specific roles just like you have people. So literally, companies are going to be like 50% human, 50% agent. Like for every you know marketing manager you're going to have a marketing agent for every programmer you're going to have five programming agents right so this is where identity MD comes into place you describe the role of this agent okay next one is kind of exciting heartbeat.mmd and actually before I explain this let me show you some trick so go to openclaw and uhuh you can see that now it updated the business and we have the goals here we have the files here and this is how you keep building right you keep giving it context same area as markdown files keep improving it.

### 🔖 セクション 108

But I'm going to do slash new to do a new chat and I'm going to ask analyze your config and tell me how often the heartbeat checks. This is by default configured to every 30 minutes. And the heartbeat is basically what makes open claw proactive. It checks again every 30 minutes by default to see if there's something that needs to be done. You know, some files need to be updated.

### 🎨 セクション 109

Maybe it's the weekend and you said on weekend message me the travel plans for my family. You know, obviously for some things a chron job is better, but the heartbeat is what keeps it proactive. It's like a ping that checks every x minutes if it's 30 if there's something that it needs to do. So the way to understand the heartbeat is this. It's a timer that makes open claw proactive as I said and every x minutes the gateway wakes up the agent, right?

### 🚀 セクション 110

So we we have the gateway, we have the agents right here and the agent reads this heartbeat.md file. This is why this file is also very important. It's checked every x minutes programmatically and it reads the contents of this file such as check my email inbox, review my calendar. Right? So maybe somebody added a new event in your calendar and the heartbeat checks it is like oh I haven't prepared my human my user for this event yet.

### ⚡ セクション 111

Let me do a quick web search prepare him save it as mark file and send him a notification on WhatsApp right that could easily be written inside of the heartbeat.mmd file as instructions and then anytime the heartbeat runs it actually does these things. So if there's nothing to report, open claw just responds heartbeat. Okay. And you never see it. If something matters, it will message you on your channel that you set up or it will take some action.

### 🌟 セクション 112

So you can see where to configure it and it's by default 30 minutes say like make it every 15 minutes. Done. Harb interval is now every 15 minutes. So it did a bunch of changes. You know again you don't have to even worry about it.

### 🎬 セクション 113

You can tell open claw to improve itself to change itself. And now it will check every 15 minutes. And this is a simple change that makes it more proactive than otherwise. But the caveat is that it's using some AI model, right? So if you're using Opus, it's very expensive to do a heartbeat every 15 minutes.

### 📋 セクション 114

So you need to know how to change it. So say change the model for the heartbeat to be haiku 4.5 instead. This is much cheaper, much faster than Opus. And we don't need a super powerful model checking every 15 minutes heartbeat.mmd file. So you can see this is what it looks like.

### ⭐ セクション 115

heartbeat every 15m haiku 4.5 and now it will use haik coup which is much more cost efficient much faster to check the heartbeat and again all it does is read the heartbeat file to see if conditions have been met we don't need a super powerful model to do that haiku 4.5 is more than enough or a great alternative is gemini 3.0 Flash. Now before I explain the chrome jobs and what makes this very powerful and how to use it, let me explain another concept which is how you can use open claw for free by utilizing your existing subscription. So basically nearly everybody has a chat GBD subscription, right? Whether it's $20 a month or 200 a month doesn't matter. Well, guess what?

### 📝 セクション 116

If you're not hitting your limit and if you want to use it inside of OpenClaw, you can easily do that. These are the steps. Yesterday I was uh spend like 60 minutes to figure this out, but I turned it into these steps so it's much easier for you. First you do openclaw onboard-off choice openacc. This will give you a URL.

### 💡 セクション 117

You just need to open it in your browser. Then it will ask you to sign in with your chbd account and you paste in the URL back into the terminal. So when it says terminal, it means like the terminal of the VSSL, right? Or a better approach would be opening up the terminal on your MacBook and then copying the command for SSH and connecting into your VPS this way. So once you get the URL, you paste it back into the terminal.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Doesn't matter which one it is. And the default model will be GBD 5.3 Codex which again you can use that with your CI GBD subscription for no other API call. And then you can set up the aliases like we did earlier for set and opus. You can have codex, opus, sonet, you can add ki as many models as you want. And you can see that these providers this is the provider name and then the model name.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Right? So open router is the provider and then enthropic opus 455. Openi codex that's the provider name and then we have GBD 5. Codex. So that's how it's structured in the JSON.

### 💭 セクション 120

But again, you don't have to know any of this. You just tell in plain English to open claw what it should do and it will do it. So inside of the dashboard, if you go to the left, we can set up chron jobs or you can just talk to it in plain English and say create a new chrome job that runs every day at 11 p.m. Dubai time reminding me to go to sleep. Boom.

### 📌 セクション 121

You can literally create chrome jobs from plain English. You can create one for checking the latest trends in your industry, right? every 24 hours, every 48 hours, once a week, whatever. You can create one that runs every morning that tells you latest priorities and gives you preparation for your meetings, right? If you connect Google calendar, you can read the calendar events, maybe read your email as well and tell you, okay, you have five meetings for today.

### ✅ セクション 122

Here's two sentences about each of them. You can create a chron job tracking your wife's period. I mean, imagination is the limit. Literally, it's whatever you want. So, sleeper mind is scheduled.

### 📚 セクション 123

And then if we go to crown jobs, we should see it. There we go. scheduler. We have one job right here and this is a sleep reminder. We can see the instance of it, the setup of it, right?

### 🔖 セクション 124

And all I did is I spoke to it in plain English. I didn't have to know anything about the chrome syntax. None of that. Open claw created it. It knows how to manage the chrome jobs and it will run every single day at 11 p.m.

### 🎨 セクション 125

Dubai time. Now create another chrome job that runs every 7 days and checks what is currently the best AI model and if there is a new one make sure to upgrade your config to that AI model. Boom. And now you just automate it open close so that it's self-improving to the latest model that comes out. As I said imagination is the limit.

### 🚀 セクション 126

Chrome jobs is basically any replacement. In the past we used to build these automations by hand. Then anytime came and introduced a powerful AI agent that you could add and it can make decisions inside of your automation. But open claw takes this to the next level. You can just tell it like ah here is what I would want, you know, figure it out and it sets up the automation and the timing by itself and you never have to worry about it.

### ⚡ セクション 127

If you want you can go to chronops and inspect it. But most of the times I just trust it because it just works. This is the power of using models like sonet 4.5 or opus 4.6. These cutting edge AI models they just work. They know what to do if you give it enough context.

### 🌟 セクション 128

They're super reliable and they work. And you can see the next run. You can see the prompt. And yeah, basically you can use these chrome jobs to automate any part of your life and business. And here you can start seeing the value of adding more integrations and more tools and more APIs to your open claw.

### 🎬 セクション 129

If you give it calendar, it can create calendar automations forever. You connect the calendar once, it can forever create automations using your calendar. Same thing with Gmail. Same thing with Plexi web search. Same thing with any type of tool software that exists.

### 📋 セクション 130

If you give OpenClaw access, it can suddenly create automations with all these softwares combined in any complex way. And again, all you have to do is talk to it in plain English. So, I think you're starting to see what I meant when I said that learning how to verbalize your thoughts and your goals and things is going to be a skill that's one of the most valuable skills in the coming years. And if you're wondering, okay, David, how can I practice that? It's by writing.

### ⭐ セクション 131

you know, writing with your hands on a keyboard, writing manually with a pen and paper, just writing, speaking, trying to articulate yourself better, that is going to be such a valuable skill and so few people realize. So hopefully you guys understand why this is a big moment in the AI space and hopefully you found this video valuable. Once again, thank you Hostingers for sponsoring it. The link to that is going to be below the video. Have a nice rested
