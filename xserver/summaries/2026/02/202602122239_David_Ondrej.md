## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

2026 is the best time to build an AI business. Yet, most people will still fail. But why? In this video, I'll show you the mistakes that kill 97% of AI companies, what founders who make it do differently, and how I would start a new AI business today. Now, my name is David Andre and I built an AI startup called Vectal and sold it for 1.8 million in just 14 months.

### 📋 背景・概要

And over the past 3 years, I've helped hundreds of different people start their first AI business. So, it's safe to say I've seen it all. Now, people who want to build their first AI business make a bunch of different mistakes, but all of them fall into these seven categories. And if you watch until the end, you'll not only know what these seven mistakes are, but you'll also know exactly what to do to avoid them. Mistake number one is slow validation.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Now, what even is validation? Validation just means, will someone actually pay for this? Will they actually give you money for your product? And if you don't prioritize validating your product, you can waste months or even years building something that nobody wants. As Naval Ravikan said, there's nothing worse than a slow failure.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, you might be thinking, "Okay, David, how do I fix it?" Well, here's the fix. First, you need to make the idea concrete. What are you building and for who is it for? And then you spend the first two hours of every single day on trying to get customers. Now, here's the fastest way to validate a product.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Don't even build it. Instead, make a landing page. describe the problem your product is trying to solve and just add a button that says join weight list. If nobody signs up for this weight list, you just save yourself three months and your product clearly has no interest. But if you do have interest, you can make money a lot faster than you think.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

For example, John, who's one of my students, managed to make 90K by selling his MVP to four different deals in just two days. And that's because he focused on validating quickly. So that's the first mistake, not validating quick enough. Mistake number two is the lone wolf strat. Now, many first-time founders have this delusion that I can just do it all alone.

### 🎯 応用例

And honestly, this is a limiting belief. First off, solo founders fail at the highest rate of all possible AI companies. Second of all, building a startup is simply lonely, right? Starting a new business, being an entrepreneur is already a lonely path. So, by avoiding any sort of group, coaching, mentorship, network, you are making it even harder on yourself.

### 💭 考察

And third, you simply don't know what you don't know. Sure, you might have experience building a business or you're a decent programmer. But whatever is your downside, whether it is you don't have marketing expertise or you're not a technical person, you simply don't know what you don't know. So even if you have the skills to do it by yourself, even if you are that rare individual that has the intelligence and the competence to do everything by himself, you would still move 100 times faster with the right peers. The third mistake that almost every single person who wants to build their first AI business makes is going too broad.

### 📌 まとめ

And here's how to spot it, right? My app is useful for everybody. Anyone could get value from this product. All I need is 1% of this hundred billion dollar market and I'll have a billion dollar company. Wrong.

### ✅ 結論

You're completely wrong about all of these. It is much easier to dominate a small market than to get 1% of a large market. And by the way, even trillion dollar companies like Facebook or Amazon did this. Facebook started with just targeting Harvard students. Then it expanded a little bit to Ivy League schools.

### 📚 追加情報

Then it expanded to other American colleges, then high schools, then international and so on. Amazon started with only hard to find books. Then they moved to all books. Then they moved to CDs. And slowly they expanded.

### 🔖 補足

But it started with a very small and very niche market. And that's because the advantage of targeting a small niche are enormous. First of all, you can be hyper specific with your marketing, with your copyrightiting, with your landing page. You know exactly what to say and you know exactly who you are speaking to. Number two, you can understand your ICP, ideal customer profile better than anybody else, which gives you tremendous advantage and a mode to protect yourself from large companies replacing you.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And number three, there's just less competition. If you go after a smaller market first, nobody else is going to be building an AI agent software in there. And again, you don't need a billion users. You need a small group of people that desperately want the results that your product brings. So, here's the fix.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Get brutally specific. Sit down for a couple of hours and write down what is your target avatar. What does your ideal customer profile look like? Where does that person live? How old is that person?

### ⚡ セクション 15

Is it a man or a woman? What type of income do they make? What hobbies do they have? where do they spend their time online? And don't just say businesses, you know, I'm building software for businesses or for creators.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Be very specific about the exact person and what stage of life they're in. Here's an infographic to help you get clear about your ideal customer profile with nine different steps. The fourth mistake I see all the time with people who are trying to build their first AI startup is that they're too slow. Simply too slow. In the AI space, slowness equals death.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, says that more startups die from not launching than from launching too early. Every single week that you don't launch, you postpone, you add more features, you are burning money and time guessing instead of learning from actual users and the real market. And here's why that is 10 times worse in the AI field. The landscape is changing every single week. There's new models, new tools, new frameworks coming out that might make your idea obsolete or may make it easier for somebody to compete with you.

### 📋 セクション 18

Next, the feature that you spend three months building can become a free API call overnight. If you're really building MVP for three months, what are you doing? There's tools like clot code, open code, agent zero. You can build so much faster. Do not spend more than three weeks building the MVP.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Like otherwise, you're over complicating. Also, your competitors don't need to be better than you. They just need to be faster than you. and get to the market quicker and then they'll start the iterative loop of getting users, implementing a feedback from the users, making the product better which attracts even more users and so on. So being fast isn't just a nice to have, it is absolutely essential.

### 📝 セクション 20

And Open Claw is a beautiful example of this. They went from zero to 150K GitHub stars in one month. This is how fast this AI space moves. If you build something that people want, your life really can change overnight. A growth like this really only is possible in the AI field.

### 💡 セクション 21

So this is what it looks like when you are moving with speed. But personally, I know multiple people who are always somehow two weeks away from launching. And you might think I'm over exaggerating, but I'm being serious. There's people who are two weeks away from launching for like two years straight. And it's always, you know, like pivot or adding some new feature or targeting a different avatar or this and that.

### 🔧 セクション 22

There's always some reason why they are two weeks away from launching and why they never actually launch and never commit to anything. And the real trap is perfectionism. Perfectionism is often disguised as quality. You keep polishing the features, you keep improving the UI, removing the bugs instead of shipping the thing. And this is very common from people who used to be professional developers, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

If you have a computer science background, if you used to be actual senior programmer, you are much more likely to fall into this trap than somebody who comes from a business background. And instead of putting it as MVP, a big reframe is framing it as a quick and dirty prototype. If you need to make it quick, it's going to be dirty. It's going to be buggy, but you need to release it and either validate or invalidate the product ASAP. So set a real deadline for when you're finished, when you're going to launch and stick to it, no matter how buggy or unpolished your product is.

### 💭 セクション 24

The fifth mistake that a lot of you are probably going to make is bad pricing. First-time founders are always so scared to charge a bit more money and they make everything $20 a month subscription. Like literally always. Now, you have to realize that you are not JBD. You don't have billions of dollars to burn.

### 📌 セクション 25

For a lot of you, the goal is to just hit 10,000 a month, 20,000 a month. And if you really want to hit $20,000 a month in income, you have to realize go with the path of least resistance. If you charge $20 a month, you need 1,000 different paying users to hit 20K a month. But instead, if you charge $3,000 upfront and then $300 a month retainer, all you need is seven clients. And by the way, that is way easier to get than 1,000 different paying users.

### ✅ セクション 26

And yes, I'm speaking from experience, but I've also seen this with many of my students. For example, Andy made 170K with just one email. This is what's possible if you ask for more. 170K that will require no one except for him his AI powered software and his time. That is literally the goal.

### 📚 セクション 27

Now you might think, "Okay, David, but I don't think my product or service is worth it charging more money." If that's the case, you need to make your offer a lot better so that it is worth more money. And if you want to know how to do that, just read this book from Hormosi. It's a great book. It's like couple bucks everywhere, Amazon or Audible. And this will teach you how to actually make an offer that is worth paying more money.

### 🔖 セクション 28

For example, instead of building generic software, build something specific. Add personalized onboarding. Add technical support and charge what it's worth. Yes, these things are not scalable, but at the start, your issue is not scalability. Your issue that you have zero paying users.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So add in some components that are not scalable. Charge way more money and just focus on getting to that $10,000 a month, $20,000 a month checkpoint as fast as possible. Now, ideally go B2B if you can, right? B2B stands for businessto business. It basically means that you're selling your software to businesses instead of consumers.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Now, there are many advantages of selling B2B, but here are the three main ones. First off, businesses pay on time. Second, they stay with you longer, aka you have smaller churn. And third, they have higher budgets, so you can charge way more for the same software than you can if you're selling it to consumers. Just one solid B2B contract can be worth more than hundreds of consumer subscriptions with a fraction of the support cost and usually with a fraction of your time.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So yeah, basically all of you watching should be charging more money. Mistake number six, lack of promotion. Nearly everyone who wants to build an AI business is guilty of this. You hide yourself in the code, you keep building, you keep adding features, and you confuse this with progress. Yet nobody knows that your product even exists.

### 🌟 セクション 32

A shocking number of founders that I talk to build endlessly and never promote. And the reason for this is that it's easy. It feels fun using cloud code, cursor, codecs, and building and building, adding features, improving your product, but you're avoiding the most important thing. And yes, distribution is just as important as the product, if not more important. Let's be honest, how many of us know a shitty business that still makes boatloads of money just because they have great marketing and great sales?

### 🎬 セクション 33

Yet, there are plenty of businesses that have great service and great product that nobody knows about because their distribution sucks. Now, you don't need perfect content. All you need is consistency. Even with less than 100 followers, you can make sales if you're going specific with your content. And again, let me prove this to you.

### 📋 セクション 34

Patrick, one of my students, literally closed an $8,000 deal with his YouTube channel when he had around 30 subscribers. That's right. A single video. 30 subscribers. $8,000.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So, what you need to do is you need to make promotion a daily habit. Choose one distribution channel. Either YouTube, either Twitter, either LinkedIn. Don't do multiple. Okay?

### 📝 セクション 36

Don't be one of these people who are trying to figure out five things at once. If you still haven't figured out a single one, it's completely delusional thinking that you can figure out five different distribution channels at once. So, pick one. YouTube or Twitter. These two are the main ones.

### 💡 セクション 37

pick one of them and spend the first 60 minutes of every single day promoting your product on that channel. So on YouTube, it would mean making a long form video. On Twitter, it means making some posts, responding under other people's posts in your industry or writing Twitter articles. This is super untapped, by the way. Twitter articles feels like Tik Tok in the early days.

### 🔧 セクション 38

If all of you are not writing at least one X article per day, you're missing out big time. And again, you will not go viral on the first day. you will not get millions of views. All you need to do is put in the reps. Just like in the gym, you first need the habit of going to the gym before worrying about your technique.

### 🎯 セクション 39

If you go to the gym once a month, you don't need to worry about your technique. Now, I'm serious about this. You need to do this no matter what. Now, yes, you can keep working on the product. And you should you should keep making your product better, but the first 60 minutes of the day should be spent on distribution, and you'll just out compete everybody else.

### 💭 セクション 40

Mistake number seven, having no mode. Now, if you've never heard of the term mode, it's the thing that stops someone else from copying you overnight. It's what makes your customers stay even when a cheaper alternative shows up. Without a mode, you're like the sand castle waiting for the next wave to swoop you right off the beach. So, here's how to actually get a mode.

### 📌 セクション 41

First of all, proprietary data. The more users you have, the smarter your product gets. Second, deep workflow integrations. If you already plug in your tool into products that people use, then it's harder to replace you, right? Look what open cloud did with WhatsApp, Telegram and all these integrations.

### ✅ セクション 42

Next up, tailor UX. Building a good user interface and having nice UX can be a mode by itself. Think about perplexity. In the early days, it was just a wrapper of GPT. Same thing with the new Codex app, by the way, from OpenAI.

### 📚 セクション 43

The reason why this is going viral and growing super fast is because it's a nicer user interface than the previous CEX, right? Next up, having some community. Building a personal brand, growing a Discord server, starting a school community, whatever it is, having some sort of network or community can definitely be a mode. Next up, fine-tune models, right? If you fine-tune version of Llama or Quen or GLM because most people don't know how to fine-tune models and even those that do usually don't have a good data set.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So if you can do this and then serve that model faster and create a model that is better than even the cutting edge models because you have a great data set and you put it in nice UI that could be a real mode that's hard to replace. Switching costs is another way to get mode right building an ecosystem. This is why you see like Google or Facebook releasing some things for free to making them open source so that people build on top of them, right? And then there's a switching cost. Like for example, iOS, the Apple ecosystem is notoriously powerful and difficult to escape.

### 🎨 セクション 45

And that's how Apple build a mode. So your mode isn't the AI, it's everything you built around it. The data, the workflows, the ecosystem, the understanding of the user. And you can just ask yourself, if openly I copied my core feature tomorrow, which they very easily can, would my user stay? If the answer is no, you don't have a product yet.

### 🚀 セクション 46

You just have a feature. So this is one of the most common worries that people have when they're new to AI, like how do I build a mode? How do I make sure my idea doesn't get replaced? And again, you either have a really amazing idea that nobody's realizing, or you have the technical capabilities to build it that others don't have, or you understand the customers better than other people don't have, or you go after a very small niche that OpenAI and Anthropic simply aren't interested in, and you dominate that small niche. So, what is actually the difference between the people who make it and the people who don't?

### ⚡ セクション 47

Well, I've talked to hundreds of first-time AI founders. And I've also talked to people like Yan Oberhouser, the founder of NAN, and he became a billionaire thanks to building NA10. And the difference is clear. The winners take massive action. The winners focus on product market fit.

### 🌟 セクション 48

The winners actually advertise and actually promote their product. The winners move super fast. The winners take risks. The winners don't isolate themselves and they seek out networks, mentors, and people who've already done it. And ultimately the winners build something that people want.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Now the uncomfortable truth is that the AI window of opportunity is closing. New tools are launching every single week and the founders who move now will own the markets. But the ones who move slowly in the next 30 to 60 days will fall behind. Guys, you don't have a whole year. The winners and losers will be decided in the next two months.

### 📋 セクション 50

And that's exactly why I built my accelerator. Now we only accept 2% of the applicants. Not because we want to be exclusive, but because I only work with serious people. Inside of the accelerator, you get direct access to me and my team. You get a custom go-to market strategy, so you know exactly how to get customers.

### ⭐ セクション 51

You also get a clear road map of how I built vectal from zero to selling it 14 months later for $1.8 million. You also get direct access to investors and a network of AI founders. And in the accelerator, I work with you closely until you hit $100,000 ARR or more. This is the thing I wish I had when I started Vectal. So, if you want to scale your AI business faster, make sure to apply.
