## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So, this is a video that I didn't expect to be making this early if I'm honest, but AGI is here. It's real and you can use it today. And I basically haven't left the house for the past 2 weeks. I've haven't gone to the gym. I've barely eaten, barely slept, and I've been here working on a generational Claude code lock in um with a bunch of my best friends in the space just absolutely obsessing over the incredible tools that we have available now that as far as I can tell from the results that I'm getting with my own business and how I'm using it there is is AGI.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, the future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed. And there's massive ramifications for this. It's on one hand quite scary to think once people actually get this in their hand where this is going to go. But all I know is that if you've been in AI, this is the bet that we made.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

This is this is when I decided to get into AI, I'm like, I know there's going to be something like this at some point. The techn is going to get good enough and it's going to absolutely take off. And this this is like the ChachiBT moment all over again for me. Um the entire like a whole new world has opened up. I've never had this much energy uh to pour into anything really.

### 📝 詳細説明

And before I go any further, if you guys are new to the channel and don't know who I am and you're wondering who this kid is who's telling you that the robots are coming and AGI is here, my name is Liam Mley and I've been building AI businesses for the past 3 years. I got into AI just after Chat GPT dropped. I've been making YouTube videos here on how to learn AI and start businesses with it. I've run multiple different companies, software, agency, education, and after all of my experience, this is what it's led up to. This feels like the the chatbt moment part two.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And this is really the moment that I've been waiting for, the reason I got into AI and so many other people did too, is this very moment to be positioned at the start when the gun went off and it has just gone off. And in this video, I'm going to share how I'm using it, how my friends are using it, and how you can also set yours up, too. If you've been watching my videos for a while, you you've been waiting for this stuff, too. You're perfectly positioned. And so while on one hand it's terrifying about looking at 5 10 years down the line, hell even three, what this is going to look like, right now it is like we need to have a party.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Like we we need to all collectively have a party because this is what we've been waiting for. And everything that you've ever wanted in your life, guys, is available now to you with this technology that exists. And I don't care if you're non-technical or technical. There is a way for you to learn what I'm going to talk about in this video and apply it to any business. I see this as essentially an an AI operating system is what I'm calling it.

### 🎯 応用例

Using Claude code to run whatever business model it is. If you're an agency owner, AI automation agency owner, AI business owner, and you watching my videos, it's a layer around that that can allow you to essentially automate your entire business. And I don't say that lightly. We've had I'm sure if you've been in a AI for a while, you you know how maybe you'll set up this new system. I might be like notion connected to to Claude and you get all excited cuz you think you're finally going to have this incredible AI system that you wanted and you pour a bunch of time into it.

### 💭 考察

It kind of gets halfway there and then it it's just limited and can't do the rest. The stuff that I've been working on here and locking in until like 2:30 a.m. waking up at 7:00 and going all over again. This stuff actually meaningfully automates and move you towards where you're trying to go, such as literally running your entire business or life from your phone. In this case, Telegram.

### 📌 まとめ

And no, this is not Open Claw. This is not Claudebot. This is using straight Claw code. So, I'm going to do a bunch of videos on why you need to completely scrap that rubbish and focus on what I'm talking about here. It's a great time to be alive and like we're going to look back and our kids are going to ask us like, "Where were you when when the the singularity happened?

### ✅ 結論

Where were you when AGI first became a thing? And like right now I'm I'm bashing away in the Claude code terminal. And like this is that's going to be like when people the first people using computers were like putting punch cards into into a machine, you know, like we are at that stage now of this. So I just want to give you guys a bit of hope and encouragement that like that you're going to feel rushed and there definitely is a rush. I mean if you look at 12 24 months from here I don't know what happens to business to the economy when people actually get access to this and are able to build businesses uh create income streams to automate things at such a rapid rate as I've been able to do here on one hand it's going to be incredible because the cost of services across basically everything is going to drop massively um and that's effectively a pay rise for everyone um when things cost less but what that does to business in 3 5 10 years.

### 📚 追加情報

I I I don't know. I'm going to do a video investigating that. But what I really want to be clear about in this video is that the timer starts now, right? Like right in this room here, you guys are going to see it in in a lot of vlog stuff I'm doing at the moment. But like there are groups of people spearheading this right now.

### 🔖 補足

And the sooner you can adapt this stuff, sooner you can understand it and apply it to whatever business you're doing or maybe you're trying to start a business. I'm going to be making content around that as well about how to use it to to start a business and get off the ground. The ones who are going to benefit the most from it right now are the people with existing businesses who are operating at scale have probably five times more staff than they need at this point with these things in mind and they are really going to be able to milk it over the next 12 18 months while the prices are still high for all of these services and yet they can massively drop their costs and increase the uh the speed at which they're able to deliver for clients. There's so many instances of how I'm using it, of how the guys who I've been working here with have been using it to just completely cut out whole sections of review loops and building custom softwares and dashboards, setting up programmatic SEO on autopilot, being able to automate video editing, ideation for once, having a full AI brain that fully understands you, your business, what you do, your tasks and projects. Like, this is real, guys.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And I'm so excited to share it with you all. I'm so excited to walk this journey with you to to getting to what like my channel's always been about is using this technology to build your dream life. And finally, it it really is possible for every single person I believe that watches this channel. So guys, take it in. Take take a moment and be grateful that you were here at this moment when AGI arrived and you have access to this information.

### 🚀 セクション 14

You are going to be able to do anything you want with your life. And I'm so so excited for you, for me, and for anyone who's willing to be open-minded and even brave to try and learn a new skill and really master what's possible with Claude Code right now. And honestly, there's there's probably too much to explain this full system, how it works, but essentially using Claude code as the engine to have full understanding of you, your business, your context, everything about you, pulling in data from all sources, understanding your workflows, and being able to create repeatable systems that Claude Code can execute on for you. uh identifying different modules and plugins like hey do you want this put on telegram do you want want it put on WhatsApp do you want to set up this programmatic SEO do you want to install the editing module what we're starting to see is we're mapping out this entire new industry of essentially clusters of of clawed code functionality that can be easily plugged in and transferred and then adapted to your use case and by AGI I mean this is the equivalent of having a incredibly intelligent human who has access to all of your business data can do everything you want it to like a literal digital employee that can be trained to do anything you want and improve itself and can be very easily scaled up. And so, because there's so much new stuff going on and it's going to be absolute chaos for the next 6 months, I'm going to be actively pushing out as much information as I can to you guys here on this channel.

### ⚡ セクション 15

I'm also going to be setting up a few other things. The main one being if you're looking to understand what this AGI is, how to wield it, how to use it to start or to scale your business or to you're a business owner, just get your time back first and foremost and then worry about scaling. I'm going to be doing a webinar which is going to be available in the description below. All the details are going to be in that link below. And there in that webinar, I'm going to be showing you a full breakdown of my system, how I'm currently running it, the key theory and principles you need to understand to wrap your head around what this is.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I'm going to be breaking down the step-by-step setup instructions on how you can build this out for yourself. I'm also going to be including the exact starter template that you need to start moving on this. And I'll be sharing some of the top use cases and some of those modules that I've been talking about that are the most powerful and things that you should start plugging in straight away. And also, if you are a member of my accelerator program, every single day, Monday to Friday, I'm in there doing workshops, talking through this, sharing what I'm learning. Each day, I'm discovering new things to build into my system.

### 🎬 セクション 17

My friends are as well. I'm just pumping that all into workshops with my accelerator because we want to be really spearheading this. And right now, we are. It's so exciting to see what everyone else is doing in the community with this. But something big is happening here, guys.

### 📋 セクション 18

we get to be part of it. If you're watching this video, it's timed perfectly. So, if you want to get into it and get started, that webinar, there's so much to show you. I have to do it in some sort of webinar format. So, it's going to be down there in the description.

### ⭐ セクション 19

I'm looking forward to seeing you guys on there. And I'm so excited for you to be able to achieve everything you've ever dreamed of in your life. Build the life you dream of this. I certainly will be and I hope you join me in doing
