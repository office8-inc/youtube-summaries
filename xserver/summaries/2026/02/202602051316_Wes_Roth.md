## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

The stock market is just melting down. The AI bubble just popped. The big tech stock crash is just beginning. And here's what caused the whole thing. The people on LinkedIn found out about Claude Code.

### 📋 背景・概要

That's a joke, but it's not too far from the truth. Let's unpack exactly what happened. So, starting in about November of 2025, just a few months ago, a lot of people in the AI tech space, the AI sphere, so to speak, most of us were kind of losing our minds over cloud code. We saw the massive possibilities there, but most people that weren't developers just couldn't get their hands on it. It had a steep learning curve.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Then Anthropic releases co-work and co-work for normies, if you will. It was the evolution of claude code, but for everybody and at the time it didn't make that big of a splash, but that was just the come before the storm because this week Anthropic released a set of tools or kind of the starter plug-in set for co-work. So, Anthropic drops 11 starter plugins on GitHub that people can use to do their work in in co-work. So, that happened January 30th. The thing that was kind of like the the catalyst, kind of the the the lynch pin that set the whole thing going was specifically the legal plug-in.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, it included a legal plug-in to do various legal work. You can use commands like review contract. So, it would take a contract and review it clause by clause against your playbook, kind of the context of what your firm does. and you take any given contract and the claude co-work would go clause by clause and it would return green, yellow, red flags depending on the severity of conflicts etc. Another slasht triage NDA.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, if you're in a position where you get tons of NDAs that you need to sign because you're dealing with some secretive technology or whatever, these basically triage them into like, yeah, standard boiler plate, go ahead and sign it into, hey, this is mostly okay, but here are a few sort of concerning points that you have to address versus, uh, this needs like a council review. This needs your your lawyer to take a look at it because there's a whole bunch of can of worms in there. There's one that did a vendor check, checking vendor agreement status, briefs, responses, etc., etc., etc. And that hit a lot of companies kind of hard. One of the biggest examples is Thompson Reuters.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It's a company that does about six billion a year providing various legal services, advice, research, etc. The entire business model is based on lawyers paying expensive subscriptions in order to get access to databases, various other research things that people in that profession need. So Thompson Reuters takes a 20% hit in like one day. it stock price drops 20%. Because this one plugin on GitHub for Claude Co-work basically, you don't want to say it completely replaces them, but man does it take a big big chunk out of what they do.

### 🎯 応用例

And the cost for it goes from I I assume very expensive. That's what they charge the lawyers probably some high fee to, you know, you're just dealing with claude that has a plugin. So it's either free if you're in on one of the plans or if you're paying API cost and it it's still going to be very very cheap. But this isn't just about legal review or whatever illegal companies. Really, what I think it made people realize is that vibe coding is no longer this funny term that people throw around.

### 💭 考察

It's no longer AI slop. It's capable of creating incredible software that is free. Free in the sense that I can ask cloud cod to generate some software for me. If you seen my video on cloudbot aka open claw, I mean you saw I was building what could be considered I don't know if it's enterprisegrade software. It's what would have been a a good SAS company, but instead I'm able to just tell Cloudbot to create for me, and it does.

### 📌 まとめ

It's customtailored for my needs. It doesn't have a high price tag. It it's made in less than 5 minutes. And if you've been following this channel, we've been talking about it for at least a year plus. I know this because just a few days ago, it was the one-year anniversary of Vibe Coding.

### ✅ 結論

When Vibe Coding came into existence, at least the word, right, when Andre Karpathy said, you know, let's call this thing Vibe Coding. That was a year and and a couple days ago. So the fact that it happened uh you know days after the anniversary is definitely ironic. And we're also seeing a lot of other tech stocks specifically ones that bets on software either produce software or invest in companies that rely on software production of software software as a service etc. So people are calling this the SAS apocalypse SAS apocalypse.

### 📚 追加情報

The fears that what used to be billion dollar companies with competitive emotes and now they're just poof they're evaporating. Of course, we've been talking about it for again a year plus. A lot of these companies that make a lot of money selling software. As AI coding gets better and better, that model becomes unsustainable. So, they either have to adapt and somehow take AI into account or yeah, maybe just cease to exist.

### 🔖 補足

Now, of course, this is very likely probably I expect it's a overreaction to what's happening. If you've been doing a lot of VIP coding, building the software, you know, there's still tons and tons and tons of issues. It's excellent in certain use cases, but there's still problems. One of the big problems is it kind of creates this ticking a time bomb for technical debt. Right?

### 🎨 セクション 13

If I'm sitting there just vibe coding everything, the entire structures of of the business, the more and more I build it, the less and less I sort of don't know about it, how were certain features implemented, what are the security vulnerabilities that are that are possible? The code that's created will often lack security scalability. It might not have the best documentation. Most people don't also ask their AI chatbot to provide the documentation to go along with everything. So there's this kind of massive and growing cost for the future, the technical debt.

### 🚀 セクション 14

This not to mention the liability of various security weaknesses that that these that this code can have. So it's not like AI coding by coding is just going to erase every SAS company in existence. But the flip side of that is that a lot of startups are getting a lot more shots on goal. Meaning they can quickly create their sort of minimal viable product, quickly deploy it, put it out there. They can do it cheaply without too much technical talent.

### ⚡ セクション 15

The cost to create a bare minimum product went from hundreds of thousands of dollars to basically zero. And when you're just trying to get that version 1.0 0 and you're just trying to get off the ground, get the first few users on board. All the problems with vibe coding, they're not the biggest concerns. You're just trying to gain some momentum, see if there's a product market fit. If the thing takes off, well, then you can figure out how to try to, you know, build everything correctly, reverse engineer it.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Yes, that that might cost more money in the future, but you also get to quickly iterate, test, see what works. And then when you catch on to something that works, then you can pour the the talent, the money, the technical resources into it. And it's not just for startups. It's for anybody. Anybody with, you know, cloud code or or open codex can start building some pretty impressive stuff with you need just a little bit of technical knowledge, but it's not a lot.

### 🎬 セクション 17

You can be barely technical and and still manage to create some pretty amazing stuff. But the point for these big software as a service companies is that while the difficult things that they do aren't going away, a lot of them do make a lot of money on very very simple software. And now that any kid can create their own versions of that simple software for their own needs, that's going to impact the companies. It's not going to evaporate them. It's not going to kill them.

### 📋 セクション 18

Not in the short term, but a lot of the high valuations they were kind of projecting long-term growth, profitability, etc. This is going to grind them down a little bit. The other kind of big important related thing that was happening today is somebody leaked the news that Anthropic will be releasing their new models. So that's Sonnet 5, which is supposed to be better, faster, cheaper, smarter than Opus 4.5. That's kind of the next generation of models, but the the smaller version of it.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And if that's the case, that would be kind of a big deal for everybody that's using these AI agents for our ability to build software. Not only do we see an improvement, but also the cost drops massively, the speed increases. And not only that, but apparently we're also going to be getting Opus 4.6, the next iteration of their big model. And we were all expecting it today. And there were some things happening behind the scenes that sort of suggest that this is the case.

### 📝 セクション 20

We're beginning to see references to those models, you know, kind of a behind the scenes and anthropics websites and API calls, etc. But something happened where we're not sure what either there was a last minute decision to not release it. that it wasn't ready for the release or maybe whoever leaked the information knew when the infrastructure was going to start changing but that wasn't the actual release date. Often times they build the functionality into their infrastructure before the release. So you can test it, make sure everything's working properly, etc.

### 💡 セクション 21

and then days later, weeks later gets rolled out. The point is 5 and probably open 4.6, they're probably coming and coming pretty soon. So it'll be interesting to see how these software as a service companies, how they survive. I don't expect a full meltdown. And I'm I'm sure this is a bit of an overreaction, but over the long hall, I would expect the valuations of these companies to start coming down a little bit.

### 🔧 セクション 22

As more and more people are empowered to create their own software, you know how it just conjured into existence for their specific use case. I don't see how that doesn't have an effect on the market. I've replaced several SAS subscriptions by building my own software using, you know, clot code, clawbot, open claw, and openi codeex. Mostly I'm using the anthropic models for coding right now. And I know that there's right now a lot of people like that.

### 🎯 セクション 23

People that are watching, you have probably experimented with that. You you might be doing a lot with it. We're like the the weirdos, the freaks. We're a little bit in front of this wave. But as more and more people realize what these things are capable of, more and more of them will choose to create their own software.

### 💭 セクション 24

If you're able to just talk to a chatbot with, you know, natural language and it creates the software that you need. Why would you pay someone else to create it for you or use whatever preset pre-programmed software they have? You might need that for enterprise cases or specific cases where security is of high concern, but there's a million use cases where something super simple is all that you need. Anyways, it's very kind of exciting and interesting to see as like all the stuff that we've been talking about for I mean a few years now. It's slowly sort of percolating into kind of like the the everyday people awareness like oh these things can code and yes they're getting to the point where they can code better than a lot of people and yeah they can probably replace some of the work that we're doing cuz remember not that long ago a lot of people would say that we're crazy because we believe that this stuff is going to happen.

### 📌 セクション 25

Today I checked my online analytics for some of my websites and realized that Chad Gypt is now one of the top referers to my website more than Bing or YouTube or or many other search engines. Chad GPT is now sending quite a lot of traffic to my website. So fun times ahead. Let me know what you think about this. If you are investing in publicly traded companies, who do you think are the winners here?

### ✅ セクション 26

Who's going to be the benefactor of all that is happening right now? Let me know in the comments if you made this far. Thank you so much for watching. and I'll see you in the next
