## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

$1 trillion. That's a big big number because billions just don't matter anymore. But trillions, trillions still count. And it might be closer to two depending on how you count it. But that's how much has been wiped from the software stocks in the last 3 weeks.

### 📋 背景・概要

Wall Street is calling this the SAS apocalypse. IBM crashed 13% in one day. Gizanthropic just announced that their AI can replace cobalt developers. Let me show you exactly what's been happening. But just let me take one second to say this.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Remember when everyone was talking about the AI bubble bursting? Do do you recall that? This isn't the AI bubble bursting. This is AI bursting the stock market bubble. If you're surprised, you were not paying attention.

### 📝 詳細説明

Okay, so really fast, let me kind of set the stage. We had tons of SAS companies as software as a service. Investors love this business model. A lot of companies in space had just tons of money thrown at them. But I think since like 2023 or thereabouts, there was this fear of seat compression.

### 💡 実例・デモ

This idea that large enterprises purchased less seats, sort of less licenses from these software as a service companies. So there have been some growth declines since like 2021 or thereabouts. So this isn't like brand new. This isn't a reversal that's happening right now. 2021 was the peak.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

It it was trending down. And then comes Anthropic with the latest models, Opus 4.5, Opus 4.6, and even Sod 4.6, which is extraordinarily impressive in its own kind of special ways. But Anthropic comes out and basically says, "I'm going to bury every one of you one by one." So February 3rd, Black Tuesday, as it's now called, Anthropic launches Claude Co-work. And specifically, the other shoe that sort of dropped was those legal automation plugins. They were launched with no fanfare, with no announcement from a grand stage that was live streamed to a global audience.

### 🎯 応用例

They just published it on GitHub in a markdown file. It was just a document of some words, some code, but it allowed various cloud models to use those documents to be able to do pretty high-tech legal stuff. Document review, risk flagging, NDA triage. We covered all of this, so we're not going to go too deep into it, but it was kind of this wakeup call for a lot of these companies making tons of money providing software as a service for legal firms. Took people a few days to kind of process this information and then boom, $300 billion just erased.

### 💭 考察

Goldman Sachs software basket falls 6% in one day. Thompson Reuters goes down 16 to 18%. One of its biggest single day losses ever in in history. London Stock Exchange Group goes down 15%. Legal Zoom drops 20%.

### 📌 まとめ

Bloomberg is saying that investors are just dumping shares that have any exposure to this. And that's when we started hearing that term SAS apocalypse. So again, Anthropic publishes not even a brand new model, not even a new benchmark. It's just a like a notepad file. It's amp file.

### ✅ 結論

It's just a markup file and just sets that industry on fire. Tons of companies start getting downgraded. Adobe Freshworks verdicts, fears of this idea of the seed compression, the fears of Vibe coding, just sort of rolling these companies over. Morgan Stanley warns about investing in the software industry. Microsoft reports $81 billion quarter.

### 📚 追加情報

Stock still drops 10%. Like that was the warning shot, the shot across the bow and kind of the cascade of events that followed. And then yesterday, February 23rd, Entropic announces that clat code can modernize Cobalt code. Cobalt code is a very archaic. It's an old language, but a lot of our stuff still runs on it.

### 🔖 補足

Other banking services, ATMs, no one really knows how it works or how to use it. I'm slightly exaggerating, but companies like IBM make quite a bit of money by just servicing it and modernizing it and updating it. Anthropic comes out and goes, "Oh yeah, Clocko can do that. Don't even don't even worry about it." IBM crashes 30% in one day. Worst single day drop since 2000.

### 🎨 セクション 13

That whole dot thing. Yeah, it's kind of like that. 95% of ATM transactions run on that code language. So this is it's a big deal. It's a big industry.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So anthropic is basically saying that AI basically flips this equation. Understanding legacy code used to cost more than rewriting that code. By the way, Friday before that, Anthropic revealed their cloud code security. That's when all the cyber security stocks tanked. So, Anthropic is systematically going industry by industry and just telling them that, hey, you guys are dead.

### ⚡ セクション 15

AI can do your job better. All right. So, if you're keeping a score at home, we've lost at least 1 trillion, maybe as much as two trillion depending on what you're counting and how, but between 1 to2 trillion in market cap. So IGV which is a software ETF so it's sort of a basket of software stocks down 24% Salesforce down 40 to 45% from the highs at down 50% the founders lost around $8 billion combined Adobe down 30 to 40% based on these news so it's down 50% from the highsome Reuters again down 20% IBM down 13% one day HubSpot docuine asana snowflake Legal Zoom. The people that are just like making money hand over fist are the short sellers.

### 🌟 セクション 16

25 billion this year alone just shorting those stocks. I no longer really actively trade stocks, but I I used to back in the days just for the fun of it. I could often predict that something bad was going to happen, that there would be a short opportunity, but I could never predict when. I was always too early. So nowadays, I don't even touch it because I can never predict when it's actually going to happen.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Brianna's channel, we've talked about this exact thing happening. I'm not saying I was right or I told you so because again, I had no idea when it would happen, but you kind of knew it was coming. So, I'm not giving you investment advice. I'm just telling you that the people that are discounting AI progress, they are crazy. Like, they're nuts at this point.

### 📋 セクション 18

As this is happening, yesterday I took some time to watch a few of the finance channels that are discussing kind of the stuff that's happening in the markets. And I got to say it doesn't feel that they're getting it. One specific analyst that I watched was saying how places like Salesforce that do CRM, customer relationship management, whatever that stands for, they're saying, "Well, that's never going away. Even if companies can vibe code their own versions of it, first of all, the older people are used to it, so they're kind of locked in." Like, I'm glad people are waking up to what's happening, but they're still not getting the full extent of it. They're still perceiving this as now there's more people able to create software.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So instead of one Salesforce, there'll be five Salesforces. Instead of one Adobe, there'll be, you know, multiple Adobe's. But the people that use Adobe, they're their users. They're kind of maybe a little bit more locked in because, you know, they know how to use Adobe. So they might not be comfortable migrating to a different platform.

### 📝 セクション 20

That old uh paradigm, as I say, that thing is gone. It's erased. Maybe it's not fully here yet, but that that's the next thing that's coming. In the last few weeks, I've used my AI agents to build out a whole site that aggregates AI news, specifically kind of AI news that that I follow that I need to know about. It runs 24/7, fully automated.

### 💡 セクション 21

It set up a GitHub repo, so it constantly is updating. It has a version controls. It pushes it to the hosting provider that it recommended. And that's the one that's it's not necessarily the most userfriendly, but it's the one that scales the best and one that's the most kind of technically advanced. I've created kind of a a fitness bot, a separate installation of OpenClaw.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Basically, it's a fitness bot. I just send pictures of my food to it. It analyzes the calories, macros, adds it, kind of tells me where I'm at, keeps yelling at me to increase my protein because I'm under the goal that it set for me for that day. Sends me check-ins during the day. kind of tracks the supplements that I'm taking, how I'm feeling, energy levels.

### 🎯 セクション 23

I have my Whoop here. So, I just extracted data from this and put it into there. So, it knows my heart rate variability. It has all my sleep information, all my fitness and movements and steps, etc., etc., etc. I got to give a shout out to Andre Carpathy.

### 💭 セクション 24

He was the one that kind of I I saw what he was building. He was building a dashboard to get him to do more zone 2 cardio and I was like I'm totally building not that exact same thing because again he wanted to create a thing to do more zone 2 cardio. That's not exactly what I'm going for. I have a slightly different approach. But you see how people that are using this stuff, we're not trying to find some app on the app store.

### 📌 セクション 25

We're not even coding up our own apps. We tell our agent, hey, this is what I want. This is the specific thing that I want. And it just builds it. It builds it with perfect functionality.

### ✅ セクション 26

And whenever, pardon if this is crash, but whenever I need to take a bathroom break, that's when the new version rolls out cuz I have a few minutes to ask it for some new features. This is what I think people are missing. That that's the capability that we have right now that non-technical people have right now. And when I say nontechnical, I mean that you don't have to code. Like I I don't write any of the code.

### 📚 セクション 27

I don't even really honestly don't even look at it that much. I probably shouldn't be admitting to that on on camera. I inspect every line of code carefully. But the point is I tell Claude what to do. It builds exactly what I want.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Whatever data it needs, it doesn't create Excel sheets or Google Sheets or whatever. It just runs everything in its SQL databases. That's the thing is I don't need to know any of it. I don't need a company that manages the database with all the bells and whistles and good UI functions and technical support because there's no human interacting with that database. It it doesn't need to make sense to a human.

### 🎨 セクション 29

The AI it builds it. It gets it and it's able to pull data at will and it can on the fly organize it into a dashboard that I can look at and if I don't like the KPIs on that dashboard or what the colors look like, I just say, "Hey, change that." And it changes it like that. And now I have a live dashboard tracking all the cardio that I haven't been doing. I I've been busy, but I'm uh I'm really motivated to start any day now. Any day now.

### 🚀 セクション 30

I promise. I told it if I miss 3 days, it can start getting a little bit like aggressive with me, a little bit rude. So I'm probably going to try to avoid that. But I think that a lot of people that are investing, they still see this as SAS software, but now there's just more people creating software. So there's more competitors creating software.

### ⚡ セクション 31

I don't think that's going to happen. I'm going to come right out and say it. The revenues that those software those SAS companies lost, they're they're just gone. If Claude can do your legal analysis for free, whereas before some particular company raked in a 10 billion a year providing that software, that 10 billion uh revenue is gone. It's not that another company that's vibe to the software is going to take some fraction of it or whatever.

### 🌟 セクション 32

That's it's just gone. Now, you know where that money is going. Interestingly enough, it's migrating. It's rotating to a lot of the kind of infrastructure and chips and inference providers. So, it's this idea of feeding the beast that eats you.

### 🎬 セクション 33

This is kind of what's happening because anthropic in this case, but we're going to see this coming from a lot of different companies. It's not just going to be anthropic, but they're providing these AI capabilities to just erase, they delete revenue for these companies. And by the way, just between you and me, later they will just delete W2 income, right? Sort of like the earned income for employees. So delete revenue and some portion of that flows into inference into GPUs go burr and not just GPUs.

### 📋 セクション 34

This time we have tons of different chips in the market. Google has TPUs, Amazon has their premium chips, etc., etc., etc. That I think will be a trend that we'll see. AI destroys demand for a particular service and more GPUs go online because AI is now handling that service. Whenever I need some little piece of software that does something in particular where it's like video editing research.

### ⭐ セクション 35

The other day I had a very airy project that had to do with accounting. It had a lot of inputs and you had to kind of balance everything. It was kind of hard to figure out what goes where. It would have taken a smart person with some sort of an accounting background like a CPA or something like that. Probably a few maybe two hours of work and I feel like they would have to be pretty like on it, right?

### 📝 セクション 36

They had to have their cup of coffee and then sit there and go line by line and figure it out. As I've told in the previous episode, I knocked it out in about 30 minutes. Not me. I was playing a video game, but I uploaded everything to Opus 4.6 and it handled everything and it did it surprisingly well. Not only did it complete that task, but moving forward, that task is automated.

### 💡 セクション 37

As more things come in, I just throw it at my agent, it already knows, it has the context of how to do that. Again, it created a little SQL database and it has all the numbers plugged in there. It's got a little dashboard that I can see the stuff that I need to see. So whereas normally I would be paying a certified public accountant, a CPA some amount of money every month or whatever every quarter to complete that task, I no longer need that service. The demand for that service has been deleted and now it's an AI agent running in the cloud completing that service.

### 🔧 セクション 38

It's it's automated and it's being served by by cloud and TPU chips or whatever it's running on. Now here's the thing. I don't think this is coming tomorrow. Again, some of this stuff takes a long time to kind of percolate throughout society. Right now, I think the latest data is something like 3% of the world have tried something like cloth code or even open cloud has got to be a tiny tiny percentage of that.

### 🎯 セクション 39

So, it's not like everyone's going to start doing this tomorrow. It might take a long long time. But if you've been using something like cloud code or open claw and you've been consistently just building out stuff that makes your life easier and automated and it gives you functionality that you didn't have before, you kind of see how easy it is, how powerful it is, and how much of an impact it could make. Especially as more and more people get on board and add their creativity to it, add their ideas to it. Especially if they put it out there as an open source project.

### 💭 セクション 40

Like for example, for my little accounting project that I've been trying to do, what if I open source it? Then everybody out there with that specific need can just take that code and it might not even be code. It might be kind of like a clawed skill, right? So a lot of it might just be text written in natural language written in English. They just download that tiny file and all of a sudden their agent can do that thing.

### 📌 セクション 41

And the more people use that stuff and contribute to it, the more and more skills are out there. Each of those skills will likely destroy some demand for some service or product somewhere. Again, not saying it's happening tomorrow. I'm saying the potential is huge, but it'll take time to percolate and for everybody to kind of figure this out. But like I guarantee you that my first draft of all my tax and all that stuff is going to be done with an AI agent.

### ✅ セクション 42

And I think the kind of the tax proposals and the writeoffs and whatever all that stuff that it does, I'm pretty sure it's going to be in the top like 1% of tax professionals out there. If you've ever been to H&R Block, you know that's not a crazy statement. So, here's the important thing to understand. Anthropic isn't just selling models. They're selling industry specific automations.

### 📚 セクション 43

Or even more precisely, they're giving them away for free. The actual automations, the skills that are needed, they're just putting out there and giving it away. And then, of course, once you have it, you probably want the best model to carry out those automations, which right now for a lot of these tasks, it's Opus 4.6 six or one of the cloud models depending on what you're doing. And I think the big thing that everyone is missing in the kind of the finance world is this idea that we here in the AI space have been talking about for quite some time. In fact, I got to give credit to the blog wait but why.

### 🔖 セクション 44

It's that idea that we think that AI AGI it'll sort of like smoothly pull into the human level intelligence station. It was less smart than humans for a while and then it will slowly kind of arrive at the station. It would be like ah you finally arrived. you're now as smart as us. That ain't going to happen.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It's not happening. If you're standing at the human level intelligence station, that train is going to blow by it and it's gone before you can even see it because it's moving fast. If you've seen the latest meter data, right, that charts looking pretty scary. That's the last video that I did. By the beginning of 2027, if this projection continues, if this rate of acceleration continues, these AI agents will be able to do one entire month of of human labor in basically one shot.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So you give it a project that would take a human one month of work to do and it goes away and does it and completes it and comes back and he's like, here you go. Currently, Opus 4.6 is at around 15 hours, right? So it's like a day or two, two days of work. And the beginning of 2027, it's a month of work, right? So a lot of people in the finest industry, they're like, "Oh, AI arrived and now it's here and it's this is what it does, and we got to figure out kind of like, okay, we got to figure out what it's doing." But no, it's not holding into the station.

### ⚡ セクション 47

It's it's it's already flying past. All right. I got to give a shout out to Satya Nadella back in December of 2024 cuz he called it. He said that the notion that business applications will continue to exist is silly, not his words, but he's saying that they all will collapse in this agent era because they're essentially just a databases with a bunch of business logic. Everybody laughed at him.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Silly sides Nadella. What does he know? 14 months later, $1 trillion just got. By the way, the next impact is going to be on the labor force. I hope that doesn't catch you offg guard.

### 🎬 セクション 49

We've been talking about for quite some time. So, Noris Bank, which is Norway's sovereign wealth fund, it's a $ 1.7 trillion fund. It has about 650 staff. It reported around a 20% productivity gains from Claude. So, that's 213,000 hours gained basically in productivity in terms of sort of human skulls, if you will, in terms of full-time employees.

### 📋 セクション 50

That's 100 plus full-time employees. Here's why that's scary for Wall Street. Because those are not like hypothetical numbers. Those aren't Dario Amade's blog posts that can be laughed away. That's not Satia's Nadella's prediction before anybody saw it happening.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Those are numbers that you can put in a spreadsheet and do a calculation. There are those are real numbers that are really affecting a $1.7 trillion fund. Goldman Sachs, by the way, is also embedding various anthropic engineers to do the same thing for them. All right, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but do you remember again, sorry, back in the days, they were saying AI bubble, when is it going to burst? This whole AI nonsense just goes away.

### 📝 セクション 52

They're saying how silly, how how stupid a lot of these, you know, CEOs of these AI labs are. They must have gone mad. They're spending so much on infrastructure. How do they ever expect to get an ROI on all of that infrastructure? Where's that money coming from?

### 💡 セクション 53

What's the business use case for these AI models? They can't even count the number of Rs in the word strawberry. How useful can they possibly be? Do you remember that? It wasn't that long ago.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It was a couple months ago. The AI bubble talk was a few months ago. Now we're here and it's clear the AI bubble is is not a bubble. It's a wrecking ball. And all the industries that it flattens, all that kind of revenue, it flows into the infrastructure.

### 🎯 セクション 55

it gets soaked up by the infrastructure meaning the AI chips the the data centers because now those jobs those products those services are now more effectively served and managed by AI one other interesting trend here is that a lot of these companies Adobe and others they've been building AI tools on top of their kind of existing structure a lot of companies are trying to figure out how to build AI into what they do into their workflows I've even seen some AI YouTubers testing stuff like open claw outs and they're saying, "Oh, it doesn't work that well." Because they're trying to have it do what they do. They want Open Claw to do that same thing. You're not going to get good results like it. The idea isn't to take AI and kind of shove it into your existing workflows. Chances are advanced AI will will break all those workflows.

### 💭 セクション 56

You want to kind of think from first principles. If you're running something like OpenClaw or one of these other agents, when you're trying to have it interact with the web through a UI, a user interface, those graphical user interfaces by clicking on stuff, whatever, it's not going to be that good. It's going to have limitations. You put it on a command line interface, give it its own kind of a terminal, and it just goes off at the speed of light. It can do anything.

### 📌 セクション 57

So the name of the game I think moving forward for a lot of companies it's not going to be to you know whatever we had before whatever legacy thing that we've built how do we sort of like add an AI later on top of it it's a complete flip in the end all UIs will look the same it'll be you talking to your agent whether you're typing or or speaking or whatever it doesn't matter you're not clicking you're not interacting with a website or or software you have your your people your AI people and you tell them what to do and they and They go and they do everything. That's the final operating system of everything. That's the operating system for your computer, for your car, for your grocery delivery, for your home automation, for your taxes, for you doing whatever designs you want to do or just whatever. It's just Jarvis shoved into everything. Just Jarvis all the way down.

### ✅ セクション 58

That's kind of like the final destination. And it doesn't mean that we're just going to like sprint there. There's tons of things that, you know, there's regulations. There's a lot of humans in the way. There's a lot of habits and company cultures.

### 📚 セクション 59

So, it's not like it's just going to flip there immediately. There's going to be also tons of wars fought around this in a sense that, for example, if you're Door Dash, you want your customers using your Door Dash agent to order food. You don't want them using their own agent and god forbid having a choice of of where to order food. So, I'm sure company's going to do whatever they can to disallow, you know, the customer's agents or maybe they'll try to do some regulation against it. But I got to tell you just judging based on my own activities in the last few weeks the number of apps and websites and everything everything that I interact with it just fell off a cliff and now most of my time is spent in one app.

### 🔖 セクション 60

That one app is well it's Telegram. Telegram because that's the thing that I used to message my agent that's sitting on a little computer over there in the corner of the room. I text it or I just speak into it and it learned to use Whisper to transcribe what I'm saying. And now I have like three or four of them in in constant rotation. Each one kind of managing one aspect of my life.

### 🎨 セクション 61

And that's not just me. Again, Andre Karpathy is kind of the person that's now almost kind of an an evangelist for it. He's saying very interested in what the coming era of highly bespoke software might look like. Meaning that everyone will build whatever they need at the second they needed to run their lives. So Andre built a cardio tracker, right?

### 🚀 セクション 62

Where his agent keeps track of when he does cardio. And by the way, Peter Steinberger, the creator of Omla, he pretty much said this like everything in the future will be an API. And we're seeing that in real time. That was a very prophetic call. So again, I wear my little whoop.

### ⚡ セクション 63

It's here. And what it does, it it keeps track of various body metrics, biological metrics, like it tracks my sleep, heart rate, tons of stuff. When I work out, steps, everything, everything, everything. If you have an Apple Watch, it's probably very, very similar. But it used to be I would have to open an app and interact with the app.

### 🌟 セクション 64

that's just gone now. Now it's just this thing that collects the data. So it's physical device and then it gets uploaded to my phone from my phone directly to my agent. My agent has the the entire context of of my life. So it's it's not just looking at that particular number.

### 🎬 セクション 65

It's analyzing that number with everything else. And it's suggesting proactively things that I can do to change a lot of things. But for example, sleep quality. and saying, "Hey, right before you go to sleep, take this type of magnesium in this amount and make sure it's like almost right before you go to sleep." Told me I'm taking too much melatonin, which I mean, I kind of knew it just I got those gummies and they're delicious. So, I just I I eat too many of them right before I go to sleep, but it told me like, "Hey, that's too much melatonin.

### 📋 セクション 66

You need to, you know, take this much." All of a sudden, I have something that cares more about biohacking me to improve my performance more than I do and it's knows more than I do and can spend more time analyzing all this data more than I can. They often say that if you want to predict the tech future, you got to look at what all the like the nerds and the geeks what are all of them doing in their spare time because whatever they're doing that's the technological future 5 years from that point and that predicts very very accurately where things are going. You could predict the internet boom, the social media, crypto. So, you don't need a crystal ball to see where things are going. What are the tech nerds doing in their free time now?

### ⭐ セクション 67

They're doing this. They're talking to their little AI agent, and they're just offloading their entire life onto it. They're telling it what to build, how to organize it, and they're letting it run kind of more and more of their life. They're doing cognitive offloading to their agents. the amount of apps and and software and websites that they're using, it's decreasing.

### 📝 セクション 68

As Andre Kapath is saying here, he's saying the industry has to reconfigure into a set of services of sensors and actuators with agent native ergonomics. He's saying his Woodway treadmill is a sensor. It turns physical state into digital knowledge. It shouldn't maintain some human readable front end, and my LM agent shouldn't have to reverse engineer it. By the way, if you haven't heard, there was this person, I think he had one of those DJI Roomba things, the the the home vacuum, the automated vacuum.

### 💡 セクション 69

And this this person, he was an engineer. He had simple engineer tastes. He just wanted to be able to control his Roomba with a Xbox controller because, don't we all? So, what did he do? He used Cloud Code or OpenCloud, whatever, one of those programs to basically hack and reverse engineer his Roomba.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Again, for that simple, humble reason. He just wanted to use his Xbox controller to move around the house. Maybe place his cat on top of it and and then use the Xbox controller, maybe. Uh, who knows? And guess what?

### 🎯 セクション 71

Cloud code did figure it out. And it did figure out that there's this little authentication token and just pulled it and allowed it to kind of create an API of sorts to be able to to control it and attach other devices to it like the Xbox controller. One tiny tiny problem. The people that created those products, they they didn't expect this because again, this is kind of a new thing. You you don't expect these AI agents to hack whatever device you just put on the market and reverse engineer it and create an API for it so that you can attach an Xbox controller to it.

### 💭 セクション 72

This is a brand new kind of era we're living in. This is a real story. Check it out. So, to this engineers sort of surprise that token didn't just allow him to control his Roomba, his robot vacuum, but uh how should I put this? All of them all of the robot vacuums of that brand of that model in the world.

### 📌 セクション 73

So he for example saw through the camera of the robot a a gentleman in Germany eating a cereal at 3:00 in the morning. He was able to basically go through and uh see inside anyone's home who has purchased that particular robot vacuum. Now this was a a good person. So he he did after I'm sure checking out for just a little bit maybe a few hours I I don't know but he did report it and the company did patch it and so that's no longer an issue. But the point here is, and this is what Andre Garpathy is saying, is that each product just needs to have an API.

No longer do we need some fancy new dashboard. You know what I mean? Like for the whoop, they have their own dashboard. And my Bose headphones, they have their dashboard with their little buttons or whatever. And and half the time they even work.

And the 100% of the time they have some stupid pop-up that wants to, you know, capture your email or whatever. Those just piss me off to no end. But the point is and again this is what Andre is saying like in the future really it should just be whatever tool or utility or or physical contraption like a treadmill or a robot vacuum just with an API and just you give that API to your agent and then your agent can now you know control the Roomba or get information from your treadmill as soon as you run it just gets that digital information and it like says okay this is what you're doing. It plugs it in into your like entire life your blood work and your goals and how well you're feeling and what you ate. And now it has this information about your exercise and it just plugs it in there and it gets your heart rate and all that stuff from whatever device you're using to track that, right?

So it just everything plugs into your agent. So he's saying he's a little bit disappointed with how slowly this progression is happening in the industry overall. I I feel like most of the industry is not even they wouldn't even understand what he's talking about. Like imagine going out on the street meeting random people and trying to explain this to them. And and that's the point like this idea of getting a website with some instructions or a manual.

Most people don't realize it, but that's archaic now. That's outdated. You want me to do it? Do I look like a computer? Have my agent to do it.

That's the final form factor. The final operating system, the the final UI is you talking to your agent and it's doing everything. That's the natural state towards which everything is going to go. And of course, they might be regulations that slow it down. There might be companies that fight the process and try to make it more difficult or or capture their use users in some sandbox of their own, whatever.

It's not going to be a smooth 100% transition. But that's sort of like where things will eventually trend to and move towards. And so the question is who benefits from that? Who survives that? I feel like we're going to see brand and new businesses that that haven't been sort of conceived before that are basically providing the services that Andre is talking about here.

all the trackers and cameras and gizmos and gadgets, all of them with a super simple API that plugs into your AI agent securely. The company isn't trying to harvest your data or or insert it somewhere in between. It just just gives it to you and it kind of provides everything and the people that are building this stuff out for themselves, they just kind of buy up the whole shop so that they can, you know, plug everything into their agent and just automate as as much of their life as possible. Anyways, I'll get off my soap box, but I'm pretty excited about this future and I hope you are too. If you still haven't started yet, try installing Claude Code and or OpenAI's codecs.

That's sort of like the more safe approach. Or if you like to live dangerously, then go ahead and try to install Open Claw. I do have a a installation video about how to go about doing that. Understand some of the dangers. make sure you don't have anything there that that you're willing to lose.

But start playing around with it because I think it'll really give you kind of a a sense of of where things are heading because as of right now there's definitely the sense that there's a small group of people that are getting it that are seeing the future right so I mean Andre Garpathy Peter Steinberger obviously right they're they they've thought through where things are going and they're they're building towards that future and the majority of people people you know like in the finance industry again very very smart people but I'm sure they're not thinking about this from first principles right they have their their ideas the stuff that they learned in the market, how things work. And again, this thing really feels like a a wrecking ball that's going to collapse a lot of those legacy beliefs. And look, maybe I'm completely wrong, but you know what? So far, I've been pretty much on a track. I feel like maybe not how fast or slow things happen, but I feel like the things that we've been expecting to happen, we were seeing them happen in in real time.

So jobs are next and then some sort of a conversation about UBI or how do we kind of transition to post labor economics both anthropic and and Google Gemini and and OpenAI I believe that they've hired people economists to kind of start looking into this problem. So that's kind of the time that I think a lot of us are nervous about. But if we manage that transition well I think the the future is going to be pretty bright for the next generation and on you know assuming we figure out the whole AI alignment thing. you know, if we get that correct. So, fingers crossed.
