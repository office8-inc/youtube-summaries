### 🎬 導入

What if we can bring back the magic of the old web? Well, here's five ways that you can. NES.css is a CSS framework for creating 8-bit style applications. Now, I wouldn't say that this is an NES vibe, per se, but it does have that retro graphics look that I love. And based off that, PS1.css takes that same idea and gives the old PlayStation vibe to it.

### 📋 背景・概要

Now, this one is lacking a lot in components, but I think that they nailed the look and feel of it. It's honestly great. 98.css. Can you guess it? Windows 98.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

### 📝 詳細説明
