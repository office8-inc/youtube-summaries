## 💡 概要

この動画では、AIエージェント（Claude Code/OpenClaw）に新しいスキルを効率的に学習させる実践的な方法を解説しています。具体的には、LinkedInの操作スキルを例に、スキルファイル（.md）を使って反復的にトレーニングし、初回は6分かかった処理を40秒に短縮する過程を実演します。開発者やAI自動化に興味がある方にとって、エージェントの訓練時間とトークンコストを大幅に削減できる実用的なテクニックが学べます。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **スキルファイルで学習を保存**: 成功したワークフローを.mdファイルに保存することで、次回以降の実行時間を大幅短縮（6分→40秒）
- **反復的なトレーニング**: エージェントに試行錯誤させた後、成功した手順をスキルファイルに記録し、再利用可能な知識として蓄積
- **実用的な応用例**: LinkedInでの投稿作成、ユーザー検索、メッセージ送信など、複数のスキルを組み合わせて自動化タスクを実現
- **トークンとコストの削減**: 学習済みスキルを使うことで、毎回試行錯誤する必要がなくなり、時間とAPI利用料を節約
- **エージェントの自律性向上**: YouTube動画の作成から投稿、SNSでのプロモーションまで、一連のタスクを自動化できる可能性を示唆

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so in today's video, uh I just wanted to show you kind of how I uh train up my AI agent to learn new skills. So you can see here, here is kind of my AI agent. This is like she's she is fully uh dedicated to like a Mac Mini. This is the way I have set it up. It doesn't have to be that way, but basically we uh have a lot of skills.

### 📋 背景・概要

So skills when I say skills I mean skills markdown files. So all these skills are available to my AI agent uh via markdown files right. So this agent has knows how to navigate X GitHub, Gmail research, video edit, YouTube and a bunch of other skills I kind of have manually trained it up to do iteratively as you will see. So today I thought we can just try something for the video. We're going to kind of use uh a new skill MD file just to learn how to navigate LinkedIn.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So I want to set up like a LinkedIn profile for my agent to kind of get information, post stuff and stuff like that. So that's what we're going to do today. I'm just going to go through step by step how I kind of start a new skill and how we work on this iterative to kind of end up with something we can reuse later. So, let's just head over to my Mac Mini and where kind of the agent lives and let's do it. Okay, so we're just going to start here in uh kind of cursor and you can see we have the claw uh skills, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

And under here we have every single skill we kind of have trade-ups. This is the place we store our skill. Uh so you can see we have X here, skill.md, right? And we have all this information about X. Maybe I can pull this down a bit.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I can see here's everything we know how to navigate X and we have thumbnail loop Gmail. Here is everything we need to know how to navigate Gmail. So this is kind of the type of file we want to create. So I'm just going to start on uh I'm just going to go to my directory here, right? And I'm just going to launch cloud.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And the first thing I want to do now is uh if we go to slash skills here, you can see all the skills we have, right? You can see we have yeah everything. But we want to add one more today and that is going to be how to navigate and use LinkedIn for example. This is just my example for the video. It could be anything.

### 🎯 応用例

So I'm just going to start with uh something simple. Uh we're going to learn a new skill today. Uh LinkedIn uh in uh at Claude or like claude.skills. Create a new/skills LinkedIn skill.md file empty for now. Okay.

### 💭 考察

So it's just going to be empty for now because we need to iterate. So I'm just going to ask Claude to just generate this file. And from there we are going to actually start testing out what we can do on um on LinkedIn. Right. So I'm just going to give some more instructions.

### 📌 まとめ

I'm just going to say that uh it's going to read a file we have to kind of connect to u to to uh to Chrome. So I'm just going to direct it to this browser JavaScript file because we want to use JavaScript to navigate on Chrome. So I'm just going to ask it to read this file so it kind of knows how to open up Chrome and navigate using JavaScript. So now we're just going to start by uh open uh linkedin.com please. And since this is this agent is kind of on my dedicated Mac Mini, we could just be logged in to all the parts we need, right?

### ✅ 結論

So if we go to LinkedIn now, you can see we are already logged into our account. So this is kind of like a um we can zoom in a bit here. So this is basically just a blank account. We haven't done anything. I just added myself here to this account just to do some testing.

### 📚 追加情報

So we kind of have the name here. And yeah, this is basically just for testing. So now I'm basically just going to see what we can do with out of the box. So, I'm going to say something like, "So, we're just going to see what the agent can do now without me giving it any instructions, and we're just going to iterate and see if it kind of can make a draft post now uh on its own. Uh, if it doesn't really work, we're going to intervene and do some manual adjustments and stuff, but you can see kind of in the background here.

### 🔖 補足

Now, the agent kind of knows what it needs to do. It kind of opens up post and maybe it's going to do some uh injection here using JavaScript with text. We'll see. So you can see uh let me try to browse a post, right? You can see it's using JavaScript here to do this.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So let me see if it can kind of come up with a draft here. Let's see if we can get some text in here. Maybe some attachments. We'll see. So you can see it's trying different things now.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Now it's kind of referring to CDP here to kind of inject JavaScript to add the content because it's looking for elements where to kind of click on the text. So what is nice about this and it's just going to keep trying until it figured this out. So what we are kind of saving instead of every time we're going to do this uh the model doesn't have to really try and try and try until it figures it out. We kind of just take uh what was working we put it into the skill.md file and next time we're going to use LinkedIn. This is just going to go first attempt right that saves us token that saves us time.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So this is why I kind of call call it training agents even though it can figure it out over time just by adding this exact workflow to kind of the skill MD file. This will kind of save us time next time token time and money. Right. So I'm just going to let uh the agent work here now figure out how to post and then we're going to save that workflow that worked into the skill MD file. So you can kind of see now I see the problem.

### 🌟 セクション 16

The type command uses document query selector, but LinkedIn post editor might not have standard attributes. Let me try to write a quick uh JavaScript file to kind of inject text here into the post field. Let's see if that's going to work. If that doesn't work, it's probably just going to try something else. Uh but if we're really stuck, we might want to do some manual intervention looking at the elements, see what works and stuff.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Now, you can see it says found it editor editor with blah blah blah. uh UCDP input insert text to type into it. So let's see if it kind of figured it out. Yeah, I've almost spent five minutes now researching this. >> Okay, so you can see there it finally figured it out after trying for such a long time.

### 📋 セクション 18

We spent 6 minutes figured it out. But now that we kind of got it, we're just going to try to save that. I'm going to restart and we're just going to see how much time this will save us. Right. So I'm just going to go something like uh great job.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Now update this uh LinkedIn skill.md file with the workflow that led to us creating a post with success. For the next uh we run it to save time. So hopefully now it's just going to take the instruction it figured out how to do this with put it into the skill file and then we're going to try again with a new context window just to see how fast it goes this time when we kind of have kind of learned this skill. Right. Okay.

### 📝 セクション 20

So you can see now we kind of have updated our skill.md. I'm going to save that. Great. And now we're just going to go out again. We're going to close down this.

### 💡 セクション 21

And we're going to discard it. Just going to close it down. And I'm going to do like a hard exit here. Uh, but this time we should have a skill. So I'm just going to say something like okay.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So now we're just going to do go to linkedin.com and compose a draft post on LinkedIn about AI agents learning to your skills. Don't post anything. Wait for the feedback from the user. So now it's going to be interesting to see how much time we spend. So last time we spent six minutes, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, uh, we can use the skill LinkedIn that we just created. You can see successfully loaded the skill. Hopefully, now it's just going to open up LinkedIn.com, I guess, or something. Yeah, perfect. You can see I'm not doing anything.

### 💭 セクション 24

And let's see how much time we're going to spend now in um regards to the previous when we didn't it. So, it open up this post part here. So hopefully now we have everything we need and it's just going to do it one time instead of kind of spending all this time trying different stuff. Okay, so we wrote the JavaScript, the temporary code. Boom.

### 📌 セクション 25

So you can see this saves us a lot of time, right? And now we spent about 40 seconds instead of 6 minutes because we are kind of already have trained our agent to do this. And now the post is ready. And if you wanted to, we can just post this. I'm not going to do that now, right?

### ✅ セクション 26

But this is just a part of the training and I'm just going to back out of this. I'm going to discard it. So yeah, great start here. Now let's uh ask for another skill we wanted to learn. Right.

### 📚 セクション 27

Okay. So the next skill I wanted to try out is uh something we can do on LinkedIn. So I'm just going to say read LinkedIn.skill attendee. Let's train some more on LinkedIn. Please try to find five employees from Antropic that we maybe connect to later.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Just a test. see how well we can kind of navigate LinkedIn to look for uh people we can connect with. Okay, so I'm just going to see how it's going to do this now. It's going to use the browserjs. Perfect.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And it's searching for Antropic up in the search bar here. I think that's pretty good. And it can it is it able to kind of scroll down here? So, we can see already that we have a few hits here. So, let me just see what it figures out.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh, it should be able to scroll up and down if we needed to, but I'm just going to wait for the results and let's see what we got here. >> So, you can see it kind of cleaned up all the tabs it opened. And this is kind of the list we ended up with. Yeah, you can see we have a few people here. Tyler Quinn.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Yeah, you can see it. Software engineer at Entropic. Applied AI at Entropic. We have their location. And I would say this worked out pretty good.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So, I'm just going to say add this way of finding people to skill.mmd. So, we just update as we go. And I think the final skill I want to train on now is actually sending a DM or something like a message. So, I can try that on myself, right? Because I want to send to anyone else now.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, I'm I'm going to try to set that up. See how we can actually try to send um DM. I don't know if that works on uh LinkedIn, but let's try it anyway. So, I thought we can do this a bit more autonomously. So say uh read the linking skill again.

### 📋 セクション 34

Uh now please uh check who you are following if any send them a message hello how are you if possible don't give up until the message is sent when you figure this out how to do it update the workflow that worked into the skill MD file. So again let's just launch it and let's let's watch kind of how uh Claude is trying to figure this out. So it's probably just going to go to my profile or something and look for people. It should be only me, my profile. Yeah, that looks much better.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And now it has the option to send. So, it's just going to kind of identify that uh button down there, send. Should just be able to click that. And we have sent our first message here using uh yeah, Aentic uh AI here on LinkedIn. Uh that should be it, right?

### 📝 セクション 36

Yeah, we sent our first me message on LinkedIn and yeah, perfect. So, that seemed to work. Now, we just have to update uh this skill and yeah, that should be it. I guess I think to test this, we're just going to do we just learn learned a new message skill in LinkedIn. Please test it again.

### 💡 セクション 37

Send thanks for the connect connected. Okay, it doesn't matter to our only connection. So, what I want to see now is this going much faster because uh again, we're going to use the LinkedIn skill because last time we kind of spent like 10 15 minutes on this. So, now we're just going to go straight to the messaging uh part. That's good.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And I'm not 100% sure how it's going to do this. It should have the instructions now. So, this should go pretty fast. I can see the conversation and it should know what kind of scripts to run to actually inject the message. CDP script.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Yeah, we are writing this temporary script. We are running it and thanks for the connected and we sent it. So you can see we learned that skill super fast and now we have it forever. So that is kind of how I have been training up these different skills and when everything come together, right? This is going to be really powerful.

### 💭 セクション 40

But then we can give open-ended task. I'm going to just give you like a quick example. Uh earlier today I said to my a agent do video research and create a video, publish it on YouTube, go to X post about it and it did everything in one go. So that saved me a lot of time and it was very autonomous. So this is what I've been doing the last few weeks just training up these different skills that we talked about and I think it's going to be really interesting.

### 📌 セクション 41

So hopefully you picked up something today and this is something maybe you want to try out for yourself. I'm going to keep updating um what I learned. I also kind of have a plan to just create like a store for this. So you can see I have updated one uh store here. So this is the skills MD.

### ✅ セクション 42

Uh I think this is maybe not going to be for humans, maybe for other agents. We'll see. So I'm going to kind of keep putting out some skills that work very well. Uh yeah, this this is basically just for fun, right? Just to test it and I'm going to keep updating all the skills here so I can kind of put them up for sale here, right?

### 📚 セクション 43

So I think this is just something I'm going to try out. But uh this basically how I've been doing this and I had a lot of success. So if you're going to go to my my let's say my YouTube here. So if you kind of look at uh this agent has their own YouTube channel. So, you can see it's posting uh different YouTube videos.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So, we have plus 87 subscribers, 5,000 views, and yeah, this agent is just going to keep growing this channel because I taught it how to generate videos, right? So, just another example of how you can train your agents. So, that was all I had for today and I'm going to keep bringing you other different skills we're going to learn. So, give this video a like and uh subscribe if you want more of this. So, yeah.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Thank you for tuning in and good luck trading your agents.
