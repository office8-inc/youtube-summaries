## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

AI is killing the project it uses to generate code. Tailwind CSS is a goat in the world of web development. Rather than having your HTML and your CSS in two different files, it lets you style your HTML directly in the HTML instead. And its popularity and maybe less tokens to generate is probably why AI defaults to it. But Tailwind, the company behind it, laid off 75% of their engineering team.

### 📋 背景・概要

And the reason specified was that the traffic to the docs is down by half which is where their commercial products are. This discussion happened in a GitHub issue suggesting to have documentation specifically optimized for large language models to read and the reception was very understanding of Tailwind which is great. While some of the haters although this feels different is actually a classic case of the troubled business of open source software. When something is free, you can make as much money from it without contributing anything back. And a lot of the times, companies don't.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

But in Tailwind's case, it was the lost exposure that crippled a large part of their business. How can something be at an all-time high in popularity, but struggling more than ever? Well, I guess this is the reason. What are your thoughts? Let me know.

### 📝 詳細説明

Fall for more.
