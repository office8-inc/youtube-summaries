## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

A lot of people want freedom in life. And the biggest superpower in being free is not needing anything. If you don't need anything, you're going to be happy no matter what. Instead of wishing for a specific outcome, like the ancient stoics would say, you wish for the things to happen the way they do happen and all is well with you. You have to believe in your ability to adapt.

### 📋 背景・概要

You have to believe that you're going to figure it out no matter what. And [music] you have to not need any one thing to happen. Otherwise, you're not going to be free and you're going to sacrifice your freedom for things that are far less valuable.
