## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So at this point you have no doubt heard about the biggest and maybe the most impactful corporate consolidation in history. We had the merger between Space X and XAI that took place a few days ago. And now this combined entity is worth something like $1.25 trillion. And there's a lot of reasons why it's important and interesting and why it was done. But there's one specific that I think is very interesting to what we're talking about in this channel.

### 📋 背景・概要

As AI is scaling up, we can't just keep 10xing the sort of power output of this planet in order to keep feeding the AI data centers. I mean, eventually that will boil the oceans, but even before we run into that issue, there's just a ton of bottlenecks on the way to that. Now, putting these AI data centers in space probably seemed like science fiction just a few years ago, probably seemed like a crazy idea just a few years ago, but now it's beginning to look more and more realistic. If you have solar panels on a satellite in space, you're getting something like eight to 10x the amount of electricity that you would from that same solar panel here on Earth. The sun rays don't bounce off the atmosphere.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They're not sort of slowed down or diffused with clouds or moisture in the air. And also in space, there are certain locations where it's never nighttime. Specifically, if you're in a sun synchronous orbit, you can kind of stay at a location where sort of the sun never goes down on you. So, if you have a solar powered satellite out there in that location or that range of locations in space, you're getting tons of energy or at least a lot more than you would on Earth. You're getting a near constant solar energy.

### 📝 詳細説明

You don't have to worry about how much space you're taking up cuz you're well in space. And as you'll see, you also don't really have to care as much about cooling. A few months ago, Google released a paper called Project Suncatcher. That was their entire premise. And they basically listed out a few technical challenges that they had to overcome in order to make this possible.

### 💡 実例・デモ

For example, one of them was how much radiation would these in their case TPUs, these AI chips, as well as all the other equipment that they would have to have on board, how much radiation would it absorb before it started tripping out. And the good news is is that sort of like the limit, the point at which it starts producing a bad data, you know, tripping if you will. The amount of radiation that would absorb on its 5-year mission is well below that threshold. So radiation not really an issue. TPUs are surprisingly resilient to radiation.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

The other thing was how do you communicate between the different satellites? The trick to really improving the speed of these GPUs, TPUs, whatever AI chips were using. Its ability to transfer power between chips is a bit of a bottleneck. Nvidia, of course, created some pretty crazy ways to link those things up to the point where it can transfer more than the the entire bandwidth of the internet at its peak, like some crazy numbers like that. But of course, if you have multiple satellites flying information, and that's exactly what they have to be, you can't just make one big massive chunker of a satellite.

### 🎯 応用例

There's a mass issue, not a weight issue, but just mass. But if you have a constellation of these things all flying information, you know what? Do you just run a cord from one to the other to transmit the information back and forth? That doesn't seem feasible. But the Google engineers had an idea.

### 💭 考察

They said, "Why don't we use space lasers? Technically just lasers, but they're in space or go space lasers." And they found that with these space lasers, they could transport enough data back and forth across these formations of satellites as long as certain conditions were met. So for example, there's a quadratic drop off the the farther apart the satellites are, right? So So the farther they get, the slower the connection speed. So they have to fly within a a certain distance of each other.

### 📌 まとめ

They can't drift too far apart. So they tested what would it take to have a formation of satellite. So they tested what would it take to have this formation of satellites flow through space and you would have to kind of control them a little bit automatically, right? Some some jet streams going back and forth just to kind of keep them all floating in roughly the same formation. And they found that that's also very realistic.

### ✅ 結論

It doesn't need a lot of energy to be able to do that and they can prevent them from drifting apart. So the transfer of data between satellites isn't an issue. There were a few other things in that paper that they've basically tested and they found that yes, this is doable. This is feasible. we can do it.

### 📚 追加情報

There's only one real big sort of obstacle to doing this right now, and that is, as it usually is, it's money. It's the cost to launch all that stuff into a low Earth orbit. So, if you're thinking it in terms of dollars per unit of energy, let's say it costs a a certain amount of money to build a power plant here on Earth and hook it up to a data center. And then you'd be able to, you know, per X number of dollars produce one unit of energy, whatever. I I forget the numbers.

### 🔖 補足

doesn't really matter. The point being is that doing that in space as of right now is much much more expensive. It's not feasible. Here's the thing. In that Google paper, they did talk about what would make it feasible.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And they specifically mention one company. That company is SpaceX. They mentioned that with the sort of amount of learning that the SpaceX company's doing and improving their product and bringing the cost down by their projections, they believe that by 2035, right, less than a decade away, those two costs would be equal. So it would cost the same amount to build data centers in space as it would here on the surface of the planet. Again, when we're thinking about it from a dollars per unit of energy sort of perspective.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So SpaceX is kind of a a big deal for driving our ability to shoot stuff into orbit. It's not the only one, but it's kind of like you could say like the main space fairing company. And now XAI, Elon Musk's AI company, which by the way has X/ Twitter. It has the social network kind of built into that. Now all of those things, all of that is getting folded into SpaceX, which is important to understand because on one hand you have the XAI company that needs that power, those data centers, etc.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And then you have SpaceX, the company that can launch fairly soon, we hope, you know, maybe within 10 years according to Google's estimations and sooner according to Elon's estimations. But this company is able to launch those data centers in space. And now that it's all under one roof, it kind of makes sense because now XAI is a built-in customer for SpaceX and Space X unlocks that infrastructure buildout ability for XAI. The other perspective from which it makes sense is that SpaceX is profitable. In 2026, the revenue is projected to hit 23.5 billion.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So, the company is already cash flow positive. Starlink now accounts for almost 80% of the company's revenue. and the Starship is entering the third version of the V3 architecture. So everything's on track for this to be a very positive move for both SpaceX and XAI, not one company. But they're set to build a self- sustaining AI data centers in space, plus spaceships plus satellite communications, just everything.

### 🎬 セクション 17

By the way, XAI is not cash flow positive yet. SpaceX is. So this also kind of solves that problem by bringing XAI under the Space X umbrella. The whole thing is now able to fund itself through the revenue coming from mainly Starlink. But as you'll see, XAI hasn't been sleeping on the job or anything.

### 📋 セクション 18

It's been growing pretty rapidly, improving itself. So definitely not dead weight just because there's so many R&D costs and cost of training that that's going into it. Even though it's not cash flow positive, it's not by any means, you know, dead weight. So, XAI is working with the federal government specifically with the Department of War. It's planning to deploy generative AI capabilities and help with various I keep want to say Department of Defense, but the Department of War helping with various Department of War infrastructure and projects, etc.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Again, kind of a big deal if you think about it. That gives them a lot of access to data that might not be available to their competition. So when this whole thing is ready to IPO, this will most likely be the biggest IPO in the history of the world. It's targeted for mid June 2026. So that IPO is expected to be valued about $1.5 trillion.

### 📝 セクション 20

Now, of course, Tesla is is not in any way, shape, or form part of that. So it's going to be two separate companies listed with two separate stock tickers on the on the stock exchange. However, Tesla did early on invest $2 billion into XAI. So now it's sort of getting some of the shares of that new entity of the SpaceX and XAI entity on its balance sheet. Also Google owns some portion of XAI.

### 💡 セクション 21

I believe it started at 14% with this merger and some dilutions. It's sitting closer to 7.5%. But now Google will own that share of XAI and SpaceX. Google I believe at this point also owns 10% or so of anthropic. So it's definitely has got its hands on a lot of different Frontier AI labs.

### 🔧 セクション 22

SpaceX had a kind of a blog post to celebrate getting XAI into the fold and a couple of things jump out at me. So one of them is that space and XAI's mission is scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars. So the idea is we're getting to the point where the Space X starships can launch millions of tons to orbit and beyond per year. So millions of tons per year and that number so launching millions of tons per year that would allow us to generate 100 kilowatts of compute power per ton and that would add 100 gawatt of AI compute capacity annually. Right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

So here on Earth very recently we just crossed the 1 gawatt of AI compute in one sort of central location with Elon Musk leading that charge as of course Colossus 1 and two I think they're on track to hit 2 GW of compute for that AI cluster and by the way that's also getting added to this merger under this one entity is those superclusters Colossus 2 as it's called but with SpaceX once this is all executed that will completely dwarf anything that we're able to build here on the planet. So 100 gawatt of AI compute per year. Kind of a a staggering number to think about. So wild times that we're living in. Let me know if you would buy dur, you know, after the IPO if you would buy this SpaceX plus XAI combo, which again includes the Colossus data centers, includes X/ Twitter.
