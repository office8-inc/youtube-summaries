## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

I hate people who sell prompts. It's the biggest grift cuz like you rob the people of learning how to write prompts. Selling prompts is so cringe. It's [music] so bad. Prompts are relevant to you.

### 📋 背景・概要

Like you need to create the prompts for your applications. You cannot expect someone else to write the prompts for you. Rather than doing that, let's just take some like prom engineering training or something like that, right? I mean, I [music] have plenty of videos on YouTube about engineering. So, that is much more efficient learning how to write prompts instead [music] of like trying to copy paste some magical mythical prompt that 10x Chi's abilities.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Like, no. So yeah, prompts and like these tips how to get paid ch pro for free. [music]
