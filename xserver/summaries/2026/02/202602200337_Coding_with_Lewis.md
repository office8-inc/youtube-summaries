## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Everyone is writing code nowadays. Mom, 85% of developers are using AI now. So the bottleneck isn't developing, it's reviewing the code, but humans have to review code, but we can streamline it a lot. So I started running Kodo on my PRs. To meet your team's coding standards, it centralizes all of your agent MD files and removes duplicate entries so that if a pull request isn't following those guidelines, it can flag it, which thankfully helps clear a bunch of PRs for me to review.

### 📋 背景・概要

I can also see which rules are getting violated the most, which helps me blow through reviews way faster and make sure that the whole team is actually following organizational standards. As the amount of code being contributed continues to climb, it's important to break through the noise of obvious pull request violations.
