## 💡 概要

この動画では、AIエージェンシーを3年以上運営してきた起業家が、OpenClaw（Claude Hub）の登場がビジネスに与える影響について冷静に分析しています。OpenClawは確かに「iPhoneモーメント」に相当する重要な出来事であり、スキルベースのSaaSという新しいビジネスチャンスを生み出していますが、既存のAIエージェンシービジネスを捨ててまで飛びつくべきではないと主張しています。企業のAI導入支援という「岩盤」上のビジネスは今後も需要が高まり続けるため、新しいトレンドに振り回されず、長期的に持続可能なビジネスを築くことの重要性を説いています。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **OpenClawは本物のシグナル**：iPhoneとApp Storeのような新しいプラットフォームであり、スキルマーケットプレイスという新しいエコシステムを作り出している
- **スキルは新しいSaaS**：マークダウンファイルでSaaSのような機能を提供できるため、開発障壁が大幅に下がり、ビジネスチャンスが広がる
- **既存ビジネスを捨てるべきではない**：企業のAI導入支援という需要は今後も継続し、むしろ増加するため、確立したビジネスを手放すのは得策ではない
- **岩の上に家を建てる**：トレンドという「砂」の上ではなく、継続的な需要という「岩盤」の上にビジネスを構築することが長期的成功のカギ
- **人間的スキルの価値**：AI監査、導入支援、トレーニングなどの人間的スキルは、技術革新があっても変わらず価値を持ち続ける

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

All right, guys. So, with the Claudebot dusts finally starting to settle and a bit of clarity uh coming around what this thing is and what the potential of it is, I've had time to play around with it myself. I've seen what other people are doing with it. So, I thought I'd come on here and try to give a bit of clarity about what I see like where this is going in my opinion, what I'm doing at my agency morning side to kind of adjust for this and what the long-term ramifications are for this um within the wider AI and tech ecosystem. If you're new to the channel and don't know who I am, my name is Liam Mley and I've been building AI systems for businesses through my agency, Morningside AI for over 3 years now.

### 📋 背景・概要

We work with Fortune 500s, NBA teams, and publicly traded companies as well. So, I do know a thing or two about this technology and how it can help businesses and how you can make money with it. So, everything I'm sharing today is based off the context I've built up over the past few years of what these new and exciting trends popping up all the time mean and how to adjust them basically without losing your head. The biggest question around clawbot open claw right now is is this noise or is this actual signal? Is this where the market is heading?

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Is there something bigger here that we need to pay attention to? And if it is signal then what are we supposed to do about it? The way I see it is that this is a big deal. Like this is definitely signal. This is something we need to be paying attention to because you don't see things just explode like that for no reason, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

This is a a clear signal that the market wants something like this. The question is, is it super relevant to us as AI business owners? Is this something that we should allow to occupy a bunch of our brain space and sort of tear us away from what we've been doing for so long? If you've been running an agency or AI business for a year or two now, is this something that you really need to give a lot of thought to? And I hope I can give some kind of clarity around that.

### 💡 実例・デモ

The most significant part about Claude Hub, Open Claw, or whatever the freak we're calling it these days, is its potential to be like the iPhone moment for AI. And I mean that by it's a new platform that you can build on top of just like you had the iPhone, then you had the app store. How many times have we heard like this is the app store moment for AI? But I think this actually is is up there. It's like the strongest contender that I've ever seen for this actually being an app store moment.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

We have OpenClaw or whatever the like name you want to use for it, the actual platform that is on the device or the Mac Mini, whatever you're using it on. That is the platform and then we have Claude Hub which is the marketplace released by the founder where you have these skills which you can easily pull in and install and expand the functionality of your personal assistant of your agent. Now, this is actually a huge deal and I think skills in general are probably the most important thing that you need to be aware of right now as an agency owner or anyone in AI because skills the way that they're set up and that that these like text documents or a couple different folders and more context or ways to call certain scripts. This is the the new SAS. This is bundling of some sort of functionality and how you can explain it to your agent just via this little description at the top.

### 🎯 応用例

So, MCP was very bloated. We had to have like tons and tons of context used up by these MCP tools. skills are very very smart in that they're these very lightweight things that just based off the text description at the top of the skill can be they're always fed into the system prompt of the agent when it's spun up or your claw bot and then when you're chatting to it it's able to understand oh this message is something related to this skill I'm going to look in and actually load all the context now so it's a much smarter way of using context than MCP was but what skills really offer is a new route into SAS and I think if you look at this as a new platform and cla being the marketplace with the app store you're going to have the opportunity to be able to build essentially a SAS in a skill and skills become SAS in a certain way. So there's a bunch of different angles you could go with it, but essentially the barrier to entry for SAS is going to drop massively because there's people who are trying to build SAS right now. You need to have an interface and you need to build your backend functionality and you have to host it on this thing and like go through all the UIUX design.

### 💭 考察

And if you're looking at this through QuadBot, you can just have a signup page. You can say, "Hey, this is a great example I think is a a skill that would be a YouTube uh video transcript generator." So using a a proper transcription method like OpenAI whisper rather than just sort of stripping it off the captions which is usually quite garbage. A lot of people are going to need that utility of being able to hey can you please get the transcript from this YouTube video but I want a high quality transcription because I want my resulting content to be good like garbage in garbage out. And so say I go and vibe code up a YouTube transcription as a service tool. I put a little landing page up and I say hey sign up here.

### 📌 まとめ

They pay $9 a month and then I give them their API key. then they can integrate the skill and the API key into the claude bot. Now they have access to this high quality transcription service. I didn't have to build out some fancy well it's probably not the best example for a UI uh needing UI being a transcription service but you get what I mean in that now you just need to build some valuable backend functionality people would want to hook into their agent. And so we're about to see an explosion of these tools because people can now just vibe code some backend functionality, put up a basic landing page, set up a Stripe integration, list it on Clawhub for some traffic and to get visibility for the application and if they can get a couple up votes, you're going to get natural distribution.

### ✅ 結論

So there is an opportunity there and I think keeping in mind that there's sort of skills and SAS and what this means for these personal assistants where that goes on the business side if these are going to be I mean just because of the security issues I think it's safe to say that there's a very clear line between this being a fun consumer tool and this being something that businesses are going to look at. So there's a considerable amount of development work and security infrastructure that needs to be put in before this is even thinkable as a business tool. uh purely if you're in this game to make money, you're trying to build an AI business, you want to tap into this opportunity and make some money, this kind of skills as SAS thing is where I'd say the the opportunity is right now. Now, the question is, should you take action on it? Should you give up the the thing you've been working on for so long to go and chase the shiny new object?

### 📚 追加情報

The best way I could sort of analogy for this would be building your house upon the sand or building your house upon the rock. You know, the the parable, the wise man built his house upon the on the rock and the foolish man built his house upon the sand. There is always going to be new stuff coming out in the AI space. This is just the latest. Like we have these surges every 3 to 6 months.

### 🔖 補足

There's a new thing that comes out. Maybe it's a nana banana model that comes out and it's way better. And suddenly there's a a big burst in and interest over there cuz there are new opportunities that you know like I talk about there's fertile planes. When you have step changes in the capability of a technology, suddenly there's this fertile plane where there's all these businesses that are waiting to be created. And there's absolutely a fertile plane that's popped up here.

### 🎨 セクション 13

The question is, is that fertile plane better than the one that we're currently on? If you're running an AI agency and if you zoom out longterm, is that actually going to take you where you want to go? My take on this is that there's a so many problems that need to be solved in the AI space. There's so many opportunities like these new skills of SAS, there's the building on the clawbot platform. But the bigger opportunity that is a lot more unchanging and ultimately going to cause you a lot less stress and and headache is the the problem that we've been solving all along which is there's tens of millions of businesses out there who don't understand AI.

### 🚀 セクション 14

They don't know how to use it. They need someone's help. They need to identify the best use cases for them and they need someone to build it and train their teams on it. There's all of that is still right there. And you can take the 99% of all the software that is out the AI innovation we've had over the past 3 years and they still need all that.

### ⚡ セクション 15

this this little 1% of of clawbot and open claw in that whole ecosystem that's that can be its own thing, right? That's going to be maybe a flash in the pan. Something that moves so quickly that the vast majority of you apart from the like most technical people or maybe like the the 18-year-old who's like been vibe coding and is really like on the cutting edge of it. You're always on Twitter. Maybe you have a chance or maybe that would be a better move for you to go into this new ecosystem and really try to establish yourself.

### 🌟 セクション 16

But for the vast majority of people who are not super technical and who can't move at the like incredible rate of of improvement that these things are going at, then it's not really the the arena to be playing in for you. You're going to get eaten for lunch by these people who are absolutely like crack when it comes to AI engineering. They're so much faster and better at building and shipping than you. So, in my opinion, the vast majority of you guys need to like keep this in mind. Understand what I've said here about the SAS and the skills and how this is all moving.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Keep an eye on that. But the house that we've been building for the past few years still needs to be built. There's still demand for this house we've been building. The pace of AI innovation and these new things coming out of the time is only going to continue to accelerate. But what is constant or what is is sort of unchanging is the fact that we have a human issue in AI.

### 📋 セクション 18

We have a training issue in AI. And the where the rubber really meets the road of hey, I've identified some opportunities. We've built it for you. Now we need to actually get it to stick in the organization and for people to use it. That's still the issue.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And like if you want to build a sustainable and durable business, you don't want to go and build it on the sand of this new thing that could be a flash in the pan and before you know it like open eyes drop something or applaud or whatever. Uh which is which is bound to happen. Let's be honest. It makes a lot more sense to keep betting on what we've been working on rather than this new thing. So I'd rather work with the devil I know than what I don't.

### 📝 セクション 20

So to bring this all home, for the vast majority of you who are not extremely technical, who are following this like by the minute on Twitter, who are super deep in that ecosystem already, if you already have been working on building some kind of agency or building a business to help other businesses through this, I highly recommend you stick to your guns here and wait until like build up your ability to work like so much more valuable skills is like how to audit a company cuz that's going to be needed for millions and millions of businesses still. how to actually deliver your development services, how to train the teams on it. These are going to be relatively constant throughout the next few years and all you need to worry about is how can I use the latest tools to help me speed up my delivery and then eventually when we get Claudebot for businesses, you've got all of these clients that you can go and roll that out to. You can add Claudebot as a service. You can build out a new income stream or offer based around it as well.

### 💡 セクション 21

And ultimately, the skills and experiences you're going to learn in AI transformation and trying to transform companies with AI are going to be much more valuable than, oh, I made a new little skill or SAS skill on Hub and I got like 5,000 stars and I made like $20,000 before like some other thing came in. And it's like it's it's building on the sand is the the best way that I could describe it. And while it is interesting and I think if you're interested, have a play around with it. I'm probably going to jump in and have a tinker around and see if I could cook one up. If you guys want to see me do that so you don't have to, just comment down below and let me know.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And I am going to be making a few more videos around how to monetize it if you were to go down that route. Um there's a few interesting plays. And after you've watched that video, maybe you'll have a bit more context around should I make the dive cuz it's like do you have access to proprietary data? Do you have a certain unfair advantage that would mean you could create a successful skill? But the thing is the the revenue earning potential is not proven for these.

### 🎯 セクション 23

It could be the new app store. It could be billionaires being made through this. But it's just such a a risky place to be playing for the vast majority of you. So, I hope you can sort of be self-aware enough to categorize yourself into one or the other. But that's my take on it, guys.

### 💭 セクション 24

I think it's really important that we keep talking about this stuff because I know it can feel scary. I know like, man, that that new surge is just like everyone's anxiety level just like freaking spikes. But we're all here. We're all in this together. The market's big enough for everyone and it's only growing every day.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, let's build our houses upon the rock, not the sand. But if you do fall into that other category, then by all means, have a crack. Uh, and I hope it goes well for you. And as for Morning Tide AI and what we're doing in relation to this is basically business as usual. Like we're sticking to our guns because we know that what we are the the lessons we're learning and the the deep niche experience we're gaining from uh the work we do with our clients is ultimately going to be far more successful in the long run than me using like you'd expect me with my distribution.

### ✅ セクション 26

I could be making all these these skills and pumping them out to you guys and trying to get you to push me up on Clawhub, but that's just a distraction at this point. It's a classic shiny object syndrome. this new flashy thing. Oh, maybe it will solve all the the issues that I've had. Maybe the reason I'm I'm struggling so much with building a business is because I'm not in this new thing.

### 📚 セクション 27

And it's just guys, you need to stay stick with the mission, man. Like, we know what we're doing here. We know why we're here. We know this massive opportunity that we've been working away on for so long. And I just want to give you guys a confidence of what like I'm not I'm not changing the strat.

### 🔖 セクション 28

I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary. I'm sticking to my guns because I have so much conviction that the the the skyscraper we're building on the rock over at Morningside, on the rock of the opportunity that we've we've tracked from from cycle to cycle to cycle and we know is going to continue to be a major piece of the puzzle moving forward. As this technology races off, we become even more valuable. They need us more. And it's it's kind of frustrating how little we get talked about.

### 🎨 セクション 29

you know, like it's always talking about the the latest models and this and this and all Silicon Valley's up here yapping about the new stuff, but I can't I don't hear any of the big pods really like bringing it down to down to earth and being like, "Hey, well, like the reason you're 95% failure rates there is cuz you don't have enough of these service providers. There's just a massive gap in the market that we are currently filling. We're the only ones there to bring this stuff down to earth and solve these tricky gnarly human issues because it's not just a technology problem. It's not just a software problem. It's human.

### 🚀 セクション 30

It's change management. It's understanding the business well enough to spot what they need. With the way the AI coding is going, we're going to become even more valuable because we're going to be the ones who can fully understand the business and do the consulting portion, carry that through, use these AI coding tools to rapidly get to actual ROI for companies. And then we do step in again and we're really needed in the training piece. It's like we understand the organizations enough, we understand the politics and dynamics that we can work within them to actually get this these systems to stick.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, we are the we are the the solution to the AI problem that seemingly no one is really talking about. They expect all the SAS startups to do it when in fact we're the ones who are in the trenches doing it. Um, and that's why I'm so confident in the rock that we're building
