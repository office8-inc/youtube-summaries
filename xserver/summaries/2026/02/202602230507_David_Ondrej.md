## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Building mobile apps has created many millionaires. But in the past, they were difficult to build. Well, guess what? Not anymore. George is an 18-year-old guy who launched his first app in July, second app in September, and now he's getting offers for 200 to 300K to sell his mobile app.

### 📋 背景・概要

And guess what? He literally said, "I don't even know how to code." In this video, I'm going to show you how to build mobile apps, even if you're not a developer, even if you know nothing about software, because it has never been easier to build one. And that's because of this new AI tool called Ror Max. is recently blowing up on Twitter. This is like 7 million views.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Crazy. And it's a AI that can oneshot any app for not only iPhone, but also Apple Watch, iPad, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro because everything is powered by Swift. This is the programming language developed by Apple. And what makes Ror Max super powerful is that it's actually powered by cloth code and Opus 4.6. And the resulting apps from Roric Max are kind of crazy.

### 📝 詳細説明

So, this is a subway surface clone, obviously, flight tracker map for iPhone. And that's just the beginning. It also created a Minecraft clone where you can generate a world with an AI prompt and then play it. Right? And look at this.

### 💡 実例・デモ

This is a 3D game created by Ror Max. Here's another example. Cloudbot, also known as Open Claw, running on your Apple Watch. And again, you're designing this in plain English software that you can run on your Apple Watch. Same day.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Here's the next one. This is a 3D game for Apple Vision Pro. Like I would have no idea how to build games for Apple Vision Pro with Ror. You've just prompted in plain English. Now before to do this you needed a Mac because you couldn't do this on a Windows computer and then you needed Xcode.

### 🎯 応用例

It's the app to develop Mac OS apps and iOS apps just to start. This is what you needed just to get started. But now it's a single website. You don't need any Mac Xcode no setup and you can just build mobile apps with plain English. Now before you needed to learn Swift programming language to build these apps, right?

### 💭 考察

Well now you just describe what app you want to build and the AI writes all the Swift code for you. Now, even when you knew how to code, knew how to use Xcode and were a great swift programmer, still publishing to the app store is a long multi-week, sometimes even multi-month process that's painful, expensive, annoying, and trust me, I went through this multiple times. With ROR, this is literally one click to install on your device and then two clicks to publish to the app store. In other words, it's hund times, probably a thousand times easier to build and deploy a mobile app now than it used to be in the past. And once you deploy your app, in the past you needed to test it with a physical device plugged into your computer with cables, all that stuff.

### 📌 まとめ

Well, now you install it directly to your device with one click. You don't need any emulators, nothing like that. And the best part is it's one prompt that builds for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Vision Pro all at once. You build software for all of these devices where you can reach billions of users in the entire Apple ecosystem. Now, when I first heard about Ror Max and I've seen how viral it's been going, I immediately reached out to Daniel, the founder of Ror, because we spoke almost year before when ROR first came out.

### ✅ 結論

And luckily, he agreed to partner on this video. So, in this video, I'll show you how to build any mobile app you want with Ror Max. Now, finding Ror Max is super simple. Just type it into Google and click on the first link, which will take you to the landing page of ROR. Now, the homepage shows you even more of what is possible with Ror Max.

### 📚 追加情報

It's kind of crazy how many different apps you can build in a matter of two, three, four prompts. But if you scroll all the way to the bottom, you'll find the chat where you can use Opus 4.6, the best AI model from Enthropic to build any app you want to build. So I prepared a one paragraph prompt. Let me read it to you guys. Build a beautiful weather app with realtime location based weather, animated backgrounds, rain particles, falling snow, sunrays, clouds, hourly and 7-day forecast, and clean, minimal Apple style UI.

### 🔖 補足

Include a built-in chat AI chat assistant that answers weather related questions. So most apps are completely dead. They lack any intelligence, right? And we could easily build some, you know, dumb easy app with Ror Max, but I want to push it to the limit. I want to see what it's made of.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So we're going to include some AI features like a AI powered assistant that can answer questions about the weather, the best time to walk today, what should you wear tomorrow, any question that you might have, especially if you're traveling to some new country and you don't know the weather conditions, right? So first creates a list of eight steps. you know, splits a large project into smaller modular actions and then does some more reasoning and again it's powered by Opus 4.6 200k context window the most expensive model obviously but the most intelligent one as So RORO, they're not trying to, you know, cut cost, use some hidden model. Like a lot of apps, a lot of the VIP coding apps, they don't even show you what model you're using, which is pretty sketchy if you ask me. But luckily, Ror doesn't have that problem.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And then it starts creating the apps. And on the on the right, we can see the preview. We can see the code if you want to. And you can see the analytics of the app. Obviously, we have zero users because we're just building it.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And I'm hands off. Ror is building it for me. I'm not doing nothing. It uh manages the whole project, and it knows exactly what to do. And by the way, if you go to the code tab, Ror gives you a full emulator here in the web.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So you don't need to install any extra software on your computer or on your phone to test these apps. Everything is in the web. And that is the magic of ROR Max would have been able to pull off is the architecture is making sure that you get these AI models and AI agents like cloud code powered by open 6 and you get them to write code. That's challenge number one. But then running and exporting, compiling all that code and showing it in a web browser.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Yeah, that is the real breakthrough here. And that's what's allowing people to build apps like this in a matter of one, two, three prompts at most. Like people who are not technical, people who are not developers, right, can build apps and have their on their phones or their family's phones, their friends phones in a matter of less than an hour. Crazy 2026, we're actually living in the future. And by the way, if you were starting this from Ror.com, just make sure to toggle the RO max button before you start building.

### 📋 セクション 18

And this builds everything in the native Swift UI, which is the native programming language to the Apple ecosystem. So again, if you want to try Rorm Max yourself and you can try it for free, just go to roorc.com or click the link in the description and try it yourself. Describe the app you've wanted to build for years and just watch it appear in real time in front of you. Right? So RO is still building.

### ⭐ セクション 19

It has been building for a couple of minutes. This is very impressive how longunning these AI agents can go. If you just rewind back to last year, agents would run for like 30 seconds, maybe a minute, and they would stop and you would need to send the next problem and keep guiding it. Now, they just run for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes until the job is done, and you don't have to really do anything. Which actually reminds me of the research that Mirror does on how long AI agents can run.

### 📝 セクション 20

In other words, task completion time horizons of Frontier AI models. And if you look at this chart, we can see that we're not only going exponential, we're like blowing up, right? Opus 4.6 6 was a massive breakthrough in this. It can run for 14 hours and 30 minutes by itself, right? So even if you describe a super advanced app to ROR, it can probably build it in one shot without you having to interrupt it.

### 💡 セクション 21

It might take a couple of hours if it's a very, very complex app. But this is a taste of the future. We will have AI agents running for days, even weeks, doing incredibly difficult tasks, you know, whole workflows like curing diseases, inventing new technology and science, building whole companies, stuff that right now you need humans or entire departments for. Soon enough, it'll be possible for agents and people have no idea about benchmarks like these and about the exponent, super exponential progress that we're currently experiencing. And I believe that this is the reason why Ror has captured the attention of millions of people.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It's because Oh, there we go. Our app is finished. It's because that this is a visual representation of what is now possible. People don't really understand what this chart means. You know, most people see it, it's like, wow, fast progress.

### 🎯 セクション 23

But when you can build entire apps for iOS, for Apple Watch, for Apple Vision Pro with a single prompt, and you can have them on your phone, on your devices in a matter of minutes, then people start to understand. Okay, so let's test it out. And actually, this didn't take that long. I thought it might take longer. It was like a couple of minutes.

### 💭 セクション 24

And we have our app right here. We can scroll down. We can see that it's based in New York. So, we have some nice animations of the clouds. 7-day forecast where it feels like humidity.

### 📌 セクション 25

Okay. Then we have the AI assistant. Look at this. I'm currently your assistant. Okay.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, let's see. Will it rain this week? Pre-made prompt. No rain expected this week. And this is being generated by AI guys.

### 📚 セクション 27

So, we have a app with built-in AI in a matter of minutes. And again, I haven't written a single line of code. All I did is pasted this one prompt. Zero interventions, zero issues. Ror took care of everything else.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Yeah, I mean the ROR Max is a huge huge step in the right direction. It's kind of crazy seeing RO evolve. You know, last year it was much in the earlier stages and it was still an impressive app. It was still the easiest way to build mobile apps, but now man, it's completely completely next level. Oh, and by the way, if you want to quickly publish this app, just click on top right publish and you get a pre-made URL.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Look at this. It's a pretty nice URL. You can just send it to anybody and boom, there's this app. To get a simple QR code which you have to scan with your phone camera, which I'm going to do right now. So, here in the Apple Store, you need to install Expo Go.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Just install this app. And this is how we can super quickly test it on the phone. Boom. There it is. It's installed.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Let's click on open. And let me scan the QR code once again. Now, we need to click open in Expo Go. There we go. Opening project.

### 🌟 セクション 32

All right. We're going to need to black this out because this is showing my precise location. Because this is a weather app, you know, it obviously needs to know my location. So, I'm going to approve it. And there we go.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Dubai 24 degrees cannot complain about February and you can see the clear skies hourly forecast what it feels like 25 humidity wind yeah means makes sense we have the AI assistance let's see if the AI works that would be pretty impressive right let's see will it rain this week you know in Dubai will this rain this week good news no rain expected in Dubai surprise surprise we probably didn't need to burn some tokens but hey I have AI in my app running on my phone and again I build this in one prompt it's a AI powered app with a nice UI, clean animations as we've seen earlier with the weather, especially with the clouds. You can see they're coming in. So, imagine what you could do with five prompts, 10 prompts, 20 prompts. Imagine if you actually sat down and, you know, spent three days building this. Really, your imagination is the limit.

### 📋 セクション 34

There's no excuse that you're not a programmer. People with the best ideas and people with the best work ethic who can actually execute are going to be the people who will dominate in 2026. Oh, and by the way, in the top right, you can see like you can switch between iOS, Android, even iPad. You know, you can build apps specifically for iPad if you want and it's very easy to test on your phone right away and uh there's no excuse. You know, it's never been easier to build apps and literally all you have to do is go to roor.com, describe what you want to build, and in a matter of minutes it will be on your phone.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So again, thank you RO for sponsoring this video, go below the description, click on the link, and start building mobile apps yourself. You're literally one idea away from completely changing your life. And if you already have an AI business that's making at least $1,000 a month and you want to scale faster, make sure to apply to my accelerator. It's going to be linked below the video as well. But again, this is only for people who already have an AI business that makes 1K MR or more.

### 📝 セクション 36

But if that's you and you want to scale to 200K AR R and beyond, make sure to apply. The link to the accelerator will be below the
