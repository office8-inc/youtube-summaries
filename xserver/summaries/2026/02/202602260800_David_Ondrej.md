## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

See, in business, you have to be willing to pivot on the spot. I was just in a podcast studio and I planned to record three videos, and by the time I finished the first video, I had like 12 minutes left. So, I was like, "Yeah, I'm definitely not going to make the other two." So, I just whipped up cloth Opus 4.5. I summarized the other two videos into one and I managed to finish it up barely. But, yeah, this is what being a business looks like.

### 📋 背景・概要

You have to pivot. You have to adapt, you have to improvise, you have to use the resources you have to get the outcome and get the job done. So if your original plan didn't work out, instead of stressing, accept that this is the reality of being an entrepreneur. Because rarely ever does the first plan work. Business is dynamic, especially in a field like AI.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Things are changing all the time and you cannot expect everything to go right and you have to expect the unexpected.
