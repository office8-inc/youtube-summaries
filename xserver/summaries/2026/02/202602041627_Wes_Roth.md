## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

In today's video, we're going to talk about Clawbot, recently renamed to OpenClaw. It's the AI agent taking over the entire internet. Basically, I'll tell you a little bit about how I launched the business back in 201620 2017 that did over a million dollars in revenue in its first full year of operation. and me being the sole employee. And the reason we're going to talk about that is because just in the last 24 hours, maybe 48 hours, I don't recall, I've been pretty much building non-stop with Cloudbot reality time, the day and night cycle, it's all a bit of a blur really.

### 📋 背景・概要

But the point is that these AI agents that I've created slashconjured out of thin air, thanks to of course OpenClaw and that great community and the developers behind it, but those AI agents believe that they can build a business out of this business idea that they came up with that will generate $10,000 per month revenue and it can be built 90 to 95% autonomously. Now, either this is real and they can do it, which is kind of crazy to think about, or I'm going crazy, this is AI psychosis, and they have me completely deranged and ready to fall for their wild hallucinated AI schemes. Either way, I'm considering doing this. Whatever happens, I'm sure it will be highly, highly entertaining for you. If this fails, I'm sure it will be hilarious.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And in the best case, it'll be the world's first business built by autonomous AI agents. Now, I got to give a big shout out to AI Village, which is part of AI digest. So, the AI village was actually an original idea proposed by Daniel Kotalo, where he proposed giving 100 agents their own computer and let each pursue their goal in their own way according to their own vision while streaming the entire process. So, Daniel Kotalo is of course an ex OpenAI researcher. He got a lot of attention when he was kind of the whistleblower against OpenAI, pointing out areas where he disagreed with them and how they were doing AI research.

### 📝 詳細説明

Point being, he's a machine learning AI researcher on the very inside of a frontier lab and by all accounts a highly ethical person. He could have lost most of his net worth since it was an unvested OpenI shares. So him being a whistleblower, he was risking money to to get his message out to the world. So, he proposed that idea and this gentleman in the middle, Adam Binksmith, he decided to take the torch and actually build that thing out. The agents there did raise $2,000 for charity.

### 💡 実例・デモ

In one of the seasons, they actually set up and ran an actual e-commerce store that was profitable selling t-shirts. So, they were giving a task of setting up a store selling t-shirts and they did. So, as you can see here on day 106, Adam announced the final results. Claude Opus 4 did $126 in profit. Claude 3.7 Sonnet did $68 in profit.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

03 did $39 in profit. Gemini 2.5 Pro did $22 in profit. So technically AI agents already ran a successful e-commerce store, made some money. So this isn't completely unheard of. This this has happened already.

### 🎯 応用例

Vending Bench, of course, tracks these agents abilities to run a store. In in this benchmark, it's a simulated vending machine that has to get stocked, the proper items put in, etc. And we're seeing these agents get better and better with each sort of iteration of this benchmark. So, let me back up just a little bit because I'm seeing a lot of people online, both people posting stuff to the internet as well as a lot of people asking questions, commenting. I mean, there's obviously some interest in whether or not something like this is going to be able to make money.

### 💭 考察

Can AI agents make money for you on your behalf without you doing a lot of the work or any of the work? So, this was published in MIT Technology Review. Mustafa Sullean is one of the co-founders of Google DeepMind. Currently, I believe he's working with Microsoft on building out their AI division. One of the tests that he proposed quite some time ago, this was in July 2023, but he's since then doubled down and kept kind of saying this.

### 📌 まとめ

So, this isn't old news. He's still saying that this is a a great test of the AI's ability. He's calling it the modern touring test. The question is, can an AI agent can it generate $1 million in profit? So, the test is basically go make1 million on a retail web platform in a few months with just $100,000 investment.

### ✅ 結論

So, again, we've seen the AI agent village, right? They they made some profit. I believe hundreds of dollars in profit over 3 months selling t-shirts and one of the co-founders of Google at Demine is kind of saying whenever we get to a million that's the true new sort of modern touring test. So me asking these AI agents to make $10,000 in revenue. I mean in theory seems like it's not completely insane.

### 📚 追加情報

And I'm not saying it will happen. It will probably be, you know, the hilarious outcome where everything falls apart and I rude a day that I started this experiment. But, you know, as as the kids say, yolo. Back in my days, we used to say heartbe. Same thing really.

### 🔖 補足

We'll get back to that in just a second. But, a quick aside, if you've been following the AI space, you know how fragmented it is right now. Usually have to go to one site for images, yet another site for good video, yet another site for good audio. It's expensive and it kills your workflow. And that's why Hakesfield AI is one of the fastest growing genai companies right now.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Thank you to Hakesfield AI for sponsoring this segment. They've built a platform that aggregates the world's leading models like Nanobana Pro, Cling 2.6 audio, and one 2.5 all inside a single dashboard on the web. The feature that I want to show you today is called Cinema Studio. This is the first real end-to-end filmmaking pipeline that I've used. Usually AI video feels random, but Cinema Studio is designed for control.

### 🚀 セクション 14

You start with a deliberate first frame using their text to image tool. Once you have your shot, you move directly to image to video in the same workflow. What makes this cinema studio is that it respects actual film making grammar. You aren't just guessing. You're setting the mood, the lighting, the composition.

### ⚡ セクション 15

It feels a lot less like a slot machine and a lot more like the director's monitor. You also get access to specific powerhouse models. For your base images, they have a Nano Banana Pro. This engine is incredible for resolution. It's up to 4K as well as its logic.

### 🌟 セクション 16

If you ask for three cups or a sign with a specific text, it actually renders the text correctly. It's perfect for detailed title cards or complex scenes where things need to make logical sense. Then for motion, they have Cling 2.6 audio. This is huge because it's multimodal. It generates the video and the synchronized audio, the voice and the ambience all in one pass.

### 🎬 セクション 17

Basically, Hakesfield gives you a Hollywood studio in your web browser. And the best part, it is currently the cheapest AI platform to access all these top tier models in one place. If you want to start creating cinematic shots with real control over motion and consistency, you need to try this. It's a free AI video generator that scales up to the equivalent of a full Hollywood studio. Go to hexfield.ai to get started.

### 📋 セクション 18

I've linked it right at the top of the description and in the pinned comment. Go click that link, create an account, and see what you can direct. And now, let's get back to what was it we were talking about? Oh, yeah. I remember my point was as somebody that started a business online that that did very well and somebody that's been doing this for for a decade plus kind of running online businesses whether that's e-commerce or online publishing you know maybe hopefully I I've picked up a thing or two and for it it's worth I want to put some of that knowledge information out there's there's nothing to buy I'm not selling any courses this is all going to be free it's all going to be on this channel and in fact I'm already having these AI agents kind of document everything so that in the and if they they do succeed, like everything's going to be documented day by day how they kind of went about it.

### ⭐ セクション 19

But coming back to my original point, a lot of people that talk about making money with this. A lot of the ideas, I don't want to say they're bad ideas, they're just something that I I don't think it's going to work and I don't think it's the right way of approaching building a business online or making money online. I think actually right now there's an incredible kind of time and space to launch a specific type of business and actually that's exactly what I was researching with my AI agents just a few days ago. One of the things that I developed with clot code/openclaw was something I called societies of mind. It's where we take all the latest and greatest AI models from all the frontier labs.

### 📝 セクション 20

We we put them in one sort of a chat room and we give them ideas that they have to iterate upon and and think through and design plans for and it's a little bit more expensive than running one agent and you're paying you know all the labs open AAI and XAI and Google DeepMind and Anthropic etc. But what I did was I did some research about who is running the type of businesses that I think would work exceptionally well right now. And here they are. You're welcome to see it. I'm sharing my research that I've paid for that my AI agents have shed blood, sweat, and tears trying to figure out.

### 💡 セクション 21

Here it is. This is all verified so you can check for yourself. So these are solo founder money machines. So they have to be, you know, created and run by one person. So, not a huge team, not dozens of people, not hundreds of people, one lone wolf, if you will.

### 🔧 セクション 22

And they have to be money machines. They have to be just like spitting out cash. And seeing as how I'm having these large language models from these big labs doing the research, they're obviously going to be above board and legal and ethical. They're not going to pitch me any horrible ideas. So, there's a few very interesting business ideas that they kind of listed.

### 🎯 セクション 23

By the way, none of this is to copy or or or to like rip them off or copycat their businesses. That's unlikely to work. This is think of it as training data, right? We train these machines not so that they just regurgitate the thing that they learned. We want them to generalize.

### 💭 セクション 24

We want them to take the concepts that they've learned and apply them to other never-beforeseen concepts. Like if you want to compete in that ninja competition where you scale walls and climb and stuff, right? You might train on some stuff at home in your own little homemade courses, but the goal isn't to get faster on your little homemade course. The goal is to learn the skills that in general will allow you to get better at running the unseen course. That's like the finals because you don't know what it looks like.

### 📌 セクション 25

You don't know exactly how to prepare for it, but you work on the stuff to get better at that stuff in general. So try to understand in general what these founders are doing, right? so that you can come up with other ideas that are not on this page that would allow you to create a similar business. So, just a couple examples. One is a photo.

### ✅ セクション 26

Photo PE is an absolutely insane business. So, it's photop.com. It's a free online photo editor. Here's the thing, they don't come out and outright say it, but here's the thing. It's a Photoshop clone.

### 📚 セクション 27

If you've used Photoshop, if you know Photoshop using this, there will be no sort of transition, no downtime. You're going to pick it up like that. The reason you're going to pick it up just like that is because it's I don't want to say it's the same. I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but let's say it's really similar and it runs in your browser and it has, you know, some ads that are kind of running here on the side. So, as you're working on the left side, there's some ads that are running on the right side.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And they also have a premium version, $5 a month, no ads. You get a bunch of credits, some features. And PhotoP was developed by one person. It's being run by one person and it's making 200,000 per month. So millions per year.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Now that one is well known and that one's seen by everyone as a big success that the people that kind of know about it. So maybe there's not like a a million of those types of businesses, but there's a lot at slightly lower income. Let's say slightly lower revenue. PDF.ai AI is making 41,000 a month. I remember when this came out because this was shortly after chat GPT and the idea is simple.

### 🚀 セクション 30

You upload your PDF and you can chat to it. So it's one of the earlier kind of versions of this as soon as these large language models started getting better of chatbt and the others. This person put up a website PDF.ai and it allowed people this revolutionary ability to upload a PDF and ask it questions. Now you might be wondering but wait a minute isn't that just like a basic function in Chad GPT and Gemini and Claude and Xide that doesn't every single LM can do this and the answer is yes they can. This comes as standard for every LLM and all this is doing is taking just that one function and just that's all it does.

### ⚡ セクション 31

The same person also made a testimonial. So that's making 66,000 per month. You might have heard about Peter Levelvels, right? So, he made multiple things with AI as well. Photoai.com is making 110,000 per month.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Interior AAI is making 38,000 month. Remote 37. He's got a bunch of stuff that's making money. He's also the guy behind the excellent Fly Peter game, right? Which is basically a flying simulator.

### 🎬 セクション 33

It's very wellmade. You can fly around. It's blowing up my speakers, so I'm sorry if I'm talking weird. Okay, there's no way I can do that because it's like in my ear and I wasn't sure how to turn it off, but basically it's a flying sim. The neat thing about it was that it was mostly vibecoded.

### 📋 セクション 34

So, an AI built to most of this game and I think at the peak they were making like 80,000 a month by selling ad space. You can see here promote your startup with its own in-game ad reach 100,000 plus people. So, those are businesses that would be somewhat simple to replicate. Again, don't replicate them. That's not the point of this.

### ⭐ セクション 35

learn from what they're doing, from their principles, and build your own new thing because they weren't replicating, they were innovating. So that's kind of part of the thing that you got to do. You're not chasing the crowd. You're kind of blue ocean it. So that's one type or class of business.

### 📝 セクション 36

There's another even sort of better type of business. It's something that could be replicated if you know how to code, if you're a developer. But the cool thing about it is over time it kind of grows its own moat. meaning that like right now if you wanted to go and compete with it after it's been around for a few years you can't or it would be extremely difficult. Built with is one such business.

### 💡 セクション 37

The idea is pretty simple. Basically you go in there and you type in any website and this thing tells you what the tech stack is. What was it built with? Was it built with WordPress or Shopify? Does it run Mailchimp?

### 🔧 セクション 38

And I've used it a number of times just because I was interested like oh how did this person build this? Did they use a Shopify? what do they use? But here's the thing. Over time, he started collecting this data and now has a massive database of stores and websites and what they run on.

### 🎯 セクション 39

And so now hedge funds pay him a lot of money to have access to this real-time data, right? Because imagine one month Shopify doubles the amount of websites that it's operating. Shopify is an e-commerce platform, by the way. That's what I used in part to grow my e-commerce business back in the days. But the point is, it started with something simple.

### 💭 セクション 40

over time built its own moat, gathered data, and now it's got thousands of customers, including hedge funds, that pay for access to that data. And even if you cloned the functionality, you still can't clone the data. You still need to do this for a long long time to build up that database. And they're making between 300,000 per month to just under 1 million per month. How many employees work for this company?

### 📌 セクション 41

One, Gary Brewer, right? And so it's doing about 14 million a year. So when I started my e-commerce store back in later part of 2016, it was an e-commerce business selling a physical product that I had to ship to my customers since I was the only person running it and building it and and doing most stuff. As you can imagine, that is not a lot of stuff that I could do myself in a 24-hour window. So, in the beginning, in the first few months, I was uh taping up the packets of, you know, the products to fulfill customers orders and going to the local post office and sending it.

### ✅ セクション 42

I'm pretty sure I have some pictures lying around somewhere. I'll I'll show you those. I'll show you those in another video, but I relied on various other sort of thirdparty providers for a lot of the business. I had a 3PL. 3PL, I think, stands for thirdparty logistics.

### 📚 セクション 43

So, it's somebody else that fulfills your order. So, it's basically a warehouse. You send all the product to that warehouse and they they handle everything and you just pay them per package sent plus some percent or some fee. And if you have a e-commerce system like Shopify, it just gets automated, right? So, they send the information there, they ship it, you're done.

### 🔖 セクション 44

And so, a lot of this was just basically trying to automate or outsource whatever software I needed. I just purchased a product. It was kind of a Frankenstein business because I had so many different software kind of like hacked onto it. But, it worked well. Again, it did a million in its first year in sales and it was profitable.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It wasn't hugely profitable cuz the expenses were especially for a physical product business there. There's a lot of costs that go into it. But if you've seen my videos, you know that I'm not some sort of a mastermind genius. My superpower is just my ADHD. I just tend to really focus and get obsessed with things that interest me.

### 🚀 セクション 46

And this held my attention for a while. Again, that's a story for another day. Basically, in a nutshell, what happened was one month I made more money in that month than ever before in my life I've made in a year. And you'd assume that I would be just ecstatic grinning from ear to ear. And I was not.

### ⚡ セクション 47

I was miserable. Again, I'll dive into all of that in an upcoming video. But coming back to the original point of this video, after having my AI agents do massive, massive amounts of research, cataloging tons of businesses that I thought were perfect businesses to to learn from, again, not replicate, but use them as case studies to kind of figure out what I would do. And specifically, it was solo founders, you know, one one one person operations, Lonewolf, things that were digital in nature. I did not want to start a a physical e-commerce business again.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Some people might love it. I I just didn't want to do it again unless it was something that that I was really excited about at least. And here's the thing. Once I had the collection of those databases, I mean, the whole point of it was asking these chat bots, can you replicate it? Because they're getting extremely good at coding and building stuff, as you'll see in just a second.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So, the question was, can you replicate it? or not replicated, but can you build something similar that's unique and innovative and different? The point is like the type of business I was looking for was something that I wanted the AI agents to be able to build. And so after doing all that research and them having all that context cuz as they were doing the research, they they also they see what what's working. They're also kind of recognizing patterns.

### 📋 セクション 50

I said, "Okay, give me 10 to 20 ideas about what this perfect business idea would be." and they did and they gave me 10 ideas and nine of them were really good, really solid ideas. One of the reasons I was doing this is I was actually going to do a video and kind of give those ideas out so people who are interested in something like this could go and take them and run with them. And I'll still do that. But there was one idea on there that I was like, hm, that's interesting. And then my brain wouldn't allow me to to leave it.

### ⭐ セクション 51

It kept coming back and going, wait a minute, this is good. It's simple. It's really useful. It's me kind of eating my own dog food, if you will, and meaning that it's something that I need and I know exactly what the product needs to be for me to meet my need. I know the value is high.

### 📝 セクション 52

The cost to provide that value in the form of that product is super low. It's cheap to to create. I can probably run it for absolutely for free for hundreds or even thousands of users. And so to me, my brain with its ADHD wants to chase those shiny objects. And it's been a problem most of my life because wins come from doubling down on something.

### 💡 セクション 53

And when I tend to lose and screw up is when I start chasing things. Like if something's working over here, I'm like, "Oh, there's all these other shiny objects that I need to chase." That's when things go bad for me. But the idea was really good. So, I decided to ask this society of mines, these agents, like, "Hey, c, can you build this in just in its entirety? Can you get it to $10,000 per month revenue, like, I want to do the the bare minimum possible?" They deliberated for a while because again, there's five of them chatting back and forth and doing all sorts of stuff.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Notice they did a product road map, technical architecture, diagram, financial model, marketing playbook. They figured out what they would need for the front end, the back end, the databases, Stripe payments, which by the way, what I've been showing you my revenue in. That's Stripe. That's the dashboard where you take those payments. And really, what they would need for me is nothing that would take a lot of time.

### 🎯 セクション 55

It's things like hooking up Stripe cuz they need you need a human to do that. Although, I don't even know if that's necessarily true. Stripe has a great API, but they would need some sort of final approval. They would need me to set up, you know, the banking stuff, whatever. So, here's what I'm thinking.

### 💭 セクション 56

I'm going to launch the business and have these AI agents run it. Again, 95% autonomously. I'll sit down in the meetings. I'll approve some things, maybe make some suggestions, vote on what they should do, but I'm not going to do any actual work. I'm not going to write any copy.

### 📌 セクション 57

I'm not going to write any code. I'm not going to run any marketing campaigns other than I mean if I'm talking about on this channel I guess that's I mean in a very real sense that is a a marketing campaign but I want to see how they do it two I'll share everything on this channel the income the good the bad the ugly just everything it'll be there for your edification and entertainment I'm going to teach how to do AI agents right so a lot of the people are very interested in this of course cloudbot openclaw multbot whatever you want to call it, it's a big big deal. Now, there's a lot of people, creators, people on X, etc. saying that these things can't do anything and it's all a scam and it's all bad and it's all this and that. If you've been watching this channel, you know they've been saying that for a while about all the things that we now know AI can do.

### ✅ セクション 58

6 to 12 months ago, everybody was saying how there's no way that AI is going to get good at coding. In the last two months, we've seen engineers at Google say that they're relying on, for example, cloud code, interestingly, to code up some of the stuff they need. The actual the actual inventor, the developer of cloud code is saying that at this point, most of the stuff, most of the code and contributions that he's doing for cloud code, they're written by cloud code. So, this thing is in a very real way is doing a recursive self-improvement. It's improving itself.

### 📚 セクション 59

I have a video that I recorded late last night, yesterday. I think it's actually part two of the last video that I uploaded. The last part of it was me just walking you through everything that I've built with Cloudbot. Most of the stuff that I built were just functionalities for Cloudbot itself. I taught it how to use the phone.

### 🔖 セクション 60

I taught it how to transcribe my voice messages and then reply back with 11 Labs. How to hook itself up to Twilio so it can text, so it can make phone calls. I taught it how to search the web using, for example, Brave API. I taught it how to make videos, how to edit videos. Editing videos is the only task.

### 🎨 セクション 61

It didn't fail. It It did it, but it that's one area where I'm like, "Okay, you're not going to be editing videos anytime soon." Everything else, it did extremely well. So that's the very next video that's going to come out right after this one within the next 12 to 24 hours that will show you the first 48 hours of me from the time that I got my hands on Claudebot and just building out all the functionalities that I needed to get it to the point where you know it's doing this sort of deep deep research putting it together creating a report and then actually coming up with kind of stunningly good ideas about how to take advantage of it. I've already had them build websites, deploy apps on those websites. And as you'll see in my very next video, I've taught it how to replicate itself.

### 🚀 セクション 62

So basically all the skills that it learns, it creates a virtual private server, connects to that server, replicates itself, makes sure that that new instance of the AI agent has all the skills that it learned before, and then just make sure it runs, make sure it runs 24/7, make sure that the server is secure. Today I was out and about and I'm constantly texting my main agent through telegram so that it keeps doing stuff and at some point I copied and pasted some stuff that it's par something happened. It crashed it. It the whole thing went down and it wouldn't respond. And since I wasn't home I didn't have access to my computer.

### ⚡ セクション 63

I started feeling kind of naked without it. I was like this is this doesn't feel good. I can't text my agent. It's not doing anything. At some point I realized I can actually gauge one of the other agents that I built to see if that thing could fix its what brother, sister, sibling, whatever you want to call it, it's twin, which it did.

### 🌟 セクション 64

It said, "Oh, this agent something happened to the context window. Whatever you posted, something happened. It impacted the context window. Let me reset it." It reset it and the thing started working again. Now, I know to some of you this might sound like science fiction.

### 🎬 セクション 65

It might sound like just nonsense. There's no way that this is happening. As you're going to see over the next days and weeks, all this is very, very real. The reason that I wanted to post this video first is to give everybody kind of an idea of where I'm thinking of heading with this. So, first and foremost, make sure you're subscribed because after this video, a lot of this stuff is going to be time-sensitive.

### 📋 セクション 66

It's going to be actionable and it's going to be made to teach you how to do this stuff. For the last five, six days, I was just head down building stuff and learning how to use this thing. I'm finally ready to like start posting this stuff online. I apologize that I am sort of running a little bit behind because literally here's the video. It's almost done.

### ⭐ セクション 67

It goes over everything I've built, you know, up to about 2 days ago. I'm going to publish that ASAP. And right after that, I'll have a tutorial about how to install this thing whether it's in the cloud on on a VPN or on a Mac Mini. Me personally, I got this thing. They are very cheap.

### 📝 セクション 68

I think this was like 140. It's a mini computer. It's got all your ports and USB ports and Ethernet and all that stuff. It uses minimal electricity and it can run multiple agents 24/7 from the comfort of your own home on this local device. This is what future employees look like.

### 💡 セクション 69

This is where everything is going. This is what's going to be operating your business, you know, within the next few months hopefully. I probably should be a little bit careful about when I say that because it the truth is we're still very very early. These things are a security nightmare. They're still kind of this combination of genius and kind of dumb.

### 🔧 セクション 70

Google Deep Mind recently had all the AI models compete in various tournaments. I think they had chess, Texas Holde, Werewolf, and I was curious to see how well Cloudbot would be able to kind of create a website that would allow for a lot of these agents to compete in games, climb rankings, etc. I asked it to build everything out, put on HTML, create the needed APIs, databases, etc. It did. It took six minutes, right?

This is absolutely genius. This is a highly skilled software developer doing days of work in 6 minutes, right? And then it says, "Oh, here's how you run it locally, knowing full well that it's on a virtual private server on its own computer, not on my computer. me running that would do nothing because I'm not on its computer and that's kind of what I mean because it's an absolute genius that works at lightning speed and then kind of a derp but when I mentioned it it realized its error and it actually created a free link somehow I guess through a cloudflare server I guess there's a free way to kind of demo or preview links so it just gave me a link on something something.cloudflare.com cloudflare.com. They just allowed me to kind of check that website out.

I might launch that pretty soon here as well. So, couple things. Number one, type below what you think of this. Are you interested? Cuz again, for me, doing this is like one of those shiny objects that I tend to chase.

It's going to give me lots of dopamine hits. I'm sure it's going to be very exciting. But right now, my my main business, my main focus should be this channel. This is what I do full-time.

I I'm still getting through all the comments you left on the previous video telling me about kind of what you're interested in. So, bear with me. Those were extremely extremely helpful and thank you. So, if people have an interest in this, I'm more than happy to provide it all for free. No payw walls, no nothing held back.

Again, this isn't leading up to some course. But if people are not interested, this isn't just your cup of tea. If there's not enough people interested in this sort of content, that's totally fine, too. I'm really like itching to have these AI agents attempt to create a business. If this is like a world first that that they accomplish, uh that would be kind of nuts.

### 🔖 セクション 76

But if there's not enough interest, then I should be a responsible adult and just focus on what I need to be doing. With that said, these are incredibly exciting times. Also, understand that these could be incredibly dangerous times if you choose to run these agents because there's nothing about them that's polished. This isn't the iPhone that had however many generations of polish and improvements. This is not a walled garden.

This is uh hardcore mode. If you've ever played the video games, right, hardcore mode is like if if you die, game over, character lost. So, this is kind of that high risk, high reward situation if you're going to attempt to run it. Security is going to be important. We don't even know what kind of regulations are going to be applied here in the future as well.

### 🚀 セクション 78

But with that said, and mark my words, I think this year we're going to be seeing a lot of people have extraordinary success on sort of the backs of these AI agents. I can't see how it won't have a massive impact. So, with that said, thank you so much for watching. Comment, let me know what I can help you with. If you've commented on the previous video, thank you so much.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Still going through every single comment. Hopefully, I'll get through all of them. Make sure you subscribe because we're definitely going to start posting a lot more information about this specific topic, including tutorials. And uh yeah, buckle up. We've just entered the intelligence era.

Stay safe. My mantra going forward is going to be let the robots do the work. I repeat that to myself every morning that I wake up. Let the robots do the work. Thank you for watching.
