## 💡 概要

スタンフォード大学のJun Park研究者が開発した「Simile」は、数年前の「Smallville」実験を大規模に進化させたAI社会シミュレーションプラットフォームです。1億ドルのシード資金を調達し、Andre Karpathy（OpenAI共同創業者）、Fei-Fei Li（AIの母）らが支援。CVS HealthやTelstraなど大企業が既に利用を開始しています。市場調査、製品テスト、決算発表の質問予測（85%の精度）など、ビッグデータから「ビッグシミュレーション」への移行を示唆しています。企業の意思決定者、AI研究者、社会科学者向けに、シミュレーション技術の革新的な可能性を解説した内容です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **1億ドルのシード資金**: Andre Karpathy（OpenAI共同創業者）、Fei-Fei Li（スタンフォードHAI共同ディレクター）、Adam D'Angelo（Quora CEO、OpenAI取締役）らが出資
- **ビッグデータからビッグシミュレーションへ**: 従来の実データ収集・分析から、仮想シミュレーションでデータ生成する時代への転換。10,000人へのインタビューではなく、100,000人のシミュレーションで洞察を得る
- **決算発表の質問を85%予測**: アナリストが尋ねる質問の10問中8問を正確に予測。企業は事前にシミュレーションで準備可能になる
- **イノベーション税の削減**: スタートアップが1,000回のシミュレーションを実世界1回分のコストで実行可能。999回失敗しても1回の成功パターンを見つけられる
- **平均値を超えた分析**: 従来の統計は平均を求めるが、Simileは1%の強烈な反応や予期せぬトレンドなど、現実世界の特異性を捉えられる可能性がある

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

A few years ago, there was this experiment out of Stanford to see what happens if you populate a village with large language models. Can you simulate what happens? Can it sort of simulate what happens in the real world? It was by Jun Park, Smallville, aka interactive similacra. Absolutely loved covering that story.

### 📋 背景・概要

Highly, highly fascinating paper and now it's back and bigger than ever. So, Jun Park, the the Stanford researcher, so he's back with something that he's calling simile. And the basic concept is to take this idea of digital twins and create entire societies. So let's say you take entire demographics based on transcripts, transaction logs, scientific data, whatever. So you create societies, cities, villages, whatever.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Then you run the simulation. And the goal here is to be able to ask certain specific questions about what happens. What happens if we raise or lower taxes? What happens if there's a new marketing campaign for a specific product? How do people react to this news breaking out?

### 📝 詳細説明

Really anything you want, but specifically targeting kind of like the social interactions. How do certain news flow through the community? How do people respond? And this isn't like a little project. This thing is massive and has some pretty big heavyweights on board.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So there's a few angel investors including Andre Karpathy. So he's the co-founder of OpenAI. He was a former director of AI at Tesla, a big name in the industry. You have Faith Lee who is the the godmother of AI. She's the co-director of Stanford's human centered AI institute.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

We also have Adam D'Angelo. So you might remember him from that whole OpenAI fiasco where Sam Alman got fired. He was one of the board members. He's still on the board of OpenAI. He's the CEO of Quora.

### 🎯 応用例

Then we have GMO Raj who's the CEO of Versell. Huge company widely used. Recently I was using my AI agents OpenCloud to build something with it. I suggested they use WordPress. They were like, "No, dude.

### 💭 考察

We're not using WordPress. We're using Versell." Is it Versel? I don't even know how to pronounce it, but they told me that's the way to go. And I went along with it. Very happy.

### 📌 まとめ

You know, five out of five stars would let my AI agents use it again. And it's called Bilski, Adobe's chief strategy officer and founder of Behance. Okay, but what's the big deal here? So, the original Similac paper was kind of mind-blowing because it was very very early in sort of like the the chat GPT story. I think they were using chat GPT or GBT 3.5 Turbo at the time to simulate all the agents in the village.

### ✅ 結論

I believe there were 25 agents or you know little characters and they had those cutesy pixel art animations and each of them had a backstory personality. They had jobs or they went to school. They were married to people. They had kids etc. And they had a little schedule too.

### 📚 追加情報

So they kind of woke up oh 8 a.m. I got to go to work or I got to go to school etc. So they literally lived out their entire lives, did their chores, interact with their loved ones, etc. And at the time the question was very simple. What happens if we give one of them kind of a inspirational idea?

### 🔖 補足

So imagine like almost like it's some sort of a divine inspiration where God shows up in your sleep and says do this and you're like ah I got to go do this. So they did that to one of the characters. I think Isabella was her name. This was years ago. So, I apologize if I miss some details, but they told her, "You shall create a a Valentine's Day party for everyone in the city." Interestingly, I just realized that they're launching it a day before Valentine's Day.

### 🎨 セクション 13

And in the past, that whole thing was about organizing a Valentine's Day party. But the point was to see how well this community would sort of be able to create this party because again, they only notified one person. So this one person had to first and foremost tell everybody else, convince them to have it. Then they had to plan the party, they had to organize the party, etc., etc., etc. So on day one or day zero, whatever you want to call it, it's only Isabella knew that that she had this idea.

### 🚀 セクション 14

No one else was thinking about it. So she went, she talked to her closest friends and she told her, "Hey, let's do this party." And some of them liked it and some of them didn't. But the news kind of percolated throughout their little village, their their little society. To fast forward to the end of it, like they did have the Valentine party. Not every single person who came was invited by Sabella, the original person.

### ⚡ セクション 15

So some of it kind of percolated. So she would tell person A, person A would tell person B, and then person B would would show up. So there was this kind of like ways of information traveling through people similar to how it does in the real life in the real world. And some people wanted to show up, some people forgot to show up, some people did not want to show up and didn't show up. So it very much simulated how, at least in that sort of small village, small society, how things could have went.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And one highly, highly interesting thing about this paper, looking back at it now, is they figured out a lot of ways and a lot of scaffolding to create around these large language models that were highly highly effective. They had, for example, a memory stream. and they would organize their memories in terms of how relevant they were in terms of like the recency etc. So over time instead of just forgetting everything they kind of had their most core memories and that that kind of memory pool was added to over time so they just didn't forget everything all of a sudden. The interesting thing about that is now with AI agents like OpenClaw I mean we're seeing a lot of the same ideas being incorporated to make these agents highly highly highly capable.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So I think a lot of us expected more to come out of this. We knew there was going to be more and more projects, bigger projects coming out of this because the whole idea seemed number one useful for predicting human behavior for simulating it and just I think it captured a lot of people's imaginations and we didn't hear anything for quite some time and finally today I think they're coming out of stealth mode and talking about it and apparently they already had a $100 million seed round. So this thing has some serious people behind it. It's got some serious money behind it and apparently it already has some large enterprise clients that are behind it that are on board. CVS Health, a pharmacy store here in the United States as well as Telra.

### 📋 セクション 18

They provide mobile coverage, mobile phones, internet, etc. And so some of the things that these companies might want to do is for example have market research done to see how a group of let's say a thousand people might react to a brand new marketing campaign or product testing UI testing etc. Jun Park reported that this has been pretty accurate in terms of predicting the analyst questions during simulated earning calls. So the models correctly predict eight out of 10 of these earning calls that are asked by analysts. So, if you think about it, that could be extremely extremely useful.

### ⭐ セクション 19

You're doing an earning call. It's live. People are not going to be asking you tough questions, but you can run the simulation and it tells you like, here's most likely what they're going to ask. So, you can prepare for it. This can also be used for social science.

### 📝 セクション 20

How will people respond to new health scares or economic shocks, for example. I think they should rerun 2020 and and see like is the whole toilet paper being gone everywhere. Was that predictable? Like, was it was it obvious? because I was aware of that whole thing happening very very early on but somehow the whole toilet paper thing was was never on my bingo card.

### 💡 セクション 21

So why is this such a big deal? Now if you think about it this kind of might mark a transition from big data to big simulation meaning that in the past companies the more data they had that was kind of like the gold that was the the oil digital oil because you can mine that data to prepare for certain events to forecast etc. So having that data stored somewhere and then kind of parsing through it and trying to extract insights was a big big deal. If these simulations get large enough and accurate enough that might not be as important like that that realworld data stored somewhere might not be as important. Instead it's going to transition to running these simulations to try to extract data like that virtual simulation data from there.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So instead of going out there and interviewing 10,000 customers to try to see what they think and then you know like getting that data, you run a simulation with 100,000 customers and you kind of figure out what they think based on that simulation or how they would react to a new brand new marketing campaign. The other big shift here might be the fact that you know a lot of startups there's this thing that's referred to sometimes as the innovation tax, right? You might have heard of it as the pioneers have arrows in their backs. Basically the whole idea that when you're the first to market with something, when you have some innovative idea, there's a cost to it because if you fail, you pay the price because a failure is expensive. But yet, if you figure something out, then other people can come in and sort of copy what you're doing, etc.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So, the first movers, you know, there's a first mover advantage, but there's also an innovation tax, and the two kind of balance each other off. But imagine if there wasn't an innovation tax. What if a startup or a brand new company, what if it could run a thousand simulations about how something will unfold, a new product or anything like that and it can run it in those digital simulation sandboxes, right? Gather the data, see, okay, it seems like this is the wing approach. This is kind of like the more dangerous approaches, etc.

### 💭 セクション 24

So, what if the cost of running those thousand simulations are equivalent to the expense of actually executing one of those in the real world? That means you can try a thousand times for that same price. That really cuts down on that innovation tax. You can fail 999 times in that simulation as long as you find that that one sort of winning outcome. Now, of course, a lot of this is going to be a little bit more statistics based, right?

### 📌 セクション 25

So maybe the simulation is going to be accurate only 85% of the time or whatever. I say 85% because in that statement by Jun Sun Park, the the researcher behind this, that's what they found in relation to those uh earnings calls, right? it was 85% of the time it was accurate. And again, it's only going to keep getting better and better. But let's assume it's just 85%.

### ✅ セクション 26

If you can run simulations that are 85% accurate, even that would be incredibly beneficial. But here's kind of what I think is the big thing, the big deal that might have a outsiz effect. A lot of our data statistics, they they kind of they regress to the mean. They're kind of trying to find the average person. What does the average person think about this phone, right?

### 📚 セクション 27

How do they rate it? They rate it 8 out of 10 or whatever. But the reality is across that average, there's a lot of different people for a lot of different opinions. Some of them have an outsized effect on the market. And just looking at the average doesn't really necessarily predict how people will behave.

### 🔖 セクション 28

What if 99% of the people are okay with something and then 1% of the people that get really triggered by a particular message that you're putting out there or some feature that your product has, they go, you know, declare a war and make lots of noise about it. The rest of the people that are, you know, they're okay. They're look warm with the product. They like it, but they don't love it, but they don't hate it. But they do see this one group of people that are damaged by the product or triggered.

### 🎨 セクション 29

What whatever happens, right? we're may be able to simulate those weird idiosyncratic things that that kind of happen out there in the real world cuz again, you know, if you're looking at averages, on average everybody's fine, right? Everybody sort of likes it. No problems. But that minority of people might have an outsized effect.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And this would allow us to capture those weird trends and and weird eentricities that might happen that that we can see in a simulation that we can't if we're running some statistical analysis on a bunch of data. And of course, this could be huge for stock market analysis. You might simulate CEOs and market traders and a lot of people involved like leadership teams and companies to see how they react to a market crash or a competitor's moves and see if you can predict some things before they occur. Certainly, there were conversations in my life that I'd love to be able to run through something like this to to hopefully get a glimpse into how they how might they go. like if we have to give this person some tough news, what are some possible sort of outcomes of this happening?

### ⚡ セクション 31

What might they say? How may I react? And would that trigger anything? Anyways, very excited to see more coming out of this company. Similey and June, of course, I'm so happy that he's having success.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Obviously, incredibly intelligent person, one of the first really mind-blowing papers utilizing Chad GPT. Absolutely loved everything that he did there and expecting to see a lot more from this. They're on Twitter x simile company at simile_ai. So I think this company is going to answer a lot of questions that people have and it might even raise a new question so to speak and that is if running simulations to get data if it's so incredible and I'm sure the data is more valuable the more accurate a simulation is then what's the chance that this is a simulation and we're all just here stuck reacting to some marketing campaign. Something to think about.
