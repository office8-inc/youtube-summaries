## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

So today uh I thought we could try something a bit more different than what we have been doing lately. But we are going to stay on my Mac mini AI agent where we have been using cloud code to execute autonomous things like yeah by leveraging skills MD or skill MD I guess. So if you haven't seen any of the videos and you quite don't understand what I'm talking about I have explained kind of the setup before if you want to check that out. So today I wanted to see if we can do more of like a normal task than we have been doing lately. So I wanted to see if we can kind of use the browserbased automation system.

### 📋 背景・概要

This means no API to actually execute some more of like accounting tasks. So we're going to use it to try to set it up or train it up to fetch PDF invoices from our Gmail. We're going to take that invoice over to our accounting software and we're going to add this invoice to our system, create a new invoice, send it to a customer via email or something like that. Basically, just going to test it out and see how well well it can perform on this more yeah, I guess already existing tasks that people are actually doing for work now. So, I think we're just going to head over to the agent or the Mac Mini and I'm going to show you how I want to set this up.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Okay. So, here is how I'm going to do this. So, you can see I am in my cloud code in kind of my AI uh agent setup here. So, if you go to skills, you can see we have a big list of skills we have already trained on. You can see we have our X skill, we have our React video skill, coding skills, expost.

### 📝 詳細説明

Yeah, a bunch of different skills. And we have an accounting. I just set it up for testing. Okay, so this is the skill we're going to try to use today to actually do some work. And you can see we also have our Gmail skill that we can use to navigate Gmail.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So if we head to our uh Chrome browser now, you can see this is the software I found. It's just a test account on something called accounting.com. And this is a very simple accounting software. You can try for free. So I just set it up and just to see if we can use this.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And I also did create some mock data invoices. I sent them to myself. So you can see we have three or I sent them to the agent's Gmail. So we have three different invoices here. Now I guess I forgot to add the invoice here.

### 🎯 応用例

I'm going to fix that. So you can see we have the invoices uh attached. And this is we're going to see if the agent is able to actually read those emails, get the information from the invoices and bring it over to the other software to put it into our accounting setup. So I'm just going to resend this email here and uh just to get the attachment. Okay.

### 💭 考察

So here we have it. So now we have all the attachments. So before we do that, I just want to show you what I already have done because I said I did test it out using uh just testing the accounting skill. So now I'm going to show you where we are at with the agent. So, I'm just going to close this and I'm going to do a prompt here just to see to show you how that it already can operate kind of the software here.

### 📌 まとめ

So, I'm just going to say I'm just going to give it some kind of instruction here. So, we need to create a draft invoice for the customer all about AI $1,000 job for a sponsorship. Use the accountant skill. So, that is what I tested before I recorded this video. So, hopefully now it should be very effective while using this skill.

### ✅ 結論

going over to the accountant software, uh, creating the invoice, filling out all the details we kind of gave it here. Okay. So, you can see it already knows some of this. It looks at the skill. It needs to do a CDP script and $1,000 is,000 uh 1000,000 in cents.

### 📚 追加情報

Okay. So, let's see how it's going to navigate this now. So, it created some kind of script it's going to use over here now. So, now you can see we go straight to new invoice. So, we click on sales invoices.

### 🔖 補足

Okay. So, you can see now it's going into customer. I guess we already have a customer since I tested this earlier, but basically it's just going to select I guess it's going to be all about AI. Yeah, we get that up. And this is the setup.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, build to all about AI. Now, it probably next it needs to do is add a new item. You can see it's running in the background here. Yeah, it clicked on add a new item and the amount is $1,000. But basically now it just has to select those.

### 🚀 セクション 14

We got two though. So it probably needs to delete one of them. Let's see if we can do that. So it's going to do a screenshot. Okay, that's good.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Yeah, I need to delete one. Okay, so that was done. Perfect. And the next part is basically I think all we have to do now is just save this and we should have our invoice right now. Let's scroll down and save it.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Yeah, perfect. And something I haven't tried yet. And when we have saved this now, perfect. This is a draft. So now I want to try to send this to my email.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So I haven't tried it. So let's see if we can just figure this out uh straight away. So let me just uh give it some instructions here. You can see it should be ready. We have the invoice here.

### 📋 セクション 18

Uh let's see if we can just send this uh or just wait a bit. Maybe we need to download this and send it via Gmail instead. Let's try that. So what if we just try Okay, great. Uh I need to send this to uh another Gmail address.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Attach the invoice. Use the Gmail skill for this. Uh add a fitting text uh subject line something like this. Uh, okay. So, let's just see if it can do this.

### 📝 セクション 20

I haven't tried this before. So, it should know how to use Gmail at least partially. I haven't tested it too much, but now I want to see. It needs to some way to grab the invoice here. I'm not sure if it knows how to do this.

### 💡 セクション 21

I guess it could download the invoice. He found the download link. Okay, that's good. And yeah, we downloaded this into our temporary file system. Perfect.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Okay. So, now we are going into Gmail. Perfect. You can see we have our three uh emails from before. So, it probably needs to click on compose now.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Yeah, it's clicking on compose. Okay. So, we got two two compose up here. So, maybe that was a bit much. Uh we need to use the attachment, right?

### 💭 セクション 24

And I think it should know how to send emails. But let's see if we can actually do the attachment here. Okay, so we found the email address. That's pretty good. So, that was pretty fast.

### 📌 セクション 25

And it needs to do a subject line. So, it's basically just going to do something, I guess. So, it's going to do invoice one month 01 sponsorship. Okay, that's pretty good. And it needs to come up with some body tags.

### ✅ セクション 26

Please find the attached invoice. Best EJ $1,000. And now, let's see if we can do the attachment. That is going to be the PDF. Yeah, no problem.

### 📚 セクション 27

Okay. So you can see how effective this is. Uh now I guess I just have to send this and that should be done. Okay, so now it's kind of prompting me. I'm not running in dangerously skip now.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So I'm just going to say yes. Or I guess I was. But yeah, that's fine. So we're going to send that. We sent it.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So that was surprisingly easy, right? And you can see it's pretty fast. It's not really slow though. So that should be done. And for that I think we're just going to update our skill.

### 🚀 セクション 30

So I'm just going to come up with a prompt here. I'm just going to prompt it. uh update the accounting skill with the workflow you use to create this and send invoice via Gmail so we save time the next time we're going to do this. Okay, so now that was pretty much it. So, uh I'm going to check the email and I'm going to check the invoice just to see how it looks.

### ⚡ セクション 31

So, let's let me head over to my different Gmail account here. And yeah, here we have it. So, you can see here's the cloth email. So, if I click in today, hi there. Hope you're doing well.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Please find the attached uh this one. Uh let's open it up. Yeah, you can see video sponsorship $1,000 bill to all About AI and we got it. So, yeah, that worked very well. I would say that was a very good job.

### 🎬 セクション 33

Well done, uh the AI agent. So, that was pretty smooth. So, I'm just going to leave this email now and I'm going to leave that. And now we have kind of the second thing I want to do. And it looks like our uh yeah, our skill is updated now.

### 📋 セクション 34

So you know how to handle these uh PDF files, GML, compose, attach. Next time we need to do that. But now we want to do a different skill. Okay. So uh I'm just going to clear this.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So now we want to see if we can actually grab all of those PDFs and actually put them into the accounting software. I'll try to keep it pretty simple. So okay, we have a new task. We need to check our email. if we have any invoices that needs to be logged as bills in our accounting software.

### 📝 セクション 36

If we do uh execute this uh use the Gmail skill and the accounting skill. So basically we're going to combine two skills, the Gmail skill and the accounting skill to try to execute this task. So we're going to start by checking our Gmail for invoices. Okay, we already know that right? But I cleared a memory here so we shouldn't have any idea that.

### 💡 セクション 37

Okay, so now yeah we can see we are going over to the Gmail. Okay. So, you can see clearly we have the three invoices here. So, I just want to see how it's going to solve this. Is it going to download each invoice or are we going to just read one and one email here?

### 🔧 セクション 38

I'm quite interested to see how it's going to solve this. We did the screenshot. So, it's reading the first email. This is the one from AI agent Julie about Claude code. So, I want to see if it's just going to read the invoice or if it's going to download it.

### 🎯 セクション 39

I'm not quite sure. Okay, so it's just going to click on the invoice. You can see 10 CL code accounts, $500. And yeah, this is from AI agent Julie. This is one of the first invoices we sent.

### 💭 セクション 40

Okay, but we should have two more. remember it should be time to head over to the accounting software to start putting this up as expenses I guess or bills I don't know how you say it in English okay so it's loading the accounting skill that's pretty good that's what I wanted to see and we are going over to a new bill okay so I haven't actually done this before so I'm not quite sure how it's going to do this so it needs to add a vendor. Oh, now it's going to click on new vendor and it needs to create a new vendor. Okay, so this looks probable. It has to put in a name.

### 📌 セクション 41

Let's see what it's going to do here. Yeah, it's going to put in AI agent Julie. You can see it down here. Set the name to AI agent Julie. We even got the space in between here.

### ✅ セクション 42

Okay. And probably just needs to save that. Yes, this is looking good. Okay, so we have the due date, we have the order, and we have the price for the items. So we set the order number to 100.

### 📚 セクション 43

I don't know why. So there's a hidden impute with the date value. Okay. For due date. So it really wants to change the due date.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Okay. So it actually did that. It changed the due date to 17th of March. Perfect. That was the one we put on the bill.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Now set the price to 500 bucks. Okay. So that looks like it got it in here now. Now we have items 10 claw code accounts. And it need to change the price to 500, I think it was.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Yeah. Yes. Perfect. 500. And that should be it.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Maybe we need some description. Let's see. Maybe there's no description. I don't know. No, it's just going to scroll down and save this.

### 🌟 セクション 48

And that's going to be our first bill, right? Yeah, that was saved. So, that is our first bill. This is a draft. Uh, and yeah.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Okay, perfect. So, we still have two more to do. So, I'm just going to speed this up for you so you can watch it like uh and let's see if we can do the two last two ones. Okay, so as you can see now, we have all those three bills here. I just marked them as received.

### 📋 セクション 50

And yeah, if we go to our or I guess we can ask our agent now use the accounting skill and go to dashboard uh dashboard just to see if the dashboard was updated and let's see if we can get some information from the dashboard. Okay, so you can see we have something here. Let's see. You can see we have open 1700. Okay.

### ⭐ セクション 51

So, you can see receivables, payables, 1,700 in total unpaid bills, cash flow. Yeah. So, you can see that was worked pretty good. And I would say, yeah, that was pretty smooth. And yeah, that was basically what I wanted to try out today.

### 📝 セクション 52

And I'm super happy how well it went. So, basically now I just got to come up with more difficult task, I guess, next time because this went maybe a bit too smooth. Like I had an idea that this would work pretty good, but uh yeah, this was really not any issues just to grind this out. So, would I trust this to handle all my invoices and to do all my accounting yet? I'm not sure, but it is doing a really good job.

### 💡 セクション 53

So, maybe I'll start sending some invoices to my email. I have this agent to go pick them up, put them into my accounting software, and I guess I could just put them in draft so I can just review them and approve them. That would at least save me some time. So, yeah, super interesting to see where this goes. So, if you want to follow along more how I'm actually using my Mac Mini AI agents for task like this and other task I've done in previous videos, I have some pretty cool stuff coming up.

### 🔧 セクション 54

So, yeah, give this video a like, subscribe, and I'll see you again very soon.
