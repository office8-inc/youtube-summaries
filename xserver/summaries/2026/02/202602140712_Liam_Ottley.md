## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

In 2007, Steve Jobs held up this little rectangle and said, "This is going to change everything." Most people looked at it and were like, "That's a cool phone." But here's what actually happened. That device didn't just become a phone. It became a platform. Kind of like how a shopping mall isn't just about the building itself. It's about all the stores that are inside it.

### 📋 背景・概要

And over the next 15 years, that platform created a $1.1 trillion economy and minted more millionaires than the California Gold Rush. Now, here's why I'm making this video. because something happened in AI literally in the last few weeks that looks structurally identical to that iPhone moment. The same patterns, the same economics, and except this time you don't need to be a programmer to get in on it. You don't need anyone else's permission and the barrier to entry has basically collapsed.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, here's a breakdown of what this opportunity is and how to capitalize on it before everyone else catches on. So, here's what most people don't understand about the iPhone. Apple made ton of money selling the phones. Yes, but an enormous amount of the iPhone Pi went to regular people who built stuff on top of the phone. See, when the iPhone first launched, it was completely locked down.

### 📝 詳細説明

No apps. Steve Jobs literally told developers, "You're not going to be allowed to build on here. Just make web apps." And everyone kind of just like awkwardly clapped at him. But Jobs didn't want other people building on his phone. He was worried about security and quality of the apps and all of that stuff messing up his product.

### 💡 実例・デモ

But his own board members had to pull him aside and basically say, "Steve, you're missing the point here. Let people build on the stick." So, in 2008, Apple released the App Store, which is kind of like opening up a marketplace inside the phone where anyone could set up shop. And things went insane. A 28-year-old guy called Steve Deer made a simple puzzle game called Trism. Nothing fancy, just little box sliding around.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And he made $250,000 in just 2 months. Why? Because suddenly millions of people could find and download his game in three taps. But fast forward to today, Apple has paid out $550 billion who have made apps on the App Store. half a trillion dollars not to Apple employees but to random people who build stuff on top of their platform.

### 🎯 応用例

So here's the framework that made this happen and this is really important, right? So the platform economy has three layers. The device, the thing you hold, in this case the iPhone, the marketplace where creators can reach users and get distribution for their creations. And thirdly, the value layer, which is the stuff people actually build on top of that platform. And so for the earnings here, the majority of the wealth doesn't go to the device maker, although Apple did take like a 30% cut.

### 💭 考察

Majority of the wealth goes to layer three, the people who build on top. It's kind of like how people who got rich during the gold rush weren't the miners. They were the people selling the picks and shovels and jeans to all the miners who were going there. Now, let me show you what's just appeared in AI that is exactly the same as this. So, a few weeks ago, a thing called Claudebot, now known as Open Claw, basically exploded.

### 📌 まとめ

It took the internet by storm. And if you haven't heard of it, OpenClaw is like a personal AI system that lives on your computer. But unlike chatbt where you go to a website and ask questions, this thing actually does stuff for you and it can be connected to a Telegram or WhatsApp so you can message it wherever you are. It can clear your inbox. It can book flights.

### ✅ 結論

It can manage your calendar. It could write code. It can control your smart home. And part of the magic is that it learns over time who you are and what you want it to do. Kind of like having a really smart intern who never forgets anything and works 24/7 for you.

### 📚 追加情報

It's like your own personal Jarvis. Finally, it got 70,000 stars on GitHub in about a month. And for reference, that has almost never happened. Even the former AI director at Twitter called it the most incredible sci-fi thing I've seen recently. But here's what really matters.

### 🔖 補足

Open Claw isn't the product. Open Claw is the platform. It's the iPhone equivalent. And just like the iPhone had the app store, OpenClaw now has something called Clawhub, which is a marketplace where people can share and sell skills. So a skill is basically a little instruction file that teaches the AI or Hordebot or OpenClaw, whatever you want to call it, how to do something new.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So, if you want to teach it to analyze contracts, you can create or find a skill for that. Want to teach it how to grab highquality YouTube transcripts for you, that can be a skill. If you want to teach it to research companies in a specific way, that can be a skill also. And the thing is, Clawhub already has over 3,000 of these skills. And it's been weeks, not years.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And now, here's the part that sounds almost too good to be true. And the whole reason that I'm making this video is because to build an iPhone app in 2008, you needed to learn a programming language, buy a Mac, pay Apple $99, go through their approval process, and design a whole interface for your app. But to build a skill today, you can literally just write instructions in the text file in plain English. That's it. Just some instructions, no code required at all for the most basic ones.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And that could be your foot in the door to building much more powerful ones where you can pay $20 per month for a subscription to any vibe coding platform you want and be able to build much more complicated and much more valuable skills that you can sell. So this is kind of like if the app store launched and instead of needing to learn programming, you could just write an app in your notes. So at this point you're probably thinking, "Okay, Liam, this sounds massive. Should I drop everything and just start building skills?" And this is where I need to be really honest with you. Look, I've been building AI businesses for the past 3 years now.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I run an agency called Morning Side AI. We work with Fortune 500s, NBA companies, and publicly traded companies. We do AI consulting and build AI systems for these businesses. And I've seen a lot of these going to be huge moments come and go over the past few years. And every single time there's a wave of people who chase the shiny new thing and a much smaller group who actually is able to make money with it.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, I want to give you guys a reality check here, just pure honesty from myself as a an AI business owner, what I'd recommend to you guys, and exactly what I'm recommending to all my communities where I'm teaching tens of thousands of people to also start AI businesses. Firstly, yes, I will admit that this is probably a big deal. The pattern is real here. A platform, a marketplace, a low barrier to entry means opportunity. I am not denying that.

### 📋 セクション 18

And over the next few years, these personal AI systems with skills that plug into them, I think is the platform that is really going to take us towards this AI future that we've always dreamed of. But here is the problem. This is what I call building your house on the sand. And you know the old story where the wise man built his house upon a rock and the foolish man built his house upon the sand. When the storm came, one house stood and the other one collapsed.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Right now, the skills ecosystem is sand. It's beautiful and exciting and shiny sand, but it's still sand. And here's why. Firstly, it's moving way too fast. The people who are going to win in this space are the absolutely cracked AI engineers who live on X, who ship code at 2 a.m.

### 📝 セクション 20

and have been doing this kind of stuff for years. And if that's not you, you're probably going to get eaten for lunch. And I know the vast majority of my audience is nontechnical, might be playing on the vibe coding platforms, but still, you're going to be at a massive disadvantage to the people who are really able to build these rapidly, who are actually got a proper development skill set. And honestly, by the time you figure out how to build one skill, they're going to have shipped 20 and be using AI agents to iterate on them faster than you can even think. Secondly, there's actually no proven money here yet.

### 💡 セクション 21

Yeah, it could be the next app store, but right now, nobody's making any real money. It's just all potential. A maybe. And a maybe is a terrible foundation for a newbie who's trying to get into starting an AI business. Thirdly, and this is a big one, businesses can't use this stuff yet.

### 🔧 セクション 22

The security just isn't there. It's been all sorts of talk about breaches and dangers. Compliance isn't there. The infrastructure isn't there for this yet. any serious company looking at OpenCore right now and saying cool call me in a year or two when this stuff's actually usable.

### 🎯 セクション 23

And here's what I've learned after 3 years in the space that the real money in AI isn't in building cute tools. Like sure, for some people, but the vast majority it is not there. It's actually in helping businesses to understand and adopt the stuff. If you think about it, there are tens of millions of businesses out there who don't understand AI that don't know how to use it and need someone to help them figure out what's actually useful for their situation, build it for them, and train their teams on it. And that problem has not changed over the past few years since I've been screaming from the freaking rooftops that this is how people should be getting into AI business.

### 💭 セクション 24

And the thing is, this problem is growing every single day. There are more and more businesses waking up and realizing that they need to take action on AI and do something about it. And they're getting their wallets out. We're even seeing this being reflected in stats across my community with the average deal size over the past 18 months growing 380% across my communities. And the best part about it is that anyone can learn to do this stuff even if you know nothing about AI or business right now.

### 📌 セクション 25

building some kind of AI services business or AI agency is the most proven path at this point into AI business including nontechnical and non-previous business owners. And guess what? When eventually skills and open claw and things like this become ready for businesses, when companies can safely deploy this stuff, someone's going to need to roll it out for them. Someone's going to need to set it up and integrate it into their systems to train people on how to use it to just explain what the hell it is. And if you look at it from a per employee basis, you can go into companies and charge 23 $4,000 per person to analyze how this person works to set up their personal assistant using something like OpenClaw and then teaching them how to use it.

### ✅ セクション 26

So there's a huge amount of money to be made if you are ready as an AI agency to be able to take your past clients or new clients and explain what this new platform is, consult with them to figure out the best configuration for their staff and then go in there and roll it out for them. This is exactly what we're planning to do at my agency, Morningside. I'm not losing my tit about this. I'm just chilling because I know that when this stuff does come around, if we keep working on how we work with our clients, learning to do consulting, learning to train their teams better, improving our development capabilities, then when this stuff comes, we're able to easily set it up and add it fast services for them. And you can be doing the exact same thing, but only if now you choose to build a real business and build some momentum with your agency rather than chasing this shiny object.

### 📚 セクション 27

And this is what I mean by building a house on the rock. Instead of chasing the experimental stuff that might disappear in the next month, you instead build cash flow. You build a real team. You build real skills and experience in helping businesses. You build real relationship with businesses who trust you.

### 🔖 セクション 28

And then when the skills open call thing matures, you are perfectly positioned to capture that way too. And I would bet everything I have that people will make more money through setting up these systems for businesses rather than trying to build specific skills. And then when the skills and open claw thing matures, you're perfectly positioned to capture that wave too. And that's like I said, that's what we're doing at Morningside. We're keeping an eye on all of this, but we're not abandoning what works in order to chase the sand.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, let me bring this home. The iPhone moment comparison, that's all real. There is a structural parallel happening here. And yes, some people are going to make a lot of money from Skills over the next few years. But like I said, I think by and large across the whole industry, there's going to be more money made in setting it up for companies than trying to build the little connectors and like software that is built around that on average.

### 🚀 セクション 30

But unless you're a technical builder who's very familiar with AI coding and using AI coding agents to move at lightning speed, that person probably isn't going to be you who gets to the few skills that actually do pop off and make a lot of money. The smarter play, especially if you're just getting into AI, you want to start a business and an income stream, is to build a real foundation first based on the AI agency model. Through this, you get to learn how businesses actually use a technology. You learn how to identify opportunities through them by running AI audits. You learn how to deliver solutions and get paid for it.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And that's the AI agency model. And it has been working for tens of thousands of regular people over the past few years. Not because it's shiny or sexy, but because it solves a real problem for tens of millions of companies across the world that isn't going away. Because what very few people realize right now is that the AI adoption problem in companies isn't a technology problem. It's not that the technology isn't good enough.

### 🌟 セクション 32

It's actually a human problem. And it's a it's a process problem. There simply aren't enough AI agencies out there to help businesses to move through this AI transformation process. It's very much human issues. It's hey, oh, we have a couple people in the organization who don't want to adopt the stuff or going to make it hard or need training or are not very technical.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And getting through those human problems is what's really slowing down AI adoption right now. And that's how you know that building one of these businesses is a far more stable foundation because you're going to move as fast as the people actually adopt it rather than the speed of the technology advancing itself. So that's why myself and all of my community is going to be building on the rock for the next few years rather than focusing on the shining object in the sand. And so if you actually want to get started with an AI services or AI agency business, I've actually put together a full free course here on YouTube that breaks down exactly how to build an AI business in 2026. Whether you want to go down a non-technical consulting route, whether you want to build AI automations yourself, that video will be linked up here and in the first link in the description, and that's the same one that's helped thousands of people in my community actually make money with AI, not by following a trend, but by following a proven blueprint that has been used by tens of thousands of people before them over the past few years to build a real AI business as a non-technical or even nonAI person.

### 📋 セクション 34

The link to that full course is going to be in the description. You can watch it free. And look, if you're one of those crack technical people who can move fast with the skill space, go for it. Seriously, have a crack, but just know what you're getting into. But for everyone else, I highly recommend that you build your house on the rock.

### ⭐ セクション 35

With the rest of us, the storms are coming. They always do in AI. So, you just got to make sure you're still standing when they pass. That's all for the video, guys. You can watch that full free course up here.

### 📝 セクション 36

That's all. and I'll see you in the next one.
