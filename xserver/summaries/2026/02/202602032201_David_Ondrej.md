### 🎬 導入

Startup founders and CEOs cannot hesitate. The worst thing you can do as a founder is to hesitate. Often times you're dealt with two terrible choices, right? Both option A and option B are very difficult and very ugly. But the worst thing you can do is not decide and kind of, you know, put the problem to the side and try to delay it.

### 📋 背景・概要

That is the worst thing. And it's a advice from Ben Horowitz, the founder of Andre Horovitz, which is one of the most successful VC investment firms in the world. And yeah, the worst mistake a startup founder can make is to hesitate. So when you have two difficult decisions and both of them seem very bad and very ugly, just pick one and move fast. Do not hesitate.
