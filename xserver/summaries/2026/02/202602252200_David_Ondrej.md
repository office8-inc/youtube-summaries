## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Open Claw is the next evolution of NA10. If you think about it, going back to previous automations like Zapir, make.com, they were just automation software, right? But the next evolution was NA10 with their powerful AI agent that you can insert into your automation to make decisions and do stuff, right? The issue is that it was still automation first. You build automation, you add AI agent later.

### 📋 背景・概要

But it turns out that all along the best approach was AI agent first, right? Look at what Open Claw is. It's a powerful AI agent that you give access to your WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Gmail, and it can create clone jobs, store markdown files, and if you tell it, check my email at 7:00 a.m. every day, and at then at 9:00 a.m. send me a concise report of the top 10 most important emails, it will create the automation by itself.
