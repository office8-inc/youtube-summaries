## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

This open source project was loved then hated by developers then loved again. Reddus was created in 2009 by Salvatore Sanfalippo that unlike traditional databases store data in memory while using more than just key value pairs. Companies like Instagram and GitHub use it extensively in their stacks and even to this day it's used widely. One of the most popular ways to run Reddus in the cloud was through Reddus Labs, a completely separate entity. And so in 2015, Reddis Labs hired Salvatore to lead development.

### 📋 背景・概要

But then in 2024, they changed their license from being permissive to no longer being open- source. And the internet went absolutely nuts. This prompted the Linux Foundation to fork it completely and create Valky. Salvatore that same year would rejoin Reddus and work as an evangelist. Ever since, Reddit has slowly come back on its word.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

They walked it back, adding open- source licensing again. But developers don't forget that easily. It took Reddus 15 years to build up the trust that they had, but it took one day to knock it back down to zero. What do you think? Fall for more.
