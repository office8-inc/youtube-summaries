### 🎬 導入

In business, one of the simplest ways to improve is tracking. Are you tracking your revenue, your landing page visits, your traffic, your conversion rates? This is so important and so obvious. And this also applies to life. There have been literally studies that people lose weight just by weighing themsel every morning.

### 📋 背景・概要

It's that simple. And you will be more conscious and more aware. And the same goes for business. If your AI business isn't tracking how much you're spending, how many visits your landing page is getting, the number of users you have, what's your current monthly churn, if you cannot name metrics from the top of your head, you're not really serious about business and you're going to get out competed and destroyed.
