## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so we are back again uh with another video where we are going to actually try to use some upskilling for our AI agent. That basically just means that we're going to create a new skill. So today I thought uh I need a skill to kind of promote some kind of product I have. For me it's just a simple skills md.store uh service I provide. So basically this is just it's not like specific to my thing but it's just going to be like a general thing how you can upskill your agent to create this promotional product videos.

### 📋 背景・概要

This could be anything you want to kind of promote I guess. So today I'm just going to go through kind of how I use um claude code to set up this skill so we can repeat it over time. So I'm just going to walk you through the process. Like I said I have like a dedicated AI agent on my Mac Mini. So, we're going to go over there.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So, if you haven't watched my previous two videos on this, uh, if you want to catch up, you can go do that. But for now, let's just head over to the Mac Mini and let's try to, yeah, do some skill training on the agent to see if we can actually make some kind of good way to produce like a simple but effective promo video. Okay, so in my case, this is what we're going to try to promote. This is skills md.store, like I said. So, basically, this is like a claude code skills you could purchase, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

I don't know how big this is going to be. I'm not quite sure, but I just wanted to test it out. So, for now, I just have one skill. This is just how to automate or let uh your AI agent control your X account, right? So, if we click here, you just get taken to like some kind of Stripe and you just pay and you get the MD file, right?

### 💡 実例・デモ

And you can just plug that MD file into your uh claw uh skills here. And you should be able to use basically you end up with this file. And you can see here if you zoom in a bit, this makes you navigate and post on X using browser automation. And you don't really need the API key, right? That is basically the ID.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So we might do an example of that, but basically that is the product we're going to try to promote. Okay. So, the way we're going to do this is uh we need to create a skill for this. So, the way I like to train the agent on this is just doing this iterative like I did in the previous videos. And for each step, we do things, right?

### 🎯 応用例

We save that workflow to an skill file. Okay. So, I think for this part here, we kind of want to do like a video. So, we want to do voice over, we want to do some remotion, maybe some screen capture. We'll see how we're going to do this and what we can end up with.

### 💭 考察

So, I think we're just going to go to Claude here, right? And I'm going to use the dangerous script permission. And if we go to skills, you can see, yeah, we have a bunch of skills here. So, we want to take some advantage of some of these. We have screen recording.

### 📌 まとめ

We can kind of use this. And we have, of course, the XMD file we're going to use. And, yeah, video editing. Maybe we use some of that. We'll see.

### ✅ 結論

Uh but basically so I think I'm just going to come up with a prompt here now uh just to try to describe I'm going to uh talk a bit about what this product is and let's try to create kind of the first iteration. Okay. So this is the prompt I kind of came up with here. So I'm going to read this out. If you want to skip ahead that's fine.

### 📚 追加情報

So uh we need to learn a new skill pro product promo. Uh in our case, this is a simple web page that sells skills for AI agents, akll.md files with instructions and I just link to claude skills, right? Uh we do already have some skill that can help us uh use uh create a promo video like voice over, screen recording. We have some video editing skills we already have trained. So, the ideal promo video should be like a short uh video and on point just describing what the service do uh aka you buy a prepared AI agent skill uh that works out of the box uh like the x.com skill I have on the page.

### 🔖 補足

This will save you time on iteration just to figure out how your AI agent can interact or navigate using X. For the video, it would be great if you could screen record you navigating X just to show off so maybe we can get some screen recording of the skill working in practice. Create a voice over that describe and sell the skill MD store uh product. Use Remotion for smooth animation, transitions, text. Uh we have background music file.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So I'm just going to tag that chill.mpp3. Please create your first iteration of the promo video and we can take it from there. So that is all I'm going to do now. And when we get something back, we can kind of uh create the skill.md file for this. We can call it just promo product, I guess.

### 🚀 セクション 14

And then we can iterate and update this file until we have something that works. So I'm just going to run this now. And this is probably going to take some time just to get the first iteration. So I'm going to take you back when we have something here. And from there, we're just going to iterate and see if we end up with some kind of skill or product or video that we are quite happy with.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And then we're going just going to iterate and see if this skill is something we can use in the future. Okay. So, you can see now the agent is actually doing the screen recording, I think. And it's going to X just to show off how the skill works, I guess. So, it's just going to do some screen recording on navigating, I think.

### 🌟 セクション 16

We'll see where this ends up. So, it just went here and I'm going to see if it's going to do anything else here now. Yeah. So, now it went to notifications. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And yeah, it's probably just going to go to compose. I don't know. Hopefully, it's not going to do a post. We'll see. But, uh yeah, basically, I think this is just a screen recording of uh how the agent is navigating uh the website here.

### 📋 セクション 18

Okay. So, now you can kind of see uh Claude here is writing. some uh remotion skills here. This is just for the video editing, I think. And now it's just going to probably just going to do a promo mp4.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So, it's going to render this video. So, this is probably going to be our first iteration. And you can see we only have spent so far 4 minutes on trying to do this skill. So, this is probably going to be our first iteration. And then we're going to try to iterate and correct what we liked and what we didn't like, I guess.

### 📝 セクション 20

Okay. Okay. So now you can see uh to watch the video, we can go here. But first uh I just want to uh do the skill.md file. So we kind of have that nailed down.

### 💡 セクション 21

And I'm just going to update uh yeah, I'm just going to show you here. So I'm just going to say uh let's create a skill.md file under claw skills uh under promo skill MD with the workflow you used to end up with the video. So we can reuse this in the future. So before we watch it, I'm just going to do this. And this makes it a bit easier to iterate uh when we do some changes to the promo video unless it's perfect the first time.

### 🔧 セクション 22

We'll see. Okay. So now you can see we have generated the skill uh MD file. And this is create a short promotional video for a product service. Combine screen recording, voice over, reotion animation, background music video into a polish promo clip.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Yeah, I guess that's good. So, I think we're just going to play the first iteration now to see how well it went. And from there, we're just going to try to iterate and improve it. Play the video. Okay.

### 💭 セクション 24

So, let's see how it turned out. What if your AI agent could already navigate X.com, post content, reply to comments, and manage your entire social presence without you spending hours figuring out the right prompts? Working Okay, so I would say that was a pretty good start. Uh, we need to iterate though because the first it was very slow and it didn't include anything from the web page and I wanted to do some more screen recording of it actually navigating X. So now we're going to do some feedback.

### 📌 セクション 25

Okay. So, I'm just going to come up with the feedback I have from the first iteration and then it's going to try to do a second iteration and then we're going to update the skill MD file if we like that one. So, now I'm just going to do the feedback here. Okay. So, this is the feedback I have.

### ✅ セクション 26

So, I'm good start but some issues. First, you need to do a voice over for the full video explaining the concept. Here you can see the agent navigatingx.com and yeah, you can basically read here if you want to pause and see all the feedback I gave it. But basically, I just said I want to iterate on something, maybe do some more animations. I want to show off the web page and stuff like that.

### 📚 セクション 27

So now I'm just going to say uh create a second iteration and we will kind of take it from there. So yeah, now we're just going to do the second iteration. We're going to take a look at that and maybe update the skill MD file if we like some of the changes we did. And then we're just going to yeah, see if there's anything else we need to do. It doesn't need to be perfect, but I just want some good promotional video we can save as a skill here.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So, now we can see we have our second iteration here. And already I kind of see something I really don't like. I think we shouldn't start with the X demo here. But, uh, but yeah, let's just watch the second iteration now. And it should be much shorter.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Just 26 seconds. That's good. So, yeah, let's just watch it. >> Watch this. My AI agent navigating X.com, checking notifications, looking at profiles, drafting posts, fully autonomous.

### 🚀 セクション 30

This is a skill. Plug it in and your agent knows exactly what to do. Skinsomed.store. Ready-made skills. Pick one, pay with Stripe, done.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Skip the trial and error. skins.tore. >> You know what? I actually like it. I think this was very good to be honest.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I like how fast it felt, right? So, we just started here, but I thought it was pretty good, but I kind of like the hook here. So, watch this. And we just could go through fast everything navigating X. And then we go to the page.

### 🎬 セクション 33

This is a skill. Plug it in. Skip the trial and error. I think I like it. I think this was pretty good.

### 📋 セクション 34

Uh, for now, I'm kind of happy with this. I don't think we nearly need anything else for this now. So, we might expand this skill in the future, but for now, I think I'm pretty happy with this. So, now I'm just going to say, uh, very good. This is it.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Update skill.md so we can use this workflow in the future. So, we're going to do that. Then, I'm going to exit Claude. We're going to load up the skill. We're going to try to do it one more time just to see how precise we can recreate this by just giving it uh the URL here.

### 📝 セクション 36

Okay, so that was done. So now I'm just going to exit here, right? So I'm just going to kind of complete this clear. I'm going to go with skip permissions again. And now let's actually try to recreate this and um by just using the skill we learned.

### 💡 セクション 37

And we're going to give it a URL, right? And from there, let's see how close we kind of get to the iterated version of this. Okay. So, I'm just going to say something like uh we need to promote promo and I'm just going to do my URL. Use the promo skill to create the video.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Okay. So, let's try that and let's see how this turns out now. So, I want to see if we load up the skill first we learned. So, let's see if we load the skill. Yeah, we loaded the promo skill.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Perfect. And I'm just going to let this run and we're going to take a look at kind of the final output here now. Yeah, let's see how it turns out. Okay, so you can see now we are rendering kind of the final uh video here. So, we should soon have kind of the Yeah, I guess this is kind of the final version of the skill because now we didn't do any an iteration.

### 💭 セクション 40

We just used the instruction we had in our skill MD file. So hopefully this is as good as the first iteration. So I hope the length is around the same time. Maybe like 20 30 seconds. Yeah, it looks pretty good.

### 📌 セクション 41

And it should be done now. So let's just watch it and hopefully Yeah, it's 26 seconds again. Perfect. So let's see how close this came to kind of our iterated version. >> Watch this.

### ✅ セクション 42

My AI agent navigating ex.com. Checking notifications, looking up profiles, drafting posts, fully autonomous. This is a skill. Plug it in and your agent knows exactly what to do. Skills MD.store.

### 📚 セクション 43

Readymade skills for cloud code. Pick one. Pay with Stripe. Done. Skip the trial and error.

### 🔖 セクション 44

skillsmd.store. >> Yeah, I think that was pretty similar, right? And I like the length. I like the tempo. I kind of like the graphics.

### 🎨 セクション 45

It's not perfect, but it's good enough for like an automated promo video. So, I'm pretty happy with this. So, I'm gonna keep this skill and for each time I kind of do like an update on my Skills MD store and it would be interesting to test this on another product. But, uh, for now, I just think I'm going to do this. Uh, and if I have like another product in the future, we're gonna try it on that.

### 🚀 セクション 46

But, uh, yeah, I'm super happy how this turned out. I was a bit unsure how well it's going to do, but uh yeah. So, basically what we could do now is just uh great. Um let's post this uh the promo video on X. Uh include a URL and a short text description, something like that.

### ⚡ セクション 47

And this could be like a follow-up if we wanted to kind of add this to the skill too. We could have that agent creates the promo video and then post it on some kind of social media. So now we're just going to go to X, right? And you can see how this works. Now we're just going to inject the video using CDF, I guess.

### 🌟 セクション 48

And okay, so you can see uh yeah, we pushed in the video here and that is the video we created. Perfect. 26 seconds. It's just going to process. We need to add some text, I guess, and the URL.

### 🎬 セクション 49

So, hopefully the URL now is going to be the skills MD.ST store. We'll see. And that should be pretty much it. Yeah, we use some script here to input the text. Skills store MD skills MD.ST store.

### 📋 セクション 50

Perfect. Yeah, I'm happy with this. Skills for CL code agents automation. Plug it in. And we have the video.

### ⭐ セクション 51

We have the link URL. Okay. Yeah, that's a nice promotion, I guess, and we posted it. So, you can see this could be done autonomously now if you have all of these skills set up. So, yeah, again, just a very interesting way of uh utilizing your uh employee agent.

### 📝 セクション 52

So, for me, this is kind of the dedicated Mac Mini I set up for this. So, I don't have any like uh what do you call it like uh my data. So the agent has uh its own email, its own X account, its own Yeah, everything is is not related to me, right? So yeah, you can see we have the post here. Perfect.

### 💡 セクション 53

Okay, so I would say that went bit better than I thought to be honest. It was very easy to set it up. So, for the upcoming weeks, I think we're just going to keep expanding our library of skills, and we're going to find interesting way to combine the skills we already know to test this out, just to see where this takes us. I don't really have like a a specific goal about this. Uh, I had some success with running a YouTube channel using this skills, so I might do a video on that.

### 🔧 セクション 54

We'll see. Um, and yeah, basically if you want to follow along how my agent is doing over the next few weeks, months, give this video a like and subscribe and I will update you how this goes. And hopefully you can learn something. Maybe this gave you some inspiration to start up your own agentic project today. And there's yeah, I just dipped the toes into what we can do now.

### 🎯 セクション 55

I even had it do GitHub, so it's doing code projects, posting this and stuff. So that is also pretty interesting. But yeah, that was what I had for today. Hope you enjoyed it. Hope this gave you some inspiration.

### 💭 セクション 56

And I'll see you again. Yeah, probably in just a few days.
