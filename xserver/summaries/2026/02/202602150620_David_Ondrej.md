## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Agent Zero is the world's first AI super agent. It's open source, secure, private, runnable locally, and you can use it completely for free. In this video, I brought on Jana, the founder of Agent Zero, to ask what makes Agent Zero so powerful. What is the future direction for AI agents and how does Agent Zero compare to OpenClaw? Most people are still not aware of what Agent Zero can do.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, if you want to have an unfair advantage over everyone else, make sure to watch until the end. All right. So Yan is going to show how Agent Zero can launch and manage its own servers inside of itself. And this is just one of the many amazing use cases that Agent Zero can do. Exactly.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

I did some testing just uh this morning. Now I have a website for agent zero that runs on a public URL and agent zero can manage and maintain this completely from the inside including installation backup managing the content and I even gave it my API key for open router and it created this page inside the website for image generation using nano banana pro. So the main thing is that it's running inside of agent zero because people have seen like you know models oneshot front ends but here we're talking about a fundamentally different thing. >> Yeah. Yeah.

### 📝 詳細説明

We flipped the concept around a bit here. Agent zero lives inside its own virtual Linux operating system. So agent zero runs in a docker container and it's installed as a part of Linux operating system. So what I did here is I told agent zero you will install WordPress and the database and PHP and and all the dependencies inside yourself and then just expose the WordPress on the port 9000 and uh I have a very basic setup on Hostinger. I purchased a very cheap VPS for something like $7 and uh I just did a mapping of my public URL to one of the containers inside.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So very basic setup uh no preparation uh basically all of that was zero shot and what I have now is a working website that the agent can manage. >> So yes can you show that from scratch how people could do it? >> This is how completely fresh agent zero instance looks like. >> So it's the new UI. >> Yeah we have completely redesigned the UI.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So now it's it's much more readable and clean and so this is how a fresh instance of agent zero looks like. I don't have any chats tasks files for this particular use case. I did not put any instructions in or anything. All I did was set up my open router API key so that I can use entropic models. So let me start a new chat and tell the agent install WordPress directly in your Linux.

### 🎯 応用例

>> And which model is it running right now? >> It will be opus 4.6 I believe. So one shot like this. No preparation. So the agent started with installing all of the Linux stuff, PHP, Apache server, MySQL database.

### 💭 考察

Then it started the MySQL database and now it's proceeding with downloading WordPress and configuring WordPress and we should see the website running soon. >> So again, let's uh touch on a bit of the architecture of agent zero, right? It has full access to Linux. You don't need to tell it how to do it like which libraries to use, which commands to use. >> Yes.

### 📌 まとめ

The difference between agent zero and other agents is that you do not install agent zero directly on your hardware. You don't install it directly in your operating system. You can run it perfectly locally. You can self-host it anywhere. It's in a Docker container.

### ✅ 結論

But that's the big difference that agent zero is isolated in its Docker container. It has its own Kali Linux system to deal with. So it's sandboxed. You can still exchange files with it. You can map folders.

### 📚 追加情報

So it has a ton of connectivity but by default it's isolated inside its own Linux. So uh none of the installation here is polluting my computer or my server. It is isolated in this docker container. Now this is done and uh this is the public URL. So we can test and yeah WordPress is running but uh I can immediately see that it's missing CSS styles here.

### 🔖 補足

I didn't tell agent zero that I'm going to be using an HTTPS proxy from the outside. So the agent didn't know that. I'm just going to copy paste the error from the browser console and let the agent deal with it. It should be an easy fix. >> So let's talk about more the future directions on where AI agents are headed.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Right? You touched on a bit that the server management and the service management in the future will be done by agents. So do you have any more thoughts on this? Because people struggle to look into the future. So much is happening right now.

### 🚀 セクション 14

>> I also struggle to look into the future, right? Like it's very uncertain right now. It everything moves so fast. But I can see two major directions where a AI agents are headed. And uh one will most probably be personal agents like personal assistance so that you have your agent running either on your computer at your home or on your phone or in the cloud or somewhere it will most probably even become native part of the most consumer operating system like Mac OS and Windows.

### ⚡ セクション 15

We've probably all heard the scenarios like where your agent communicates to other agents of other people and schedule meetings and and do reservations and stuff like that. So yeah, this is probably inevitable. But the other direction I see is uh more of a utility. Probably most of the services that are deployed online right now we can call them dump services, right? Those are operating systems running services >> with human oversight from time to time, right?

### 🌟 セクション 16

some logging, maybe some error inspection, but it's how it was 10, 20 years ago. Server is running. Unless the server fails, there's nothing we do about it. >> Yeah, maybe there's a memory leak, but on until it, you know, surpasses the memory, nobody will notice. >> Yeah, of course.

### 🎬 セクション 17

>> What do you think the future will look like? Like every Linux server will have an agent zero inside of it and then it will notice like >> maybe not directly inside of it. Maybe it will be side by side because for example, agent zero can connect to any system using SSH, right? So a single agent zero instance can observe many of your servers sshing into them and it can schedule tasks like like every hour I will check the health and traffic of all the servers and and spot any anything suspicious there. So it doesn't necessarily need to be directly within the agents instance like it is now.

### 📋 セクション 18

But most probably most of the services in the cloud in the future will be enhanced or augmented by AI agents that will do the monitoring and the maintenance. Okay, so the error is fixed. Uh okay, this is the last step of WordPress installation. So let's just give it a title, username. Let's copy the password, email, and it's done.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So now I have a fully functional website running inside of my agent zero. Uh speaking of uh the maintenance, I can show you right now. Good. Now make a backup of all the files and the database. Then schedule task to do the backup every eight hours.

### 📝 セクション 20

Here we can see the thoughts. The agent will always first tell me what it's going to do in inside its thoughts. So it wants to create a backup script and then schedule it every eight hours. But it will not schedule the script itself. Like we could do this in Linux.

### 💡 セクション 21

We could we could schedule a chron job to run the script itself. But instead what agent zero does is it first verifies that it works and then it schedules an agentic task every eight hours. And we can see tasks here below chats. Tasks in agent zero are periodic tasks or they can be ad hoc or they can be planned to fire once. But this one is periodic.

### 🔧 セクション 22

It will run every eight hours. And what it does basically is it wakes up an agent and it it gives him the system prompt. You are a system administrator responsible for running WordPress. This was generated by by agent zero and a task run the WordPress backup script. It tells it where the backup script is.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Verif verify that the backup was successful, right? And report back. We can run it manually now. And take a look. So this is how it looks.

### 💭 セクション 24

It's basically just another agent zero chat. So the agent wakes up, gets this instruction, executes the backup, and then goes back to sleep again. And the huge benefit of this is that if there was an error during the backup, the agent will immediately see and react and maybe fix the script. And I if it's uh if it's not possible to fix it, it would probably notify me using the notification system or it would do something or it would at least try, right? If your chron job fails again you need to have monitoring you need to find out that you don't have any backups etc.

### 📌 セクション 25

>> Someone needs to notice it and then you know human hours need to go into it. >> Yeah. And so now yeah we have the backup folder we have the backup and we should have two backups by now. Yeah. Perfect.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh of course this is backing it up inside its own file system. If I wanted to make it more resilient I would tell it to use something like FTP and upload the backup somewhere. But for us now it's good enough because we have a backup. we can now mess around with the WordPress and if we break something we can restore it from a backup. So basically the advantage because everybody keeps asking me like how to get advantage in the age of AI right so the advantage will go to people and companies who can figure out how to effectively deploy these agents into their current workflows operations systems basically what you need to do now in any IT business is save man hours right do more with less people or do more with the same amount of people because uh AI is or it is still understaffed so you probably want to do more with the people you already have.

### 📚 セクション 27

>> Yeah. Increase output per human. >> Yeah. And this is exactly it. But if you can offload some of that to AI which will cost you I don't know $10 a day maybe to do these tasks like uh check the logs if there is anything suspicious make a backup etc.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Right? You can do this very cheaply. >> Show like the intelligent model management. Right? Instead of using the same model for everything in the settings we can customize this more.

### 🎨 セクション 29

>> Okay. So we have the chat model setting in agent zero and this is the model you want to set to something smart not necessarily the biggest and most expensive but something that will be reliably capable of handling your task. This is the main thinking model. This is what controls the chat. This is what writes all the code that is being executed.

### 🚀 セクション 30

It writes all the tool instructions and everything. So this is the model you directly speak to and that decides what's going to happen. >> So if if this one is like not powerful then everything else is way less powerful because some people have like a cheap computer and they try running local models like 7B 8B models and then they complain that their results are not the best. >> Yeah, there are eight or nine billion parameter models that can technically run the system. So like they will not immediately fail.

### ⚡ セクション 31

they will be able to execute some code and respond etc. But uh you cannot compare 8 billion parameter model to something that's like one or two trillion right like yeah the difference is so vast that >> you can try it it will probably be a nice toy but you you cannot expect much even models like 70 80b this is quite a complex system so it has a a lot of tools it has a lot of options a lot of instructions so you probably need something that can handle a lot of instruction and long context windows Yeah. So if people want to get the most out of agent zero, they should use a strong model for the chat model. >> Yeah. It doesn't necessarily need to be very expensive.

### 🌟 セクション 32

There is a lot of open source models. >> Kim K 2.5. Yeah. GLM5, Miniax M 2.5. >> Yeah.

### 🎬 セクション 33

And uh even Gemini Flash can handle the main model. It will not be as good as as Gemini Pro, but it can. That's the chat model. And then uh we have a utility model. And utility model should be something small and cheap or uh fast and cheap.

### 📋 セクション 34

It doesn't need to be small but it should be something fast and cheap. And this handles all the utility tasks in the background like for example organizing the memory. So agent zero has a very complex memory system running in the background. It automatically recalls memories and injects them into the context window. And it does the same the other way around.

### ⭐ セクション 35

It memorizes successful solutions and data from the conversation and stores it in the database and uh we have a very advanced summarization system for the context window itself. So >> this was like very innovative right when it came out. >> Yeah. Because actually a lot of services maybe even most services to this day what they do if when they run out of context is that they will simply start discarding the oldest messages, right? But it can contain very important data.

### 📝 セクション 36

So what we do instead and I made a I made a very detailed video about it on our YouTube channel. >> We can link it below >> is that uh we take the utility model and we start summarizing the chat from the oldest messages. So we have the chat already organized into sections or topics where you tell the agent something and the agent starts working on it and this can be considered a a topic or a section. And it has different rules for organizing different topics based on their age. For example, the oldest topics can be summarized extremely into maybe like one paragraph of text, right?

### 💡 セクション 37

So you can be talking to agent zero for dozens of hours and it will not simply discard messages. It will start summarizing them more and more the more obsolete they get. And so what we do for example to optimize the most current topic we always leave the first message and the few last messages and we can summarize something in between right. So imagine if we have a very long chain like imagine that there were hundreds of steps in between. So we still need the first message that I sent to agent zero so that agent zero knows the original topic.

### 🔧 セクション 38

It needs to have the tail of the conversation. So it knows what it's doing right now, but everything in between can probably be summarized. It probably doesn't need to know every single detail of every single step like these installation packages. So over time these messages in between will get summarized more and more and then full topics will get summarized and then we group them into chunks and then we summarize chunks. So over time we get a 100x or a thousandx compression ratio by summarizing more and more.

### 🎯 セクション 39

The utility model is instructed to to try to preserve any important details like for example if you use some identifiers or uh remote locations or something like that. So it will probably either save it to the long-term memory or it will summarize it but keep the important details inside. That's what we use the utility model for. So we do something about like five or eight utility model calls per one main model call. So this can tell you something about the ratio that should be between them.

### 💭 セクション 40

This should be something fast and cheap. >> Yeah. >> So that it doesn't slow the system down. It doesn't cost too much but it can handle the backbone of the framework. And that's the reason we invented this dual s dual model system so that you don't pay too much and you don't wait too much for the main model to do everything.

### 📌 セクション 41

>> All right. So that's the utility model. >> Yep. We also have a dedicated dedicated model for the browser use framework but I have it set to the same as uh to the same as the main model but this controls the browser. So maybe some models are better suited for browser use experience, right?

### ✅ セクション 42

You probably want something that supports vision so that it can visually see the website. Websites are cluttered with text. I mean the DOM of the website. >> Yeah, >> the HTML behind it, those are like megabytes of text, but the thing you see is probably just a few paragraphs. So >> yeah, you you might want to experiment with this.

### 📚 セクション 43

So basically agent zero gives people way more control over which models they're using, how many tokens they're burning. >> Yeah, I I would say it gives you more control over everything like uh you can customize the whole memory system how it works. You can see and edit all the memories that have been generated, right? You can search them. >> Let's let's explain the memory system like with the vector database.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So there's a built-in vector database in agent zero and uh we have different memory subdirectories that you can customize. I can get to the project system later but if you create a dedicated project it can have a dedicated memory as well and implicitly in the background agent zero memorizes what it does. So for example here we can see it memorized some technical details about the WordPress that we just installed on port 9000 right it shows the version of the database it used it stored the username and password maybe this is not a best practice to store it in memory but I will get to the uh secrets management system we have later >> so again this is automatic so this is you don't have to tell it to memorize this >> no no this happens even the main shut model it doesn't control it right this happens implic implicitly. And uh this was inspired by how human brain works, right? When you recall memories, it happens automatically, right?

### 🎨 セクション 45

You don't need to focus to know how to do something you did in the past, right? It pops up automatically and the same way you memorize things. >> So then when you talk about the same topic, it loads up the nearest memories. >> Yeah. Yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 46

based uh based on the similarity to the topic you are discussing. It will load relevant memories from the vector database and uh we also have an embedding model that is embedded inside agent zero. This is running locally on the CPU. You can change it to any remote embedding model. This is used for the vector database for embedding text into the vector database.

### ⚡ セクション 47

But you don't have to change it. This runs completely locally on the CPU. So your memories are not unnecessarily exposed to another LLM provider to another endpoint etc. >> So that's like the agent zero ideology like philosophy, right? >> Maximum privacy, maximum security, >> maximum control.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Yeah. If we don't need to expose anything, we don't. That is for example what's great about the secrets management. I I will show it in practice in a minute, but this is this is something very powerful that every AI agent should have. >> So the memory system allows agent zero basically to improve over time as it knows you better >> and you don't even have to do anything.

### 🎬 セクション 49

>> Exactly. It learns on the fly. It learns on the fly. So if you do something that's not in the model's training data, if it sees something for the very first time, if you plug it to a completely new system, it learns over time. You can also tell agent zero to for example adjust its behavior.

### 📋 セクション 50

If you tell agent zero to do something differently like I don't know always call me sir or something like that, it has a dedicated area inside memory. It will call you can do this. Uh okay. Uh change your behavior. Always call me sir.

### ⭐ セクション 51

>> So a specific tool for this, right? >> Uh yeah, there's a specific tool for this. It will write it into a persistent area in the memory that is always injected into the system prompt. And now even if I start a new chat and say hi, >> there it is. Remembered it.

### 📝 セクション 52

>> Oh, here it is. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Also uh can we show like can we explain the sub agent structure right because agent zero is not just the name it's the main agent that you're talking to so it can spawn agent one agent two >> yeah uh in agent agent zero is called agent zero because agent zero is the first agent you talk to and every agent in agent zero has its superior agent and it can have its subordinate agents. So in programming for people who are not familiar every list starts with zero and not one.

### 💡 セクション 53

>> Yeah. And I called it agent zero because agent zero is the agent you talk to as the user. Right. Uh for the agent you are its superior agent. It doesn't really know the difference between a superior agent and a human user.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It doesn't really care if I tell agent zero uh call subordinate to tell you a joke. We can see the flow. So agent zero will call subordinate and it will start agent one. Agent one sees the conversation as like his user telling him to tell a joke and it responds to agent zero and then agent zero responds to me. Uh the the original thought behind this separation into a chain of agents was to isolate the context window because if you have a big task like if you have a big system to maintain or a big project to develop the context window grows really fast and this way agent zero can act as the orchestrator and it can delegate subtasks to subordinate agents.

### 🎯 セクション 55

And for the subordinate agent, it's a completely new chat. The subordinate agent doesn't have all the context that its superior agent has. So it only knows what the superior agent tells it. >> And it's using the >> chat model as well. >> Yeah.

### 💭 セクション 56

Yeah. It's using the chat model as well. Uh different subordinate agents can use different chat models. Uh we are just developing a UI configuration for that for the next version. Right now it's done in configuration files but uh yeah they can have their own configuration.

### 📌 セクション 57

They can even have their own specialization. So they can have the different profiles with different prompts. They can have different tools and they can even have different system extensions. So for example, every time uh a developer agent is running its communication loop at a certain point, we can have an extension that will I don't know check git status or something like that in the background without without the agent consciously uh consciously manipulating it. And so the biggest reason like I said is uh context isolation.

### ✅ セクション 58

So that for example right now agent one was telling a joke but agent one could be I don't know building a scaffolding for some project and it could take hundreds of steps but from agent zero's perspective it would be like I told agent one to build this and agent one responded it's now built and tested and agent >> analyze a massive repo with hundreds of files >> like you mentioned recently right that was a new use case for the version like seeing what changes between versions. So like there's going to be a lot of context that's not relevant to the main agent. >> That's that's a good use case. I told agent zero something like uh clone agent0 AI/ agent0 and uh go through the comets between tags 097 and 09 098 and give me a summary of all the changes. Like this was a big version and we had something like 400 comets in between these two versions.

### 📚 セクション 59

>> So many hours doing that manually. >> Yeah, probably several hours doing that manually. And so I told Zero to just clone the repository and go through the comets, right? And it will see the list of comets. I can probably tell it list all at once because otherwise it would have to click enter every time.

### 🔖 セクション 60

>> So explain this as well. You can give context as it's running. >> Yeah. Yeah. Uh sorry I didn't tell that.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Uh yeah. When agent zero is running and you type another message. Uh I can press enter twice and send it immediately as an intervention or okay I did I did the other thing right now. So >> deleted it. >> Yeah.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Uh >> it goes into cute list but if you do another >> when I press enter once it goes into Q list and once once it's done the agent will receive >> another message. So right now it will probably just ask me like what did I what did I mean with this? Or I can press enter again now and it will cause an intervention. So the agent will stop what it was doing and it will react to the message immediately. >> When you forget to give important context, you can easily >> this way I can either build a task list.

### ⚡ セクション 63

So I can tell it may maybe good example is check system health CPU RAM into terminal calls just to make it longer so we have time to intervene. And I can say and then disk and it will go into the queue and when the agent is done checking the CPU and RAM it will then receive the other message and and here it is and it will proceed. So based on what you want, sometimes you maybe want to intervene immediately if you see the agent had it in the wrong direction or if you forgot to tell it something and you want to give it the information immediately. You can send the queue or you can build up a stack of tasks, right? Sometimes you want to do something like this.

### 🌟 セクション 64

When you're finished, do this and then this and then this and it will receive it one by one. Okay. Uh yeah, and here is the summary of changes between versions 097 and 098 we just did. So it took just one minute here. >> So what else is new in this update?

### 🎬 セクション 65

Because you mentioned it's a big update. >> Yeah. Uh we completely redesigned the UI. So now it's much more sleek. We also redesigned completely the communication layer between front end and the back end of Agent Zero.

### 📋 セクション 66

So previously it was more efficient. It used polling. Now it uses a websocket communication. So that even developers can now develop new websocket endpoints. We will use this for additional features.

### ⭐ セクション 67

We will be shipping next to agent zero like CLI connector and uh what do we call it the the runtime wrapper that we want to build the single operating system native application that will run agent zero still in docker but inside of it with all the windows windows showing you all your instances letting you manage launcher I couldn't I couldn't remember the word launcher so AO launcher and all of this will be communicating with the new websocket system one of the big changes is that now we have cloud skills. >> Maybe let's explain this because not everybody understands skills. It's a relatively new abstraction. >> Yeah, skills are tools for agents. But unlike native tools or MCPS, skills are basically folders containing instruction files and then they can contain executable scripts or some other assets.

### 📝 セクション 68

I don't know files, images, whatever it needs. So maybe you have a skill for example like for the WordPress management uh we can download some skills that have some CLI tools and markdown files with instructions inside the agent will load the skill read the instructions and then it can use the scripts and the way it uses the tool is that it executes the scripts or the commands inside its terminal. So it needs to be an agent that has access to terminal. So something like agent zero or cloud code that has access to terminal and then it can execute these tools not natively inside its runtime but inside inside any terminal the agent can control and uh the power of skills is that there are thousands of skills available online because it's very easy to create skills. Most skills are actually just instructions, right?

### 💡 セクション 69

Sometimes or most of the times you don't need to bundle any scripts or additional assets with the skill. You just need to instruct the agent. If you want to change something in the database, you execute this command. If you need to delete a blog post, you execute this command, etc. And the power of this is that like whoever has the most understanding of that API or you know that set of actions can write the skill and then everybody can use it.

### 🔧 セクション 70

>> Yeah. Or your agent can write the skill like uh the only default skill that we ship agent zero with is a skill to create skills. So if you tell agent zero to create a skill for something it just did. >> Maybe can we show that? >> Yeah probably.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Uh okay. Did we do anything interesting now? Yeah, we did we did this with the with the the GitHub repo. So now use the skill creation skill to create a skill or doing this GitHub version scan. So anybody who has a software does releases updates and has it on GitHub could create a skill like this to save themselves a lot of time instead of writing updates manually.

### 💭 セクション 72

>> Yeah, especially if it's something open source where you have a lot of contributors and you have hundreds of you have hundreds of uh commits then you probably need to do this from time to time. Okay. >> So this skill uh default one it's pure instructions or what does it include? Yeah, it's pure instructions on how to create skills, where to put skills, what are the standards, how to format the skill to work properly. So, >> so before we had instruments, which was basically our own version, right?

### 📌 セクション 73

>> Yeah. Uh yeah, I I had this idea about I don't know 18 months ago something like that uh to create what we called instruments because with native tools and MCPS you are limited by the context window. All native tools and all MCP servers they have all the instructions persistently in the context window which can be very limiting if you have a lot of them. And so what I developed was the concept of instruments where these instructions they live in the memory database. They are not always present in the context window and they are loaded into the context window when they are relevant to the context of the conversation.

### ✅ セクション 74

So based on the vectorics yeah so when we talked about I don't know when we talked about machine learning or image generation it would load all the instruments from the vector database that were in some way relevant based on the similarity score to image generation. And just like skills, they had instruction files and they had optional executable scripts. So you can bundle tools into that. But then cloud skills released and the the repository of available cloud skill was growing. And since we were 90% similar or basically the same concept, we decided to migrate from from instruments to skills just to have the compatibility with cloud skills.

### 📚 セクション 75

Right? So now you can import and use any cloud skill or create cloud skill like this. So now in the user skill directory we now have GitHub version scan. It has the skill MD file. We can we can look into that.

### 🔖 セクション 76

So it has the proper skill header. It has the instructions for the agent what to do when to do it. Right? There's an example. what changed between ver version 097 and 098 and then the instruction use the script give it the tag names and it will output >> nice >> okay so these are cloud skills and like I said uh you can import you can import other skills for example I have some skills for WordPress that are that were recommended to do WordPress management >> so skills basically is the future of tools, right?

### 🎨 セクション 77

Because it comes with the instruction or don't you think so? >> Uh yeah, it's it's a future but it's not a replacement for native tools because uh there there is a gap between the native runtime the agent operates in and the runtime where the skill is being executed. Right? For example, agent zero framework, it runs in a Python process inside the Linux. And so in Python you have uh runtime variables variables and all this stuff that are bound to the Python process that's running agent zero.

>> But if agent zero executes something in a terminal it it's another terminal process right you from another terminal process you cannot for example change variables inside agent zero framework. So for some things for something like configuration of the agent if you want to change this at runtime using a skill you would need to change it somehow in a configuration file for example and then restart agent zero or something like that but it doesn't have direct realtime access to the runtime variables of the process >> external tools. >> Yeah for for external tools and uh the same way it's not a replacement for MCPS. MCPS are also specific in the way that MCPs have a persistent connection. They are always connected to the endpoint.

### ⚡ セクション 79

So they also run a bit differently. We will probably see a lot of MCPS migrate from MCPS to skills, especially those that don't require persistent connection to remote server and stuff like that. Definitely there is a lot of built-in tools in in various agents that can be migrated to skills, but definitely not everything. For example, the call subordinate tool that we have, right? If you want to call subordinate agent, you need to spawn the subordinate agent inside the Python process that's running the whole framework.

### 🌟 セクション 80

This could be done with a skill if we had some external interface like an API endpoint or something that would do it for us. But uh then it kind of breaks the purpose of having >> Okay. So I guess the UI is completely revamped. Anything specific you want to show now that we haven't touched on yet in the new UI? >> Uh in the new UI it's just worth mentioning that uh you can now see dramatically less information than before.

### 🎬 セクション 81

But uh that's not because the information wouldn't be there. We are just ma managing it in a more clever way. You can select from from various levels of detail >> like you can for example collapse all the steps that the agent is taking and see no detail at all. And you will see you will see the heading being updated. I can check system health again.

### 📋 セクション 82

And you will still see the heading being updated. You can still see the tool or or the type of step that's being executed but >> super compacted >> with all the steps. Or you can select to see the list of steps which will show you a collapsed list of all the steps or you can have it all expanded at all times. So this is where you see the most detail and the sweet spot in between is that the current step that is right now being executed let's say >> it's expanded and the rest get >> yeah it's expanded during the time the step is active and then it's being replaced by another step and it's being automatically collapsed. >> So this is like the classic agent zero vibe but a lot more cleaner UI.

### ⭐ セクション 83

Yeah, I like this because you can still see everything that's going on. You can still see all the code output. So if you have a sharp eye, you can immediately spot if something is off and every step has a full detail where you can see everything. For example, with the agent generation steps, this is where the LLM is generating tokens. You can see the reasoning if any, there's no reasoning here.

### 📝 セクション 84

uh you can see all the arguments and you can see the raw JSON content that the LLM produced. You can copy any of it. You can see it in raw JSON format. So all the information is still there, but it's it's cluttering the UI way less. >> Let's maybe touch on the long-term vision for Agent Zero, right?

### 💡 セクション 85

Where is the project headed? How do we want to build it? >> I think this changes over time, which is probably healthy. When when I started Agent Zero, it's it's almost two years now. It was something very new because back in the day we had frameworks like Crew AI or from the Microsoft the what was it?

### 🔧 セクション 86

Gen Gen Studio or something. >> Yeah. Origin Studio. And uh you really didn't have much to choose from when it came to doing something dynamic, right? For example, with Korea, you had to prepare your agents beforehand.

### 🎯 セクション 87

You had to put all the prompts like this is who you are. This is your role. You had to manually program all the tools and expose the tools to the agent. So, it was a powerful framework, but you had to do everything before you started using it. So, if you wanted to use it to organize your files or something, you had to prepare all the tools, meaning letting AI write the tools first in JGPT or something.

### 💭 セクション 88

copy paste it there. >> Most people are never going to do that. >> Yeah. Back then we didn't even have like VS Code plugins with AI or cursor and wind surf etc. And so my thought was like why don't we let the agent do what it wants right why don't we expose the terminal and let the agent execute tools on the fly without having the tools right in Linux you can install anything in Python you can install anything in Node.js you can install anything.

### 📌 セクション 89

So like these three Linux, Python and Node.js alone, this combined is the biggest repository of open source software in the world, right? You probably won't find anything that's that's not in one of these three, right? So why not let the agent execute its own code? So this was the original vision and this was something very novel back then, but not so much today, right? You have a lot of agents that can control the terminal.

### ✅ セクション 90

Agent zero still has the benefit that it's run. it in its own environment. It doesn't run in your environment. That's still the big difference. So, it's safe and it it can >> Yes.

### 📚 セクション 91

A lot of people are like freaking out like you know deploying cloud code, open code, open claw on their computer and then there's a big backlash that it's not secure, right? But agent zero like the architecture is fundamentally different because like you understood the dangers of having a powerful agent on your computer and that like all it even if it's 99% reliable all it takes is that one mistake where it deletes a important folder or whatever and it's not worth it. >> Yeah, of course. And so we do it the other way around. By default the agent is isolated and you choose what you want to share with the agent.

### 🔖 セクション 92

like you can drag and drop files or you can map folder into the docker and give it access to a single folder or you can give it access to some external service like your Google drive or something like that right so basically agent zero is like the only agent right now that's safe to run locally for other ones you need to either deploy them on a VPS or have them on a specific folder with you know approving every command agent zero like we didn't have to approve any terminal command or any tool call right it's >> yeah that's extremely annoying yeah >> you can be sure that agent zero will not touch your host machine like unless you share some folders from your host machine that you don't want to share with agent zero you can you can sleep well. >> Yeah. So that's a huge benefit. >> Okay. Uh we talked about the the vision and the direction.

### 🎨 セクション 93

Okay. So so back in the day this was the vision like having an agent that's completely dynamic and can do everything on the fly. Now we have a lot of agents that can do the same. We still have the complete package with sub aents and we have a ton of external connectivity like MCP A2A in both ways right you can communicate to agent zero as well as from agent zero using A2A and MCP and agent zero has its own API endpoint so you can it's really a full package it's very powerful but still it's uh it's not fundamentally different from from the other agents, right? It can be better in in a lot of ways, but now you have a lot of agents that can execute go.

### 🚀 セクション 94

So, our vision has shifted from shipping a personal assistant that will help you with your day-to-day tasks. By the way, it still can do that perfectly well, but we are now focusing on the I would call it the building potential, right? on extensibility, modularity and I would like agent zero to become the Linux of AI agents to be the platform that you can build upon and we already did several major updates in this direction. For example, the core of agent zero, we should probably see it in the file >> with the git projects. No, is that >> yeah G project as well.

### ⚡ セクション 95

But uh if we take a look at the core of agent zero for example, we have this extensibility system where most of the framework is placed into these folders in form of extensions, right? And these extensions are being called in various places inside the framework, when the agent starts responding, uh when the user sends a message, when a code is being executed, etc. And so if you want to build on top of agent zero, you don't need to change the code that's already in the in the core. Instead, you can simply add your files into these folders and they will start working right away. You don't even need to restart agent zero etc.

### 🌟 セクション 96

>> And agent zero can modify itself. So it can touch these folders >> just drop it in the chat, you know. >> Yeah, it comes with some risk, right? If it's modifying its own files on the fly, you always risk that it breaks something. So you might need to do a cleanup, but yeah, it can modify itself.

### 🎬 セクション 97

The the safest way is probably to let agents do edit edits. Yeah, backup of course, but edit subordinate agents >> because subordinate agents can also have any system extension. They can have their own tools. They can have their own config, their own prompts. So like if you want to try something new, you can probably tell agent zero to create a new subordinate agent, create new extensions for it, scripts, etc.

### 📋 セクション 98

Give it new skills and this way it can easily update itself. But yeah, of course, a lot of people are modding Agent Zero on the fly. >> And so the biggest one is yet to come, right? The plug-in system. >> Yeah, the plug-in system will be released in the next version.

### ⭐ セクション 99

And our goal is to move basically everything into plugins. So even the things that are currently inside the core of agents like uh the code execution tool, this will become a plug-in. So that if someone creates a better code execution tool, it can be replaced easily, right? You will just plug one out and plug the other in. And the same goes for the memory system, right?

### 📝 セクション 100

There there are so many options in terms of memory like graph databases, hybrid databases. There there's so much stuff so that now the community will be able to develop a better memory system than we have and users can replace the default one with the new one or even we can easily replace it without doing a modification to the core and releasing a full version of agent zero. This way people can update individual plugins without affecting the core or having to like deploy a new Docker container, reinstall everything. >> So making agent zero as modular as possible. >> Yes.

### 💡 セクション 101

and uh give the best control to the user so that you can clone others clone other projects or plugins and enable disable them config them independently on the core >> because there's a lot of people who like hyper specialized at agent zero and like created it the best possible for marketing or the best possible for research but right now it's only for them right so >> and unfortunately there are also people who like heavily modded something like seven versions back. >> I see. >> And now they have this heavily customized outdated version and if they wanted to update, they wouldn't need to solve a lot of conflicts in the core. >> But with a plug-in system, if you can develop everything as a plug-in, then you can update the core and your plugins will still work unless there is some fundamental shift somewhere. But that that's like 95% less chance of conflicts, right?

### 🔧 セクション 102

And another great thing for the modularity and isolation are projects. This is the most advanced project feature. We can I think we can make that claim pretty easily. It's the most advanced project feature out of any AI tool or agent. >> I I think so.

### 🎯 セクション 103

I I haven't checked every AI agent out there, but yeah, honestly, I have to say I haven't seen anything more advanced than this. Right. >> So, you can create I can select the color and if I want I can clone my project from a git repository. And this git repository can be completely unrelated to agent zero. Mhm.

### 💭 セクション 104

>> It can be something like a NodeJS project project that I want to work on and it will create the uh agent zero project just fine. It will clone everything from the remote repo or it can be an agent zero special project which means it can contain descriptions, instructions, instruction files. It can contain configuration. It can even contain knowledge files and memories. It can contain pre-built files in the repo and even secrets if someone wants to share his secrets on GitHub.

### 📌 セクション 105

But these these don't really need to be secret secrets, right? These can be like configuration variables. >> And uh you can pack it with specialized agents, with skills, with tools, extensions, configurations, basically everything. And the project has its own project structure where everything agent zero related is in agent zero project folder. So this can be pre-built by the creator of the project and you can clone it.

### ✅ セクション 106

The big benefit of projects is that once you create a project and you can activate it, it's it's activated per chat. So next to the chat you can see the color of the project that you have activated. And now the agent is instructed that you are now working inside of this project. This is the working directory of the project, you will create all of the files inside this project. You will not leave any garbage outside of this folder.

### 📚 セクション 107

Also, whenever the agent spawns a new terminal, it is automatically spawned in the working directory of the project, right? And in the project, like I said, you can have specialized instructions or instruction files. So on my daily driver agent zero instance I have many projects to help me with organizing the agent zero project uh managing my accounting creating development tickets for developers and a lot of other stuff. So I have instructions there scripts uh I have project for doing simulations. So there are a lot of scripts for running simulations and the agent is instructed to write inputs.

### 🔖 セクション 108

We are now developing a benchmarking project for example. So there will be a publicly available benchmark project for agent zero that you can download and when a new LLM comes out it can run it can run a set of benchmarks with that new LLM and assign scores and these would be real world use cases like download stock prices and uh I don't know create a table of correlation between bitcoin prices and stock prices or something like that something where we can easily and exactly verify the results And we can measure the speed and number of steps and number of tokens etc. So this is then perfect for people who want to share their complete projects including agents tools and everything and with plugins it will be even one step further. >> Yeah. So agent zero is becoming more ready to be deployed into companies into your complex environments sharable like if somebody spends hundreds of hours creating projects, improving their agency configuration.

### 🎨 セクション 109

Soon enough, it will be very easy to deploy that across the whole team. >> Yeah, that that's where we are headed. We really want to be a platform. We want to be maintaining the core. The core has to be super stable and efficient of course, but then everything else should be in form of plugins because this will simplify the development for companies so much, right?

### 🚀 セクション 110

Like if you have a set of I don't know 60 or 200 plugins, you just need to have a list of them and you will deploy new agent zero instance, you will have an installation script or something. It will simply plug in these 200 plugins with configuration files and you have something completely different to the default agent zero experience or to a different agent zero instance you would use for something else. But still you get the benefit that you can easily deploy, you can easily update the core. It's it's independent of one another. >> Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 111

>> Cool. Anything else you want to touch on that we haven't touched on yet? >> Yeah, we we haven't shown the secrets management. I can actually copy my my open router API key here because I wanted to show a cool feature. Okay.

### 🌟 セクション 112

Where are we? Settings. secrets management. And this is one of the cool features of Agent Zero. You can put secrets in here like uh open brower API key.

### 🎬 セクション 113

Okay, I will revoke this key of course, but the goal is that I will save this and agent zero or the LLM running inside agent zero will never see this value. Most people are leaking their stuff to LLMs, right? And they have no idea where they're being sent. >> Yeah. And like uh you don't even have to do it manually on purpose.

### 📋 セクション 114

Sometimes the agent will simply open a file that contains a secret and read it >> or it will simply I don't know output it in Python. So it will print variables or something and now all of your API keys are leaked. Uh the way it works in agent zero is both ways. uh when the agent wants to use this it will use a spe special placeholder containing this key and at runtime during the tool execution whether it's a code execution or calling some of the native tools or MCPS or whatever during the last runtime step it will be replaced with the raw value without the agent seeing it and it works the other way around as well so whenever any of the secrets would appear in plain it would be masked back to the key. So even if the agent opens uh the file containing these secrets or if it prints it in Python and sees it in the terminal output, it will be replaced with the placeholder back.

### ⭐ セクション 115

So so these are the two guards we have not to expose. >> So basically it can use these keys to do curl commands or you know tools API calls without you leaking the stuff. >> Yeah. Without ever seeing it. >> Yeah.

### 📝 セクション 116

sending it to enthropic or opening >> even even if it accidentally prints it or something it will still not be able to see it because we have the second guard rail that prevents it. This is very important for again companies, you know, businesses, people who have serious projects because like if it leaks your open our API key with $20 limit, it's probably not a big deal. But if it leaks, you know, your company database root password, then it could be an issue >> like like if it's an if it's an enterprise use case, you should probably still have some completely external service for managing your keys and passwords, right? so that the the agent never touches them directly. But this is the best you can get uh inside of a single box.

### 💡 セクション 117

Okay. And so now the agent now has the open router API key. So I can tell it uh uh you now have open router API key tested on open router with some random model. Right? And this is how the agent uses these secrets.

### 🔧 セクション 118

Right? It has a it has a special syntax and it will be replaced on the fly. Okay. So we have a list of models from open router including pricing. So it's it's probably concerned about spending too much.

### 🎯 セクション 119

Okay. API call was successful. Okay. What did we try? Step one step three 3.5 flesh.

### 💭 セクション 120

I've never I've never heard about this model. >> Oh it's free. It's free. That's probably why the model choose it for the test. Nice.

### 📌 セクション 121

>> Okay. But it works. So I can tell it like uh now use nano banana. Let's use the faster one. That's a 2.5 flash.

### ✅ セクション 122

Uh and generate an image of an I don't know Luna. So it should be able to find nano banana on open router. on open router it's actually not called nano banana it's called something like >> Gemini 2.5 >> Gemini flesh image or something like that >> so again instead of because it has the context and because it has the API key you didn't even have to specify to not use Google studio right it knows to use open already >> yeah yeah yeah okay it found it Gemini 2.5 flesh image so it's calling it now in the terminal >> and this is what you like it's now figuring out how to extract the image right so this is what you mentioned like intelligent in these servers or services >> where like sometimes you know file attachment is missing or might be a different format and if if you haven't handled that as a developer then you'll get an error but if there's a agent it can just figure out okay I should expect a file but it only returns text let me investigate >> yeah that's the beauty of LLM that it's so versatile like for example uh we have a tool inside agent zero to analyze images like if you give it an image it will analyze as an image and output the raw image data for the LLM to actually see what's inside the image. But it doesn't support PDFs by default. And if you accidentally give it a PDF, it will try to use that tool.

### 📚 セクション 123

The tool will will error out and agent zero will say something like, "Oh, okay. I need to have an image. So let's use a Linux terminal tool to convert PDFs to images and then try again." Right? And like you said, you don't need to handle this as a programmer. Now that we have agent zero connected to open router with the capability of generating images, I can now try what I did in the morning.

### 🔖 セクション 124

Now create a new page in our WordPress. Make a form for image generation using this exact process you just did. Uh, one field or prompt, one button, output image, download button. Okay. And let's see.

### 🎨 セクション 125

It should hopefully be able to recreate the scenario again where it creates a new plug-in inside the WordPress. This plug-in will have a front end form just like this with the input button to generate image and the image output. Yeah, this one is actually using the pro so it might take a while to generate that image. And here you can see agent zero called a subordinate with the profile developer which has some basic instructions specialized at development. Y and now agent one is creating API endpoint PHP file.

### 🚀 セクション 126

Okay, I don't know how how long this is going to take. So we can talk more about agent zero and let this finish. >> Maybe people ask like difference versus open claw, right? We already touched on some of these but what are some other things we have already mentioned? I actually also used perplexity to ask perplexity about the difference between between uh open claw and agent zero and the other agents and uh I I think it kind of nailed the main difference that uh open claw seems to be more focused on the end user >> the consumer >> the the consumer yeah so it comes with the like pre-built uh pre-built connectors and pre-built skills to do the most common jobs people might want to do with it out of the box.

### ⚡ セクション 127

Uh whereas we don't have anything pre-built into agent zero. Every single tool that's pre-built in agent zero is just to serve the framework functionality and everything else is to be developed by the agent. So we ship we ship a toolbox, right? We we don't ship a solution to your problem. >> It's a platform.

### 🌟 セクション 128

We we ship an agent that will find the solution to your problem. >> Yeah. More like like you said like the Linux or AI agents. >> That's the that's the ultimate goal. So I think the difference is uh in the focus or in the audience we are targeting.

### 🎬 セクション 129

>> It's the same with the operating systems like most consumers use Mac OS, Windows almost nobody like percentage wise uses Linux right. It's like maybe one or two percent. >> Yeah. >> But every single server runs Linux. >> Yeah of course.

### 📋 セクション 130

So basically agent zero is more extensible, more customizable, more secure, more privacy oriented. So it's going to naturally appeal to companies, you know, B2B, governments, you know, serious individuals, power users rather than the consumers. >> Yeah, true. I would still like to keep agent zero being user friendly and able to handle your day-to-day stuff because I use my daily driver every day and I do a ton of stuff with it like uh all the stuff that I for example on our website right converting formats, resolutions, optimizing everything. We did some heavy optimizations uh to pass SEO rankings and if you have like 60 images on the website and you need to create a macro in Photoshop or something, all these things take a lot of time.

### ⭐ セクション 131

>> Yeah. >> So, it's way easier to just like take 50 images, drag and drop them into the agent zero chat and tell it like I need these five resolutions. I need them all to be under one kilobyte or something like that. and uh and you just get it. Okay, it's finished doing something.

### 📝 セクション 132

Okay, AI image generator. We have two links here. They seem to be okay. I have two versions of AI image generator. H interesting.

### 💡 セクション 133

So, let's see. Oh, this is nice. >> Yeah, >> I didn't ask for this, but okay. Oh, no image data found in the API response. Okay, let's try again.

### 🔧 セクション 134

And let's also try the other one. Maybe there's a difference. >> Might be the same issue that it solved previously in chat. Not expecting the open router format. >> Okay, I can give this to a zero.

### 🎯 セクション 135

I don't need to fix this. So, yeah, it looks nicer, but it this time it didn't work out of the box, unfortunately. Right. But I I think this illustrates the potential of AI agents in in the realm of IT services, right? Probably not directly like this where a service is running inside of an agent.

### 💭 セクション 136

This comes with a lot of additional challenges like if you want to update the agent but there is a service running inside like how do you do it safely etc. >> Yeah. But probably we will see basically any service in the future running side by side or being inspected by some agent from above, right? Because why why would you run a server without without any AI inspection if it can spot 247 any irregularities any problems and uh also with the WordPress I can for example tell it to write a new blog post about version 098 in the word press. use your readme file to get the information, right?

### 📌 セクション 137

And it will update the blog post for me on the website. So I can schedule a new task. I can tell the agent to schedule a task, for example, to check the news every morning and write a blog post about it, right? and I can read the news on my blog >> or >> or maybe for a new AI model like if there's anticipation check official >> anything interesting in the AI space or if we release a new agent zero version it can again clone the repository check the changes and do a new post with the change log right so I would probably I will probably create one VPS for agent zero that would be persistent and that would be agent zero's personal blog because I really like the idea Now that agent zero would be checking our development efforts and would be blogging about it. >> Yeah, that would be really cool.

### ✅ セクション 138

I think I think this is the future deploying a agents on different VPS and letting them run. >> Okay, it seems we have a new blog post. Okay, where are we? Home. Yeah, >> there is it.

### 📚 セクション 139

Yeah, >> very nice. Right. And I don't need to tell agent zero to do this. I can tell agent zero uh schedule a task that will run every day and check if there is anything new in our repository and if there is something new >> and you set it up once and like you'll have a block new blocks coming out forever for all future updates. >> Yeah, good for SEO.

### 🔖 セクション 140

>> Yeah, really cool. >> Yeah. Okay. Uh, the other agent finished fixing this. So, so let's see.

### 🎨 セクション 141

Big cut on fence and let's see. I'll give it one more chance. Nice. All right. So, we're going to link the Agent Zero YouTube channel.

### 🚀 セクション 142

We have a bunch of more specialized and detailed videos there going more deeper into the settings because agent zero is very powerful and yeah we need to bridge the delta between the power users and the new users right because there's people who have like crazy setups >> who spend you know 50 100 200 hours on this >> and people looking from outside don't really see the potential of agent zero >> I think I think we can really help even even new users completely completely untouched by agent zero with the on boarding into agent zero with the plugins because we can create something like sets of plugins and we can have a set of I don't know 10 15 20 basic plugins for new users that will have the most popular tools built in like for example the image generation and perplexity search and all all the stuff that that a common guy would need and then we can have specialized pre-built sets of plugins for system administration penetration testing, right? Marketing, you name it. >> And >> that's going to become really powerful spreading. >> And these cost us basically nothing because we will just maintain a list of recommended plugins for the scenario or for the use case. >> Yeah.

### ⚡ セクション 143

And if something is like super requested or super popular, we can add it. >> Sure. The community can add it. >> So yeah, if people want to contribute, we're going to link the GitHub repo as well. And uh anything else?

### 🌟 セクション 144

>> I think we're good. Thank you very much and stay safe in gentic times. >> All right. Thank everybody for watching and I wish you a wonderful productive week. See you guys.
