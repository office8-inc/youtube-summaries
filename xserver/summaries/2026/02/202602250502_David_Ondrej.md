## 💡 概要

この動画では、Googleが新たにリリースしたGemini 3.1 ProをAntigravity（次世代AIコーディングIDE）で使い、地政学的リスクダッシュボードを構築するデモを紹介しています。Gemini 3.1 ProはARC-AGI 2で77%・GPQA Diamondで94%という高スコアを記録し、特にフロントエンドデザイン・SVGアニメーション・視覚的なUI生成において他モデルを大きく凌駕しています。Antigravity上のマルチエージェント管理機能を活用することで、コーディング経験がなくても自然言語だけで本格的なフルスタックアプリを構築できることを実証しています。AI開発ツールや最新モデル比較に関心のある開発者・起業家向けの動画です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **Gemini 3.1 ProはARC-AGI 2で77%を達成**：抽象推論ベンチマークでOpus 4.6やGPT-5.2を大幅に上回り、科学的知識テスト（GPQA Diamond）でも94%を記録する総合的に高性能なモデル
- **AntigravityのAIエージェントマネージャーが強力**：複数のAIエージェントを並行稼働させ、コードの自律実行・ブラウザ操作・デバッグ・テストまでをエージェントが自動で担う次世代IDE
- **Gemini 3.1 ProはAntigravity専用に最適化**：OpenClawなど他ツールで使うと不安定だが、Antigravity内ではGoogle製品同士の最適化により非常に高いパフォーマンスを発揮する
- **フロントエンド・デザインではGemini 3.1 Proが最強**：デザインアリーナ（SVGデザイン部門）で圧倒的1位を獲得。ランディングページやアニメーション生成で他モデルを大きくリードする
- **誰でも自然言語でアプリが作れる時代**：コーディング知識ゼロでも英語（または日本語）で指示するだけで、3DグローブとリアルタイムAPIを組み合わせたような複雑なアプリを構築できる

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Guys, Gemini 3.1 Pro might be the best AI model in the world. Look at this. This black hole simulation was built inside of anti-gravity with Gemini 3.1 Pro. And that's only scratching the surface. Look at these landing pages that Gemini created.

### 📋 背景・概要

If you told somebody this is AI generated just 6 months ago, they would not believe you. But today, this is possible thanks to Gemini 3. Pro. So, in case you don't know, Google just released Gemini 3.0 Pro and it might be the best AI model in the world. And the best part is you can use it for free inside of anti-gravity.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

This is Google's AI coding cool kind of their competitor to cursor or close code. Now, apart from these incredible builds that I just showed you, why is Gemini 3.1 such a big deal? Well, let's take a look at the benchmarks. First off, Arc AGI 2, which is abstract reasoning puzzles that AI models notoriously struggle with. Look at this.

### 📝 詳細説明

Gemini 3.1 Pro scores at 77% which is even far ahead of Opus and GBT 5.2. Next up, GPQA Diamond. This is very hard questions. scientific knowledge 94% again well ahead of Opus and GBD 5.2 and the third benchmark where Gemini 3.1 really stands out is browse comp this is Agentic Search 85% a little bit ahead of Opus and a very ahead of GBD 5.2 too. So, overall, this is a very well-rounded model, especially when it comes to difficult questions, math, science, and all that stuff.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So, here's the plan. First, I'll show you how to actually set up anti-gravity. Then, we'll use Gemini 3.0 Pro to build a powerful AI agent inside of anti-gravity. And I'll show you how to do this just by typing in plain English. And no, you don't have to be a developer to follow along.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

And at the end, we'll compare Gemini 3.1 Pro to other cuttingedge AI models such as Opus 4.6 6 and GBD 5.3 CEX to see whether it really is the best AI model in the world. So there's a lot to cover, so make sure to watch until the end. The first thing we have to do is install anti-gravity. So just type it into Google and click on the very first link, Google Anti-Gravity. And this is a very powerful AI tool, and it's specifically built for coding, but not just that, it's advanced management of multiplayer agents to code apps.

### 🎯 応用例

In other words, it's the next generation IDE. So click on the download button, download for Mac OS. Select your operating system right here. Once it's installed, double click on the installer and drag it into your applications folder. There we go.

### 💭 考察

Now, let's type in anti-gravity. Oh, there it is. Okay. So, you can choose whether to import stuff from other IDEs. Maybe you use cursor VS code.

### 📌 まとめ

I'm going to actually use cursor. We have different forms. Obviously, the only theme that's correct is dark theme. Now, this is interesting, right? How do we want to use anti-gravity agent?

### ✅ 結論

We have the strict mode where you have to approve everything. Reviewd driven development is recommended or agent-driven development, which uh is the most aggressive one and which is the one I'm going to select. Let's go next. Key bindings blah blah blah. Okay, next.

### 📚 追加情報

We can approve that. And then the last thing is authenticate with Google. This is what gives us free access to Gemini 3.0 Pro. Now, if you have any Google products, right, such as the Google AI plus or Google AI Pro or Google AI Ultra, then you obviously get a lot more usage and the models will be faster because on the free limit, they're kind of slow. So, if you have this, obviously use the account where you have the paid Google AI plan.

### 🔖 補足

If not, don't worry, just use any Google account. We need to sign in here and then we get redirected back into Gravity setting up. Accept the terms of use and next. And as you can see on the left, we have Gemini 3.0 Pro already selected inside of the chat with high reasoning effort on. Amazing.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Now, when you first open Gravity, you need to obviously open some projects. Boom. Gemini 3.0 Pro. And I'm going to create a folder named project starting completely from scratch. There we go.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Yes, I trust the offers of this folder cuz literally me and let me zoom in a bit. So, as usual IDE, you have a files. I mean, you might have this on the left, right? You might have the files on the left, but you just have the chat the middle where you can see the code and then the explorer with the files. However, there's a big big button, open agent manager at the top.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And this opens up a brand new window. But this is the main unique thing about Ed Gravity is the AI agent manager where you can easily manage and orchestrate multiple different AI agents working on the same project. And this is really the biggest difference compared to Cursor or Windsor or any other IDE. It is anti-gravity's agent manager. And again, you can easily switch back between the editor or the Asia manager.

### 🌟 セクション 16

It's up to you. Now, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create right click, new file, idea.md. It's going to be a new idea. And here, I'm just going to paste in a concise description of the thing I want to build. And basically, this is a 3D globe showcasing a live geopolitical risk dashboard.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And in fact, I'm going to show you how powerful Geograph 1 Pro is. We're going to try to do this in two prompts. First, in the planning mode, and then execute, right? I'm going say read idea.md and create a concise step-by-step plan how to build this full stack web app. Boom.

### 📋 セクション 18

Plain English. Nothing fancy. I'm just going to let it run. In the meantime, let me read the idea to you. Live geopolitical risk dashboard.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Full stack web app with a 3D rotating globe powered by firecrol API scripts, breaking news, all prices, flight rider blocks, and defense stock tickers in real time. So, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty in the world. Stuff like this is basically your own version of Palanteer software, right? that you can monitor the situation in a professional 3D web app. So, one screen showing a global thread map with colorcoded risk levels that auto update.

### 📝 セクション 20

All right, Gemini is already finished. Pretty good. Pretty good. So, I'm going to switch from planning to fast. I'll say good.

### 💡 セクション 21

Now, get to work and build the whole thing end to end. Do not stop until it's finished. Boom. Let's see if Gemini 3.1 Pro is capable of this because it has a reputation for oneshoting a very ambitious builds and this is definitely not an easy app to create. In the meantime, let me explain what firecrol is because as you can see, our app is going to be powered by firecrol API.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Now, firecrol is an open source API built for AI agents. So, it easily lets them scrape websites, crawl websites, and it gives the output in a nice markdown format or a clear structured JSON. So, let's see how antig is doing. All right, it's going. It's not stuck on anything.

### 🎯 セクション 23

We already have a full folder structure on the right. Not bad at all. Okay, let's see how many minutes it takes. In the meantime, let's create a firecroll account. So, again, go to firecrol.dev dev and top right click on sign up and you can get started completely for free.

### 💭 セクション 24

So just use whatever signup method you want to use. And here during the onboarding you can claim a bunch of free points by following them on GitHub such as starting their repo or discord. Actually let's do that. I think I already started. Yeah, I already did that.

### 📌 セクション 25

Amazing. So you can just get free points to have even more scraping with AI. All right. So let's select YouTube. Scroll to bottom.

### ✅ セクション 26

Agree. Continue. And now it gives us readym made code that we can integrate. Right. So what?

### 📚 セクション 27

Let's see what we're using here. Okay. It wants to create a file env. So this is the only time it wanted to request because it's an environment file. So I'm going to allow in this conversation.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Let's click allow. And then I'm going to copy the Do we have any Python? It's all node. I'm going to copy the node API. And it already presets that your API key by the way, which obviously keep them private.

### 🎨 セクション 29

I'm going to revoke mine before uploading this video. But I'm going to copy this. I'm going to say here is the official fire crawl docs. Use it. And we're just going to paste the snippet that firecrol gave us.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Resume where you left off. Boom. interrupt and send it. Let's click on continue here. Select whether your team or personal and continue.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And again, Firecrol has very generous free plan with 500 pages scraped for AI agents. However, if you want another 1,000 free credits, go to the left, click on settings, go to billing right here. Click on billing, and you can see apply coupon, and just type in code David and click apply. And boom. Just like that, it gives you another 1,000 credits.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So then if we go to the left and click on usage, we should see that we have 1,625 credits. Amazing. So this will let us run fire crawl for quite a bit. And yeah, as I said, the free plan is already very generous. So if you want to build powerful AI agents that can crawl the web, scrape websites, get you a bunch of valuable data, make sure to use firecroll.

### 🎬 セクション 33

You can get started completely for free. Just go to firecrol.dev and create an account. And make sure to use the code David for additional 1,000 free credits. Oh yeah, and thank you Firecrol for sponsoring this video. So Gemini 3.1 Pro is still building.

### 📋 セクション 34

Yeah, this is a very ambitious project. That's crazy. Okay, so in the meantime, we can go to agent manager and we can dispatch another agent. So on the left, I'm going to click on project because that's our folder and we can start a new conversation. I'm going to say read idea MD and tell me what still needs to be built.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Answer in short, we have to figure out what is missing because this agent has been running for a while, right? Wait a second. A lot of is happening. So this AI agent responded, but this one is still cooking. And look at this.

### 📝 セクション 36

It's testing by itself. Where is it? It opened the browser by itself. Okay, this is not finished. It's controlling itself.

### 💡 セクション 37

I'm not doing anything. It's getting domed. Look at this. This is why people love anti-gravity. It really gives the AI agents power to not only build the software themselves, but also debug it, test it, and analyze it.

### 🔧 セクション 38

When you see this blue outline over here, it means that it's using the browser by itself. I'm not doing anything. It's controlling it by itself. Let's switch back to integrated to see the reasoning. Server is running running.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Let me open the browser. Verify the app. Navigate to local host. Wait for the page to load. Geopolitical risk monitor.

### 💭 セクション 40

Okay. Now it's uh assessing something. Okay. Okay. Let's see if it improves it.

### 📌 セクション 41

So we have the we have the live Intel feed. All prices on the right. This is good. The right side looks good. The earth looks pretty bad to be honest.

### ✅ セクション 42

Top right. We can refresh the intel. All right. So I'm going to give it some input. I'll say the 3D Earth looks bad.

### 📚 セクション 43

Make it look like Google Earth. You can do a lot better. Okay, I'm going to pause it and get it refocused on this. Let's see if it actually improves it. Let's go back.

### 🔖 セクション 44

Google Chrome. This is the default. Uh, black sphere obviously doesn't look nowhere near as good as it could. Implementing texture mapping. Downloading textures locally.

### 🎨 セクション 45

Damn. He's doing curl commands to download some textures. This is very autonomous, guys. I'm impressed with like Gemini 3.0 Pro. I've tested it inside of Open Code and it was all right.

### 🚀 セクション 46

You know, you really need to use it inside of anti-gravity to squeeze the full potential out of it because Google has made it for anti-gravity and they are serious about competing with cursor. This is not just a toy anymore. When anti-gravity first launched, it was kind of buggy. It wasn't all quite there. But man, this is even though we're fixing the, you know, earth, this is still very nice.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Look, very nice dashboard. We have the news feed on the right. 26 active events, oil prices, defense stocks, flight alerts. Low key, I might even use it because I'm in Dubai, which is pretty close to Iran and a lot of stuff is happening in the straight of Hormuz. So, you know, I'm not quite on the front lines, but almost.

### 🌟 セクション 48

I might actually use this dashboard to check it daily. Okay, let's see what's happening. So, it's downloading some files, some textures, and now it's implementing visual enhancements. And again, guys, I literally said a few problems. Like the era of building apps is here.

### 🎬 セクション 49

Anybody can do this. You don't have to have any developer background. As long as you can use the computer and speak in English, you can build apps that you want. It's all about execution. If you have a good idea and if you have work ethic, there we go.

### 📋 セクション 50

It's updating. It was there. Now, it crashed. Oh my god, it was there. I've seen it for a split second.

### ⭐ セクション 51

I'm so excited for this earth. All you need is an idea and the willingness to actually build it. If you're willing to sit down and figure this out, man, you really can't build anything. All right, so I want my 3D globe powered by fire crawl to work. I can just take a screenshot say like now I see white screen instead of the globe.

### 📝 セクション 52

Fix this. Maybe I was trying to fix it. I didn't need to probably interrupt it. Let me reload actually. Oh, there it is.

### 💡 セクション 53

Wow, this is much better. Is it accurate? Go around. There's this dark I don't like this shade, though. This dark tint.

### 🔧 セクション 54

Oh, okay. So, it's the light is kind of regional. Okay, Mexico. Something's happening. Venezuela.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Yeah. But main thing is here in Iran, risk level high. And then Ukraine, obviously. So, this is much better, but I'm going to be more specific. make the earth less black.

### 💭 セクション 56

There's some weird tint. Maybe that's the textures that came with. I don't know. Yeah, I mean Gemini 3.0 Pro definitely isn't lazy. It does a lot more reasoning than Opus, but I don't know if more than GBD 5.3 CX because GBD 5.3 CX is known to run for hours if you needed to.

### 📌 セクション 57

So, I would say this is probably somewhere in between. But again, so far my experience with Gemini 3.0 Pro has been the best inside of anti-gravity. I would not recommend you use it outside of anti-gravity because it's much worse in other tools and in Open Claw. It was crashing a lot. In fact, let me show you some my tweets because I want to be as uh accurate as possible.

### ✅ セクション 58

So, here's what happened. I put it into Make sure to follow me on Twitter, David OJ1. I put it into Open Claw to test it out, right? Gemini 3.1 Pro and uh it started answering and then it had some like issue with WhatsApp but as you can see this is response on WhatsApp and it just went insane. It couldn't stop the conversation.

### 📚 セクション 59

In fact, it it went completely crazy. It sent like 10 messages like this. I had to scroll up for minutes to find this and close tag. I'm follow by and close tag. So yeah, inside of OpenClaw I would stick to either Sonet 4.6 or Opus 4.6 Because Gemini 3.1 like I don't know Google needs to improve their API because when you use it outside of Google products it's nowhere near as good like inside of anti-gravity it's amazing but inside of open claw no way like stick to using solid models opus models or you know GBD 5.3 codex or maybe even like miniax and stuff okay we have some changes but still nothing nothing crazy keeps analyzing it and again here we can comment on files so each of them like as artifact So we can do specific comments if you want to go through the code.

### 🔖 セクション 60

All of that is still available inside of anti gravity or you can go completely off hand and just chill in the agent manager and never look at code ever. It's up to you like anti-gravity gives you all the options. But yeah to finish my thoughts for general agent use. I think Opus 4.6 is still the best model for deep coding like very tough technical issues. I would say GPD 5.3 codex is the best model.

### 🎨 セクション 61

But for like front end design, landing pages, you know, one showing impressive apps, I think uh Gemini 3.1 Pro might be the best. Also on SVGs, let me show you this. This is crazy. So Gemini 3.1 Pro landed number one on design arena or SVG designs by a lot. Like look how far ahead it is.

### 🚀 セクション 62

And the previous number one was Gemini 3, but 3.1 is very much ahead. So anything like front end design related, anything design related, definitely use Gemini 3.1. Let me show you a clear example here. This is a simple animation. Generate an SVG animation of two minimal isometric like there's multiple animations here, but the first one is a clear demonstration of the attention of detail of Gemini 3.1 Pro.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Boom. Here's a simple toggle plant growing. Beautiful order. Oh, this is a big difference. Look at this chameleon.

### 🌟 セクション 64

Wow. Yeah, Gemini 3. Pro is a huge step up in design. And I think this shines thanks to the multimodel data that Google has. If you think about it, how good an AI model is.

### 🎬 セクション 65

Okay, now we got some improvement of the texture. Pretty cool. How good an AI model is depends entirely, well, not entirely, but heavily on the training data. And Google has so much data. They have YouTube, they have Google, they have so many different services, Android, so many different services that gives them high quality multimodal data.

### 📋 セクション 66

And that's why Gemini 3.0 Pro is so good at these visuals and graphics and videos and animations and it's finished. It's really this isn't a lazy model. It keeps running until it works. So, I'm going to give it good because um yeah, this is a very nice geo geopolitical risk dashboard. Can refresh the intel.

### ⭐ セクション 67

26 active threats. What's happening here? Oh, in Congo. Nobody's visiting Congo. That's fine.

### 📝 セクション 68

But yeah, the Iran is 64 out of 100 higher than Ukraine threat. Wow. We have our own mini version of Palanteer. So we can monitor the situation with Gemini 3.0 Pro powered by Firecrol API. So again, if you want a super powerful web scraper and webcwler that's built for AI agents first, make sure to use Firecrol and also use the code David for 1,000 free credits.

### 💡 セクション 69

Just go to firecrol.dev, create an account. Super easy, takes 20 seconds. And anytime your AI agent needs to access a website, instead of getting a messy HTML and DOM, he just receives a very nice JSON or markdown, whichever you prefer. And if you're running an AI business and want to work with me directly to scale faster, make sure to apply to my accelerator. The link is going to be below the video as well.

### 🔧 セクション 70

With that being said, thank you guys for watching and I wish you a wonderful, productive week. See you.
