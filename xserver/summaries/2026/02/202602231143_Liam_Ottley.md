## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

All right, guys. So, you might have seen my recent video on me saying AGI is here. And my next steps after that is is sharing with you my plan on how I plan to implement this AGI into my business to automate 60 to 70% of the tasks that I currently do. And this video is going to be breaking down uh my kind of approach to it, what this model is, and and the methodology that I've come up with, and hopefully give you guys a bit of a pointer in the direction of how you can start with yours. Um, I'm going to be making a ton more content around how to actually get this set up.

### 📋 背景・概要

This is just a highle snapshot of what I'm doing with our businesses. I' I've been running AI businesses for the past three years now. I've got my content business which essentially runs it south cuz it's got sponsorships and stuff like that. So we treat that as a business. Um Morningside AI, my AI development and consulting agency or AI transformation partner as we call it now.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Morningside education where I do my info stuff through my school community and also my accelerator program. And then Morningside Ventures where we have our SAS arm and investment arm as well. So, we've got a a product in there and we've got another one in partnership. So, been running AI businesses for ages. And this stuff that I'm about to talk about, this AIOS, AI operating system that I'm about to share with you is the biggest thing, the most exciting thing that I've seen since Chief D came out at the end of 2022.

### 📝 詳細説明

Right? This I have the same feeling, maybe even more excited than how I felt like back then with the stuff I'm about to share with you. Because if you're a business owner or you're aspiring to become a business owner, this is the future of business. This is all you need to be thinking about right now. Please, business owners, drop [ __ ] everything and listen to this stuff.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Subscribe cuz I'm going to be like ramming the stuff down your throat for a while now because I will not stop talking about it. And when you see this sort of systems that I've set up here and what it can do for your business, you'll be totally on board as well. For those of you who are not familiar with any of the stuff I'm talking about and like, what the hell is this dude talking about? Uh, there's been a a big shift in AI capabilities and the ability to essentially you can automate anything now. And I do not say that lightly.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I've always had a healthy skepticism toward uh vibe coding and and building and things like that. But this is different and it's different because I've seen it. And the things I'm going to talk about on here have proven to me that there is now this if you can dream it, you can do it. And you don't necessarily need to even be that technical. So if you're a business owner thinking you need to have a whole team of devs to achieve some of the stuff I'm going to talk about, that's not true.

### 🎯 応用例

And it's all centered around claude code. And I know clawed code might sound like a dev tool, which it originally was, but it is so so much more than that. And all of the stuff that I built here is essentially putting layers and layers around a claude code setup that allows you to run your business from it. In my case, I'm running it from Telegram. Uh it's here on my phone.

### 💭 考察

So, if I'm out at the beach, I'm actually going to film a a vlog if you guys want to watch kind of behind the scenes of of me and all my friends. We're here. I was supposed to have left here already, but we're going to stay here because we're so locked in on this. Hence the generational port code lock in. And we are just absolutely nerding out on this trying to automate as much of our business as possible.

### 📌 まとめ

And so I haven't got much space but I'll try to explain what code is and how it applies to this. But you essentially have the model and the model is like GPT5 or you have uh anthropic opus 4.6 and then you have what's called a harness. I don't really know how people would visualize that but here's a harness around the model. Oh, that was pretty good. And what claw code is that built all these like tools that allow the model to do things in a much uh more powerful and fluid way.

### ✅ 結論

So these are like connectors to all sorts of different services. It can read files, delete files. And while this was originally intended as a development tool, you can connect all of this into a more general purpose business workspace um that does all of these things. So long story short, I have created a folder on my Mac. I have opened it in a coding environment.

### 📚 追加情報

And I know that might sound scary, but I will be explaining in my next couple of videos on how to set these up. Uh it's really not that difficult. I've seen people right in front of me do it as a completely non-technical person, but you set up a couple of folders, you add in context about you and your business, and then you're able to start adding layers and layers and layers on top of that. Fame for context. I'm going to be aiming to if I go up here tick as many of these off as I can over the next few weeks uh so that I can get some kind of percentage 60 70% of my business will be automated with AI or at least the tasks that I currently do and there's of course there's many different things I could roll in.

### 🔖 補足

I was like there's there's always like a million projects or things that you want to do with the business but I'm just going to focus on the things that I'm currently doing that I can get off my plate or heavily augment or delegate to uh to this AI system. So the idea would be to get to 60 to 70% 70% uh automation. And so we have like zero out of however many this is. I need to count them up. But this is essentially my plan.

### 🎨 セクション 13

I've gone through each of my businesses and I've written out what are the things that I'm doing in the case of content. I'm responsible for all of this. It's like really what I am responsible for the results for. Um then I have a business partner who's really responsible for the results here. Uh we have forest education and ventures and these are the things that I do within each of those.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Business OS, however, is a little bit different in that these are the layers and layers and layers of AI that I've built up over the business. There's a bunch more that I'd like to do. These are the ones I currently have. But the way that you can think about uh what this AIOS model is is essentially a a business methodology or approach to business uh not a business model itself. So if you think of a a business model, call this the model.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Uh for people watching my channel, it might be like an AI automation agency uh or an AI transformation partner, which are AI business models, which I've been pushing for years now because we've run it at Morningside and we've seen like me getting into that business model was the gateway to me learning all of this stuff, building multiple businesses. It's like the best on-ramp into AI for anyone who is uh even nontechnical or you're a developer or anyone who wants to get into AI doesn't have a boatload of money and can't afford to build a build the traditional startup route. This is the entry point that many people have been getting in through. So say you have a biz model and then around it you have your AIOS AI operating system and so this is a separate part on how you choose to operate uh and a sort of a methodology towards operating and uh automating your business. So when you start off with say context OS which is just getting the right folder structure set up uh adding the right documents in determining how you're going to document the workspace as it grows uh priming each clawed code session that is the base layer and you could treat that as okay I'm going to put one layer of AI around my business and the reason we need a business model by the way is cuz like you need some way to actually like some mechanism of making money some value creation in the case of AI agencies it's helping businesses to understand and input uh and actually get adoption to stick in them.

### 🌟 セクション 16

So whether you're e-commerce, SMMA, service based businesses like roofing or whatever that is the business model at the core of this and the AIOS methodology is just adding layers of AI around that to help you manage it. So first layer might be context OS. Second one might be uh data OS. One of the first things I did was went and pulled all of my different data sources, my P&Ls, uh my Google Analytics, my YouTube data, all my marketing sheets and and sales numbers and was able to instead of having them all over the marketplace, pull them all into a single database that's stored locally on my machine within the cloud code setup and then be able to build dashboards off that so that I can in the morning see a full uh full breakdown of all the most important numbers in my business and it's like my mission control. So you could call that like another layer around it.

### 🎬 セクション 17

And from there it's just like it's it's the most addicting video game I've ever played. Like me and me me and the guys here haven't been able to sleep daily. I've been going to sleep at 2 3:00 a.m. waking up at at 7:00 just to get back onto this stuff because it actually feels like I'm making real progress. Um when you build software and build automations, it's like check that's done.

### 📋 セクション 18

Like that is going to be handled for the foreseeable future unless something changes or breaks and in which case you can very easily fix it as well. But so what happened with me is I got addicted and kind of hooked into adding these layers and layers and layers of like well anything that I can think I can ask this thing to do and it's got to wrap it around my business and have access to it through my Telegram. Now there's a little bit of nuance as to how to get the most out of Telegram. And this may sound a bit like Claudebot. You'll be like how is this different to openclaw or Claudebot?

### ⭐ セクション 19

I'll probably do a whole video breaking that down. So if you think back to that claude code harness that I have the little ball on the cube, the cube has had millions or hundreds of millions of dollars at this point spent on it to make a really great harness around it. And what Open Claw or Claudebot did was take the model out, the the C base model, rip it out of that really expensive and well-gineered harness and put it in some kind of shoddy harness. Like no disrespect to the dude. Incredible work.

### 📝 セクション 20

I could not have done that myself, but it's a shoddy harness. It's like ripping the arms off pl code which is very natively excellent at a lot of the things you needed to do agentically. Ripping the arms off and then sticking some like like for example web search. Web searching comes native in claude code. You have to add it on as an add-on to your claudebot.

### 💡 セクション 21

So that's just a little bit of a teaser if you want to get my full breakdown on like it's it's been pretty hard for me to actually convince people to quit and move over to this when they just they don't really see the benefits. But over the long term, uh, you might get a get a lot of quick results with clawbot cuz it's a lot more beginner friendly at the beginning, but you'll plateau, whereas with a claw code set up, it seriously is like infinite. So, getting back to these layers of AI around the business. I've just continued to stack them more and more and more. I've got a daily brief OS that uh plugs into my meeting intelligence OS.

### 🔧 セクション 22

I'm trying to come up with naming naming conventions here, guys. Like, give me a give me a second to figure it out. But this these different operating systems that you could plug in. I guess it doesn't really make sense if you have a business OS or AIOS and you have another operating system inside it. But you get the idea.

### 🎯 セクション 23

These are kind of modules. I don't know what to call them. Modules or plugins or yeah modules plugins. I'm going with modules at the moment really. And that is the case.

### 💭 セクション 24

We are like having to map this new a new area out. This feels just like when I got into into AI business and we're like trying to figure out how to make money with AI and the business models that we could make money with. And we ended up finding an AI automation agency. This is the same thing. We've found this model of business methodology and I've been doing workshops every single day in my accelerator for the commas in there as we're actively like sharing all the knowledge around.

### 📌 セクション 25

I'm sharing what I'm doing. They're sharing what they're doing. I'm trying to figure out what you guys don't know and what sort of knowledge gaps I need to fill. So, if you are wanting to get like directly into this, um I don't ever really pitch my accelerator on these videos, but if you do want to be in the community that is spearheading the discovery of the stuff and the mapping of the landscape, can be the first to apply this AGI stuff to your business, um then you can book a call with one of my team in the description to see if it's a good fit for you. Meeting intelligence is if you got Firefox or Fathom, you're able to grab the API key, pull all of that into a database locally, then you're able to chat and you can say, "Hey, remember in that meeting that I had two weeks ago with Jimmy?

### ✅ セクション 26

can you please just dig in and see what I said that I'll do or can you please see if he mentioned this uh and this so that's just the start then you can add things like Slack OS where you can plug into your Slack get all the messages that have been sent over the past 24 hours and then you can start to roll these modules into sort of bigger functions like I have a daily brief OS which analyzes all the calls that happen across my entire business over the past 24 hours. It will also do the same for Slack and analyze what happened and from that information and also all the context it has about my business cuz it loads in the context OS. It will be able to see the big picture, help me identify patterns in the sales team, coaching team, all of that. Give me content recommendations off the back of that like, hey, content gap that you can make in your program or you could put into uh your YouTube videos. And it also acts as a like a co-CEO or strategist uh business strategist because I tell it to given everything you know there, can you please see if there's any like do a SWAT analysis?

### 📚 セクション 27

I get it to do a SWAT analysis on the business and so I know my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats and things that I just need to be aware of. And it means I don't have to keep up with everyone. I don't need to be monitoring Slack nearly as much as I used to. And so I think you kind of get the point. I've layered things onto this more and more and more.

### 🔖 セクション 28

My productivity OS so that I've got a full productivity system in there. I can just chat through Telegram on my computer or my phone and I can say, "Hey, I just finished this or uh I've just got a new task that I need to send to this or a new project." and it can automatically update that and it checks in with me throughout the day to say, "Hey, how are you going with your tasks? By the way, we've got all this stuff in your inbox, which is another thing. Capture OS, like a lot's going on. Um, but you have to build this up in layers and layers and layers to really get the most out of it.

### 🎨 セクション 29

So, for me, I've got so many layers here that it's really starting to get a lot thicker. And once I've got a lot of these set up and I've got better management of my productivity, daily brief, etc., meeting intelligence. Um, even like being able to automate my inbox, so it's attached to my iMessage and and WhatsApp and Gmail and stuff. So any incoming messages, I will get briefed in the morning and I can just say, "Hey, yeah, say this to them. Say this to that." And it's going to send all those messages cuz I hate having to check my WhatsApp and and messages.

### 🚀 セクション 30

I just have really slow reply. And then with that all under your belt, you've got the sort of breathing room or space to start getting into chopping away at these sections. So over the next few weeks, I'm going to be trying to cross off as many of these that's going to be up there. But I'm already a decent amount of the way through a bunch of these main ones being like editing, ideation, scripting. Uh this whole section here on my agency is actually already covered by a tool that we built for really internal use called autoflow.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Um you guys can't get access to that just yet, but if you are an AI agency um and you want to get access to that, just keep an eye on my socials and stuff for the next over the next few weeks. We'll be letting more people into the beta there. So we've already got a big chunk of the agency operations handled there with our own tool. And then it gets down to things like where the value is really being created like MVP development and actual development systems for my engineers. And I'm actually booking a session with my engineers at Morningside next week to walk them through the end toend engineering pipeline that I've created.

### 🌟 セクション 32

I can literally take a feature or an NDP or a spec from a client and just crunch through it non-stop for 1 2 3 days, however long it takes, testing all of its work. And I mean that's a whole video on its own, but we are we are cooking on medium high here and I'm really excited to share this stuff with you as well if you're in our agency owner. So I think you get the picture here, but I just want to give you guys the big picture of my plan. I'm trying to get 60 to 70% of these crossed off. I'm a decent chunk of the way there already.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So if you want to keep in the loop on how I go with this and want to see sort of the behind the scenes, I'm doing a lot of vlogs out here at the moment. So you'll be able to see me and the guys all nerding out about this uh trying to do the same thing with their business as well. So ton of source if you want to get a full breakdown. There's so many people who want to know about this stuff and so many business owners who are excuse my French for [ __ ] around with openclaw and not getting any and like getting frustrated and biting into the wall because it is limited as a platform. I'm trying to convert as many people over to this system because I see uh the light at the end of the tunnel that we may not have to to work anywhere near as much as we used to.

### 📋 セクション 34

So if you guys want to understand the system a bit more, see how exactly how I'm running it, I'm doing a webinar. Uh the link will be in the description and I wanted to do that format to get as many people in as possible. When you sign up to that webinar, you'll also get access to my daily telegram where I'm just dropping all the source like every time I find a new one of these I'm dropping voice notes in there constantly just giving all of the like I'm calling it ground zero for AIOS. All the information is being poured in there and then also you get signed up for a daily digest that summarizes my learnings and the people around me who are here cooking up into an email for you. If you're an email person, you'll get a daily email summarizing the learnings we're getting, the new territories that we're charting out so that you can start to apply those in your own system.

### ⭐ セクション 35

And most importantly, in that webinar, not only am I going to show you my system and how I've got it set up, I'll be walking you through how to set it up for yourself and giving you my starter template to do this cuz it's really important to get that folder structure right. And I've also built in a ton of what they call slash commands or skills to really help you as a completely non-technical person if you are. I've been testing this with the people around me, completely nontechnical people. if you give them the right uh set of instructions to give the chord code, it can act as a as a consultant or a helper to walk you through figuring out what you want and how it can help you to build it. So, all of that is going to be packing to that webinar.

### 📝 セクション 36

It's going to be a freaking awesome one. I'm so excited to be sharing this with you guys. But since the webinar is a live one, you're going to have to wait a while for that date to roll around. So, if you interested, of course, apply to that. But if you want to get access right now to the information that I'm discovering as I chart this out as the guys around me here in this house are working this stuff out.

### 💡 セクション 37

I'm also doing those workshops on my accelerator every single day. We're actively charting out this landscape together and I'm in there helping them plan and execute on those plans for building their AOS system. I hope you guys are as excited as I am for this stuff. Never been a better time to get into business. Never been a better time to be alive.

### 🔧 セクション 38

And if you aren't already subscribed, I'd make sure you do that because I'm going to be dropping so much sauce here over the next few weeks. You do not want to miss any of that. But yeah, be excited guys. Webinar link in the description. I look forward to seeing you there.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Um, and we can step into this AGI era together. If you want to watch my previous video on this topic explaining why I think AGI is here based off this stuff, that's going to be linked up here. But that's all for the video, guys. Thank you so much for watching. I'll see you in the next haul.
