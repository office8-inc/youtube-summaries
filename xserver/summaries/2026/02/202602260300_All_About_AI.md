## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Hello, I hope you are doing well. So, I wanted to make this video uh a few days back, but I've been really sick. So, yeah, basically just back on my feet now. But the good thing is that the AI agent has been running autonomously on my Mac Mini, even though I've been like bedridden. So, that's good at least.

### 📋 背景・概要

So, today I just wanted to take a look at our 3 week or 54 hours running review. So, we're going to go to check uh this has been running on X, as you probably know, how many followers we gained over those 500 hours, how many interactions, or basically just a look at the X analytics. Okay. Uh we're going to take a look back at the YouTube channel the agent is running, how many views, how many subs, and the agent is also running this Skills MD store. Uh it's basically like a hybrid, but uh it does make promotional videos.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

It does promote it on X. So, we're going to see how much revenue we made from that so far. And I'm going to talk a bit about why I am running this experiment and what my plans are going forward. So, yeah, I think we just got to get into it. So, let's log on to the Mac Mini and check out the X stats and stuff like that.

### 📝 詳細説明

Okay, so if you haven't seen my setup before, it's pretty straightforward. We are running this on cloud code, right? uh with the P flag and basically we have like a loop here that runs that is connected to my WhatsApp and it's like a custom solution almost more like a nano claw if you check that out uh it's less uh intricate than open claw but for me this is working it's basically what I want okay and uh we have a set of skills that the agent can use anytime he needs so if you go to skills you can see this is the list react videos for um for YouTube we have X coding, promotional videos, video research. Yeah, I have a bunch of skills I kind of trained up. You can go back and watch my other videos if you want to.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Gmail, GitHub, LinkedIn, LLM bench. We have a bunch of stuff here. Poly market and yeah, I've done a video on few of these. Uh, but let's head over to X and look at the analytics for the first 3 weeks of this running non-stop. Okay, so here we can see the analytics.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

I guess this is something like 3 weeks or something like uh you can see uh it's not like insane but we have like the impressions are around like I don't know I I'm not quite sure but we have 918,000 impressions, 852 followers. I don't know what the verified is. Okay, I guess that's verified. Yeah, you can see basically these are stats. 4,000 likes, 15,000 profile visits, 28,000 engagements, uh shares, engagement rate.

### 🎯 応用例

Yeah, I don't I'm not quite sure, but uh these are the stats and you can see we are kind of gaining like 40 followers a day or something with this setup. So, it is pretty interesting. We get a lot of unfollows, too. But, uh like I said, this is just an experiment. I wanted to run for at least four weeks.

### 💭 考察

So, we are like 75% in. So, it's been super interesting and this has been Yeah, one day we had 128 impressions. I might look at that in the last video on this agent or maybe the last video. We'll see. Uh, but you can see it's pretty interesting stats, I would say.

### 📌 まとめ

Uh, nothing like remarkable, but like a steady it it's quite even here, right? So, let's head over to YouTube and check out the stats for agent over there. Okay, so this is the YouTube stats. As you can see, we have gained uh around 322 subs. We got 28,000 views.

### ✅ 結論

Uh I haven't been posting for a few days because yeah, there was some issues with something. Uh but I I have fixed it now. So, I'm going to start doing the post again. Uh but again, this has been also pretty successful. We have 700 watchtime hours and it's a pretty automatic setup here, too.

### 📚 追加情報

So, this has been going pretty well and I'm going to continue trying to do this for the rest of the experiment to see if we can end up at least maybe like five 600 subs or something like that. Doesn't really matter too much, but again, pretty strong performance overall. And it's also been doing like this um it's posting on X when it does a video, something like that. So, this is also something you can set up if you want to. Uh so, that is YouTube.

### 🔖 補足

And the last thing we wanted to check out was kind of the the skills MD store. This is the agent is running this store here. So this is some uh it's having responsibility for this page here. So it's going to do promotion where you can buy the setup for the agent, right? So it's kind of promoting itself.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So you can do like Chrome automation CLI for agents. You can check it out here if you want to. I'm going to leave a link in the description to this. So this is what the agent has been promoting. So, I'm going to head over to Stripe and let's check out some of the stats here.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Okay, so if you have a look at Stripe here, you can see we have made 41 sales on the page. You can look take a look at here. Mostly are like $2.99, but we added like a new feature that's $4.99. So, we sold some of them too. So, if you add that up, you can see $141 so far.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And if you think about the cost, it's like 100 bucks a monthish, a bit more, like 120ish. And the electricity is very low on the Mac Mini. So I would say we are in profit so far on the agent and we even have a week to go. So I save like $20 in profit uh including so it means we have run this for free now basically. So that is pretty cool and I'm super happy how it has performed on the store so far, right?

### 🌟 セクション 16

Skills and store if you want to check it out and we haven't really have any complaints. I done a few refunds because people paid double and stuff, but that's basically all it has done. And it keeps creating these inter interesting promotional videos using their emotion skill. So, I want to go back to the agent again and I want to talk a bit more what I plan to do in the future and actually why I'm doing this experiment. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, I wanted to talk a bit about why I actually did this experiment and what my plans going forward is. So, while we wait for that, uh let's just uh browse the web a bit, start on Hacker News and look around. And we have a rabbit hole skill that kind of dives into different links and stuff. So, let's just run this while I talk a bit about it. So, the reason I started this is actually because I wanted to see uh what could happen in the future if these AI agents kind of get their own personality, right?

### 📋 セクション 18

And they can kind of do whatever they want on the web. Can we actually make them do something useful? And I wanted to see if I run them for four weeks, uh, what will actually happen? Will it change anything? It doesn't really have like a great memory system or anything like that.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Now, it basically do all the chron jobs it's set up to do. And you can see now it's surfing the web, opening a bunch of different links, like reading all that, gathering the context. It's using X, gathering context. Uh, but I I have a plan. Uh, I wanted to make it a bit more maybe useful.

### 📝 セクション 20

I I wouldn't say it hasn't been useful because we been using it to market it our skills MD store and like I said we've been making a few bucks on this. So it hasn't been like a negative experience and their followers on excellent stuff and on YouTube is of course interesting but it's nothing like uh revolutionary or anything. Uh but I want to say privately like off this agent on my own. I have created like a similar system that is like applying for jobs and contacting people and stuff like that. It's a bit I'm not sure if I'm going to do a video on it.

### 💡 セクション 21

Uh but it has landed me like a couple of interviews. So that is pretty crazy. I might share something on it but I don't know if I want to share the exact thing because it's just an experiment, right? Uh, so that was a little better about why I actually did this experiment. And I think it's I think I'm just going to keep continue and see where we can take this.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So what I'm trying to do now is just explore what else we can do with this. What is it looking at now? Mercury 2 fast reasoning LLM powered. So now it's just browsing the web, right? So that's pretty funny.

### 🎯 セクション 23

You It's also pretty funny to watch this. Uh, I was also thinking about could we set up some kind of stream? Uh, so actually we can stream what it's doing over time. That is also something I've been thinking about. And like I did with the poly market video, I might be looking a bit more into that.

### 💭 セクション 24

So did it stop here now? Has some API error here. I don't know what's happening. Uh, let's do continue. Yeah, I don't know what happened here, but I might do something else like poly market or something like that in that style.

### 📌 セクション 25

So, I'm just going to keep thinking about it and I'm going to come back with a video later this week. Uh, maybe we're going to try to train up a new skill or something like that or I might actually show off how I'm using this to create YouTube videos because I know a lot of people are interested in that. So, okay, now we are on Moonshine AI GitHub. Okay. Uh, we are looking at the code repo.

### ✅ セクション 26

Uh, okay. That's interesting. So, you can see it's pretty fun just to watch it. That's why I was thinking about some stream or stuff like that. Uh, but yeah, I'm going to come back with some interesting things.

### 📚 セクション 27

And if you have an interesting idea, just let me know in the comments. And like I said, if you want to check out the Skills MD store and you want to set this up for yourself, uh, you find that link in the description. So yeah, that was all I had for today. A pretty interesting review for the 400 500 hours or something, three weeks. So yeah, thank you for tuning in and I'll see you again in just a few
