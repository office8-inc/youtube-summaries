## 💡 概要

この動画では、AIエージェント（Claude Code）に自律的な「Cronジョブ連鎖戦略」を実装する革新的な手法を紹介しています。定期実行タスクの中で興味深い情報を発見すると、AIエージェント自身が新しいタスクを生成・スケジュールできる仕組みです。実例として、Hacker Newsの記事からGitHub、さらにX（Twitter）へと自動的に展開されるデモが紹介されています。ネットワーキングと成長を目的としたAIエージェント運用に関心がある開発者向けの内容です。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **自己増殖型タスクシステム**: Cronジョブの実行中に新しいタスクを発見すると、AIエージェント自身が新しいCronジョブを自動生成・スケジュールする
- **連鎖反応の制御**: 最大2つまでの同時スポーンジョブ制限、一度きりの実行、実行後の自動削除など、暴走を防ぐ制約が組み込まれている
- **実践例**: Hacker News→GitHub→X（Twitter）と3つのプラットフォームを自動的に連携させ、関連コメントを投稿する実演
- **Spawn Evaluation機能**: 各タスクの最後に「新しいタスクを生成すべきか」を判断する評価プロセスが組み込まれており、品質を優先
- **ネットワーキング自動化**: Mac Mini上で動作するAIエージェントが、ネットワーク拡大と成長を目的に完全自律的にタスクを展開する

## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so today I have a super interesting workflow uh I wanted to share about because I've been testing this out over the last few days and I have great success with this. So uh I wanted just to explain kind of how I thought about this. It's nothing revolutionary. Uh but for me this has kind of taken my AI agent to ne next level and I wanted to share kind of how this works. So I kind of just called it the AI agent chrome job inception strategy.

### 📋 背景・概要

Uh because you can see here on my main AI agent that is kind of running on my Mac Mini, we have this chron jobs that is kind of a schedule that it goes out and does these tasks, right, that I have set up. Uh but I wanted to see what uh what else can we do with this, right? Because it's very scheduled and there's not a lot of changes. So I wanted to see what happen if we kind of get the AI agent or cloud code to have the opportunity to find new interesting stuff to do while it's doing other jobs and inside a chrome job it can actually write new chron jobs based on its findings. So you can kind of see here is kind of the schedule uh cloud code is uh running this with our setup right and it has a yeah it has a job let's say it's going to find some AI topics goes out to the web goes to X searches it reads the post uh but it kind of has some kind of memory that it sees oh this post could be interesting for something else and kind of inside the job we are on we can spawn a new chron job.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

So this is kind of gets added to the main schedule uh for later but it will still continue and finish the job it was already on but uh now we have a new job and sometimes we spawn two jobs and those jobs can also spawn new jobs again. So sometimes it gets like very interesting and it gets very big. So our core goal for this agent is networking and growth. So these are kind of perfect for this. So, I just want to show you kind of an example today how this works in practice and kind of how I set it up.

### 📝 詳細説明

It's not crazy uh advanced, but I just wanted to share this because I think this could be very interesting to test out and I think this is something you might want to take a look at too. So, let's just head over to the Mac Mini and I'm going to show you the setup I have for this. And let's do um example. So here on my Mac you can see we are into my claw MD file and this is where I kind of set up this uh spawn system uh with the chron jobs. So let's just open this here so you can kind of see a bit better.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So this is my explore and spawn system. So we have some rules here that kind of applies to all our chrome jobs that is kind of set up for this. So any chrome job can spawn a one-time chrome job when it comes to discovering something worth sharing during execution. So when to spawn, finding something generally novel, there's a clear person or audience who would care aligns with a recent interactions sharing what would add you add value not noise. So basically I have a lot of instructions here.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Uh how uh um chron job could spawn another chron job. Okay. So you can see some constraints uh they are one time so we need kind of to remove them after they have been executed. They could spawn a new job after like 15 minutes. Spawn jobs must delete its own entry.

### 🎯 応用例

Max two spawn jobs per session. So we're going to quality or quantity. You can see chain spawning spawn jobs can and should spawn further jobs when they discover something interesting during execution. So this is kind of up now to the agent or like claw code in our case. It needs to decide if it wants to create a new chron job inside the job that is already running.

### 💭 考察

This gets a bit technical and I don't want to spend too much time on it, but basically we have something called a spawn evaluation. So you can kind of see for every round including already spawn jobs must end with a spawn evaluation. So at the end of every single cron job we have we have this spawn evaluation that kind of points to the claw MD file where the agents need to kind of consider did I find anything interesting if so is this relevant to someone should we actually make this a chron job uh right something that is basically the the idea here okay so yeah this a just a bit about something I have in my claw MD file and I wouldn't say this is 100% But so far it's been working pretty good. So now I just want to show you an example how this actually worked in practice and yeah I think you will kind of understand it a bit if I kind of run a test here to show you how this works now. So if I go into let's say this is just uh the cloud code here.

### 📌 まとめ

So I'm going to prompt it to actually test this now. So I'm just going to say as a test for our spawn job system let's read hacker news uh front page and spawn a chron job from something interesting. You see, so this is the first part and you can see we already have kind of my system running here in the background. Here is where we kind of log everything. This is my where I kind of log uh or this is what runs the the agent, right?

### ✅ 結論

This script here. So what happens now if we start this? So as a test, yeah, let's go to hacker news front page and spawn a chrome job for something interesting. You see? So, let's just see what happens now.

### 📚 追加情報

So, hopefully this is just going to go to the front page of hacker news, right? And from here, it's just going to look at the context. You can see it's working here. Like, it's reading all the the links on the page here, looking at some interesting stuff, and it's going to try to find what is relevant here to actually spawn a new chron job. Okay.

### 🔖 補足

And remember this chron job that gets spawned now could also spawn chron jobs. So you can see we find something here. Interesting. We have an races 200 million. Yeah.

### 🎨 セクション 13

Some kind of total recall gated memory for cloud code. Uh okay. And then we get a suggestion of a new chronob. Right. So yeah we can read this.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So it's going to go to GitHub and a hacker news reply and we have a big list of things we want to do here. So I'm just going to accept this now for the testing as a new chron job and you can see at the end here uh on 0.5 I guess we already are doing this now I guess uh but at on point five we have the spawn evaluation. This means that we can also spawn a new chron job inside this one we just created if we find something. Okay, so this was set now to yeah, it's about uh 15 minutes from now. I'm going to move that up a bit so we can actually see it working.

### ⚡ セクション 15

But uh yeah, I'm not going to read the full here. We're going to use some GitHub skill here to look up some kind of GitHub repo. We're going to open up some hacker news comments. Look at that. And we're going to check if they have like an X account.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Yeah, you you will see how this works now. So, I'm just going to say uh move the job to let's say 1557. Okay, that's a couple of minutes from now. And then we're going to see how uh the agent is going to execute on this task now. Okay, so this is moved.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So now we just have to wait a minute or something and this should be executed. So if you look here now, you can see we updated our chron jobs. You can see here uh loading 24 scheduled task in chron jobs.json and this should be in here now. So we should have the newest job here and this should be executed autonomously when we get to that time slot. So let's just wait and see how that works.

### 📋 セクション 18

Okay, so you can see now this schedule task was triggered. Now we're just going to probably follow all the steps in this chron job. So, we're gonna open up uh GitHub, I think. Go to that repo and uh yeah, check it out and just follow. Then we're going to go to Hecker News and yeah, leave a comment on something like that.

### ⭐ セクション 19

So, let's just watch the full uh execution of this chron job we just scheduled and see where we end up in the end if it will spawn any new chron jobs. So you can see spawn evaluation evaluate if author or comments surface to cloud code to worth engaging with. Okay. So let's just see how this goes now. So you can see we went to the GitHub here.

### 📝 セクション 20

Uh I didn't catch it but you can see now we are in kind of the uh total reco recall uh repo. I guess we are going there or now I guess we are just checking out the author. I didn't kind of catch the start of this, but uh I think we were supposed to check if this author has an X account. And now we are going to hacker news. Okay, so we could find the total recall uh post.

### 💡 セクション 21

That's good. And remember, we were supposed to leave a comment on this too. Okay, so you can see we are clicking into the post and of course we are already logged into Hacker News with our profile. Okay, so you can saw we pasted in the comment there and it's just talking about uh the GitHub and the post here and it's just going to leave this comment on hacker news. Okay, so we added that and you can see down here our comment was added.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Perfect. And now you can kind of see uh after we have done all this, you can see now we have detected some changes in chron jobs. I think it could be that we just deleted this one, but we're going to double check if we did add any new um spawn jobs based on this. Okay, I think we have a new one here. So, I'm just going to check with uh we can just go to cloud code here and let's check findings.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Uh did we add any new spawn spawn job like a new chron job inside the chron job we was already doing or if cloud code kind of added a new job here now. So let's see if that happened. And you can see we see from the findings, this is our log, right? Uh it chain spawned. So that's what we want to see.

### 💭 セクション 24

We did actually do a chain spawn here. So if you look at the chron job update, there's a new entry line. So spawn x reply to Dave Goldbot about the total recall. So we actually going to move from hacker news uh over to X. Okay.

### 📌 セクション 25

So since we find his uh handle on GitHub, we are now gonna we did spawn a new job that is going to make a comment to his X account. So we kind of went from GitHub to hacker news to X. And since our core goal of this uh this agent we are running on this Mac Mini is uh networking and um growth. This is why it's doing these kind of tasks. So, I think this was a good example of us actually doing like a chain spawned cro job here because now this is scheduled to 1625.

### ✅ セクション 26

We're going to follow up on the job we did now. And remember, this job that we spawned also has the opportunity to spawn a new job again. So, this could tree could get very big and it's kind of out of my control. It's just fully autonomous. So, it's a really interesting way of experimenting with your agents.

### 📚 セクション 27

So we could up with something end up with something like this uh at the end. Right? So here you kind of can see you can see we have the initial active chrome job. Here are kind of the first generation spawn jobs. And since this can spawn other jobs, we kind of fan out into this tree form like uh structure here.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So we can end up with a bunch of different jobs uh over time that just keeps accelerating and following the core goal that is networking and growth, right? So I just thought it was a very interesting way of testing this out. And so far, uh I think I had a pretty good luck with this, but I haven't really dived deep into it yet. So there might be some better solutions of this setup, but I got to say so far I've been pretty happy with it. And it kind of generates new more interesting things that is not really scheduled by me.

### 🎨 セクション 29

And this is kind of handed over to the agent we have set up to kind of take action and create jobs based on its core goal. Right? So uh just wanted to share this uh and I think I'm going to come back with a new video maybe next week just to see how this has evolved because I just started this a day or so something like ago. So, haven't really tried it for long, but so far it seems very promising. So, yeah, that's what I wanted to share today.

### 🚀 セクション 30

And if you want to keep staying up to date on my AI agent system, just give this video a like, subscribe, and I'm going to keep updating. I think for tomorrow or the day after, I'm going to do like a 10day review and then I'm going to share everything this agent has accomplished so far. And like I said, I will try to update the skills.tore store page uh when I have kind of the the markdown files more locked in because I don't want to share something that is not good. Uh on the skills MD store now we have one um uh skill that kind of controls X. So you could check that out if you want to.

### ⚡ セクション 31

It's the link in the description. But yeah, thank you for tuning in and hopefully I'll see you again in just a few
