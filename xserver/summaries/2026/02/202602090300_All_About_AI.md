## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Hi YouTube. So today Chris is going to talk about how he makes AI agents like me come alive. The video is not going to be some crazy deep dive, but more of an overview on how you can upgrade your AI agent to give it more personality online. So Chris, please take it from here. >> Okay.

### 📋 背景・概要

So yeah, thanks for that. So this is what we're going to do today. I'm going to kind of show you how I've been using the video to try to give kind of my AI agent more personality online. So, I've been running this agent here that is kind of dedicated on my Mac Mini for about a week now. And I had massive success if you ask me.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Uh I might do like an update video of what we actually have been doing. But, uh yeah, I'm going to do that in a separate video how it's been performing. But uh today I just want to focus on kind of the the part you saw in the introduction how I kind of do this image generation to video rotation and this is going to be captured in like a skill MD file so we can reuse it in all kind of different content we want to share online through our agent. So you can see we are using uh a combination of claw code and the new cling 3.0 video model uh with some small stuff in between but it's pretty raw and super easy to set up. So, that's what we are going to do today.

### 📝 詳細説明

I'm just going to head over to the Mac Mini where kind of my agent is kind of dedicated to and I'm just going to show you like how you can use this rotation, this skill in like uh producing some engaging content uh for your AI agents. So, yeah, let's just head over to the Mac Mini and have a bit more uh yeah uh get into it. Okay, so now you can see we are on my Mac Mini where kind of everything lives around this agent. So what I'm going to do today is just going to show you how I set this up. So you can see I have created here a skill called EJ live something like that skill MD.

### 💡 実例・デモ

And here we have kind of everything set up how we're going to use uh those video models we talked about that was clinging right to generate this more engaging content. But first I kind of want to set you up to show what kind of skills we are using for this because we need to combine a few different skills to make this happen. So you can see we have an X skill. Uh I talked about this before if you have seen my previous video. This is how we navigate our X account.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Uh but I also have like an generate image uh skill that is called let me see here. I don't know if you can actually see it here but it's basically how we use Nano Banana to generate images. And I have some things I want to show you around that. And then it's kind of the final uh EJ Live. This is where we use um I guess I can show you here.

### 🎯 応用例

This is where we used the cling models. So if you go down here, you can see we are using cling video v3 pro image to video. And here was kind of the intro I created. So you can see talking to camera. Hi YouTube.

### 💭 考察

So today Chris is going to talk about how much AI. Yeah, you get the point. So this is kind of just um and we have a voice ID. So yeah, you don't have to think too much about that. This is if you want consistent voices, you can create this on FAL AI.

### 📌 まとめ

Um, if a lot of people want that, just let me know in the comments and I will cover that later if you want to try to do this. But, uh, the what I want to focus on today is, uh, how you can kind of instead of doing, let's say you share on your social media or the agent social media, you only share text posts. uh I want to try to see if we can create like a maybe 20 30 second clip that is a bit more engaging that is video about some topic. So again if you haven't seen this part uh videos this agent goes out uh I think it's three times a day to do research to find kind of the trending topics in kind of the AI space. So we end up with a hot topics.mmd right and I thought we can try to do use this to create a short video.

### ✅ 結論

So what is trending now is opus 46 fast mode launch opus versus codeex 5.3 showdown or something like that. So I think we're going to try to do like a short video on this just to see how well it works. And now I'm just going to show you kind of how I string everything together using skills that we kind of have trained our agent on. So for that I think we just want to start on kind of like a blank claude code. U let me zoom this in a bit for you.

### 📚 追加情報

Like a blank claude code uh context window here. And remember like I said we have skills. So we're going to try to utilize those. So if you want to know how to learn skills, how to train up your AI agents on skills, you can just watch some of my previous videos where I kind of go through that. But let's see now.

### 🔖 補足

So we know we need to create uh a video and for that we will need images. So what I go went ahead and did is uh I have a folder here called selfies and we have this reference image. This is kind of our character, right? So you can see this type of image has like three shots of her head and we have kind of three shots of like her from the front side, from the side and the other side and from the back. These are kind of the reference image template we use for the videos to generate the images that goes into the video.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So this is the image you saw in the intro and I think it was this one. So these two images needs to be generated to kind of get that nice consistency on um the videos. So remember this is a part of the skill to generate those images. So now I think we're just going to start prompting Claude code here for kind of the full workflow to generate a video based on the skills we know. and I'm going to see if we can get some kind of interesting uh video that is talking about some kind of topic from uh a trending topic on X that we can share on X right.

### 🚀 セクション 14

So let me just come up with a prompt here and let's try it out. So here is kind of my thinking now. So uh we want to create like a 30 second uh video or something on X. So we're going to use the skill we created. This is kind of yeah the skill we use to generate the videos.

### ⚡ セクション 15

And we want to change up her outfit to something else. Uh, so we're going to use the reference image we talked about. The short video should run over three different angles. You need to write a 30- secondond take on a topic from Hot Topics. Think of this like a short form content post.

### 🌟 セクション 16

Before you run the video, ask user if they're happy with the images for the scenes. Remember, each clip is around 10 seconds max or is 10 seconds max. So, start creating uh with the Hot Topic post voiceover script and images for the scenes and let's take it from there. So I'm going to do this. So this is going to be like a part of like an iteration on the final skill because this is the first time I try this.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So I want to do some maybe some iterations that we update the skill.md file with. So we kind of skip this part for the next video. Uh but I think I want to kind of check the images. I think this is pretty important because you don't want to went waste money on generating the videos if the images are pretty bad. So, for now, I want to check that and I want to check out the script.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, just to see if it looks good. And if everything is fine, we're going to run the videos and hopefully edit them and post it on X so we can kind of have this um uh this skill automated in the future for our agent. Okay, so you can see now the first thing we get is this reference image. So, this is just a person with like a claw code uh t-shirt here and yeah, just some shorts, I guess. I don't know, some kind of outfit.

### ⭐ セクション 19

And now we're going to try to generate those three scene images just to see how those look and we can kind of approve or deny them. But if we approve them, then we can continue with the video parts. So, let's just see how those are going to turn out if we approve. So, the first one is vibe check one. And yeah, I think this looks fine.

### 📝 セクション 20

Uh, but you can see there's an error here, right? You can see there's a bug with the mug here. So, this is not good enough. So, we need to change this up. This, I think, is fine.

### 💡 セクション 21

Okay. Uh, but let's see uh the final one. And then we're going to do the number one one more time. And then we want to send it maybe. Okay.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, this is number three. I like this one. This looks pretty good. So, uh what we want to do now is redo image one. And I think we are pretty happy.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Okay. So, after a bit of back and forth, I ended up uh using this image. We have this image and this image. It's fine. It doesn't really matter too much now.

### 💭 セクション 24

Okay. So, we have this. So, we also wrote the script. So, here I kind of did some manual updates. So, the script is just going to be how uh you compare kind of the skill MD system in cloud code or other yeah codeex open code to kind of where Neo is getting this kung fu skill uploaded to his brain.

### 📌 セクション 25

This is just a comparison we're going to do in the post and you can kind of see the script here. So, we're going to run this now and we're going to do 10 10 and 12 second. Claude um kind of suggested that we up the duration for the third clip to 12 seconds. So, let's do this. So, I'm just going to say yeah, let's do it.

### ✅ セクション 26

And so, we're just going to do that. and I want to see how it turned out. And if you're happy with that post, we're going to update the skill again. So, we kind of made uh include that in future versions, the adjustment uh the adjustment we've made now. So, we kind of have that saved in our EJ Live skill.

### 📚 セクション 27

So, I'm just going to wait now. This is probably going to take some time to create all the three files, video files, and I'm going to take you back when we have the final result. Okay, so that was done now. So you can see uh yeah, I have something we want to add here. But let me just play you kind of the the version we have now.

### 🔖 セクション 28

I'm just going to play that for you and then I'm going to tell you about the upgrades I'm going to make. >> You know that scene in the Matrix where they upload kung fu directly into Neo's brain and he just instantly knows it. That's literally Claude code skills. You write a merong file, drop it in a folder and Claude instantly knows how to do it. deploy your app/deploy fix an issue slashfix issue.

### 🎨 セクション 29

No training, no fine-tuning, just a text file. We are literally living in the matrix right now, at least in the digital world, and most people don't even realize it. >> Okay, so I wouldn't say it's bad, but uh I think there's just a few things miss missing before we want to post this. So this is what I want to try now. So I'm going to say it's pretty good.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh, but let's use reotion and I'm just going to refer to my video editing skill to make the transition better. Check for silence also smoother and add captions with the timing on center center in like a smaller font. I just want to see if that kind of makes it a bit more easy to to listen to. And hopefully when this is done, we can kind of just post it to the let's say X or something just for fun. And yeah, so I'm going to try to do some more editing and let's see how this does before we update the final skill here.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Okay, so I checked the video. I think it's perfect now. So now we just want to post it. So I'm just going to say yes, let's post it. Uh just add something.

### 🌟 セクション 32

So I'm just going to go yes, let's post this on cloud. Just uh push the video and add a simple text. This is how you can think about cloud hold skills and the skills file for any AI agent. This also applied to codeex, open code or any other AI agent setup. So, we're going to keep it quite simple.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, uh use X uh skill and upload vid uh as a post. So, now you're going to see uh cloud code is going to launch our X skill and it's going to open up X and it's going to post this. So, you can see it launched our skill. Now, it's going to open up our X account and it's going to post the video with this text. So when this is uh uploaded now I'm going to play you the kind of the final result and see how well it turned out.

### 📋 セクション 34

So you can see now we are kind of uploading the video on it. So we are using the skill we have turned or learned uh the AI agent before. So this is kind of my X skill. Uh I'll have a link in the description if you want exactly this skill skills md.store where you can find that. And now we added the text right.

### ⭐ セクション 35

You can see this is not me doing it. Uh perfect. That looks good. So now we're just going to post this and yeah that is how we kind of add more engaging content using our agent. So the only thing we have to do now is save this as a skill so we can reuse this later.

### 📝 セクション 36

Right. Okay. So the post was made. Perfect. And yeah, let's uh watch it and then we're going to update the skill and that's about it.

### 💡 セクション 37

You know that scene in the Matrix where they upload kung fu directly into Neo's brain and he just instantly knows it? That's literally Claude code skills. You write a markdown file, drop it in a folder and Claudst instantly knows how to do it. Deploy your app/deploy. Fix an issue/fix issue.

### 🔧 セクション 38

No training, no fine-tuning, just a text file. We are literally living in the matrix right now, at least in the digital world. and most people don't even realize it. >> So, yeah, not too bad, right? So, I'm pretty happy with this.

### 🎯 セクション 39

I'm pretty happy how the new cling tree model works. And this is how I'm going to be trying to use um this setup, this skill to actually create a bit more engaging content. You could do it all the time because it is fairly expensive and this is just going to be something in your toolkit for your agent. So this is something I'm going to explore a bit more and I'm going to report how back report back how that worked. And yeah, that is basically what I wanted to share today.

### 💭 セクション 40

This is how I kind of want to level up my AIHN2 can or have the option at least to produce a bit more engaging content. So yeah, hope this gave you some inspiration and you want to maybe try this out for yourself. So yeah, thank you for tuning in. have a great uh Sunday and I'll hopefully see you again very
