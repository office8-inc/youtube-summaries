## 💡 概要

この動画では、子供を5人持つことが2人だけ持つよりも実は簡単だという意外な主張をしています。最初の2人の子育てで得た経験、知識、衣類などのリソースを活かせるため、3人目以降は効率的に子育てができます。また、上の子供たちが成長すると、家事を手伝ったり下の子の世話をしたりできるようになるため、親の負担は思ったほど増えません。この動画では、子供を2人で止めてしまうのは、せっかく得た子育てノウハウとリソースを無駄にしてしまう「重大なミス」だと説いています。

## ⭐ 重要なポイント

- **5人の子育ては2人とほぼ同じ難易度**：上の子が成長すると自立し、下の子の世話も手伝ってくれるため、親の負担は思ったほど増えない
- **リソースの効率的活用**：衣類、知識、経験など、最初の2人で得たものを3人目以降にそのまま活用できる
- **上の子の成長による支援**：9歳になれば簡単な家事ができ、12歳になればほぼ自立し、下の子育てを手伝える
- **2人で止めるのは重大なミス**：せっかく子育てスキルとリソースを築いたのに、そこで止めてしまうのは潜在能力の無駄遣い
- **経済的負担も同程度**：衣類など既にあるもので賄えるため、追加の経済的コストは思ったほどかからない
