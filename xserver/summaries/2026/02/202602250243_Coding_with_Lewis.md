## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Here are five crazy things that you didn't know that your browser could do. The first is WebGPU. This one is new, but WebGPU lets you get direct access to your graphics card. Yeah, this means that you can do lots of things like do physics simulations, run language models, or train neural networks. It's absolutely insane.

### 📋 背景・概要

Now, what if you could control your lights with a website, right? Bluetooth. Pretty nuts. The browser has access to Bluetooth, so you could control your devices or just kind of do what Bluetooth does. Uh, whatever.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Three is the web speech API. Speech recognition is built directly into the browser. Zero libraries, no API keys. It's honestly pretty fast as well. Not as good as something like Whisper, but I'm sure that you can think of something cool to do with this, especially on like lower-end devices.

### 📝 詳細説明

Four is the screenwalk API. A website can prevent your screen from falling asleep. Not sure I'll like that. A couple of lines of code and there you go. This is why recipe websites never turn off while you're cooking or reading 12 paragraphs about their childhood trauma.

### 💡 実例・デモ

I just wanted the chocolate chip cookies. And then last is the gamepad API. If you have a PS5 or Xbox controller, you can access full controls and control your controller with JavaScript, which is crazy. Now gamers don't have to leave incognito mode. Fall for more.
