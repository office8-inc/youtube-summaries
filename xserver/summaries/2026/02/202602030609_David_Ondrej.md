## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

My name is David Andre and in this video I'm going to show you how to build a web scraping AI agent. Now you need to start putting your AI agents to work because with web scraping your agents can become productive members of your life and business. For example, you can put an agent to find more leads for your business, grow your social media accounts, scrape job candidates, and so much more all by itself autonomously. And so first I'll explain what web scraping is. Then we'll look at how to plug it into your AI agent.

### 📋 背景・概要

And then I'll show you how you can scrape literally anything. So take a deep breath and pay attention. First off, what even is web scraping? Simply put, web scraping takes information from websites and turns it into data that you can actually use. So what would take you or me hours of copy pasting, a scraper can handle that in a matter of minutes or even seconds.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

Now, as I mentioned, you can use a web scraper to grow your business, make more money, or you can just check whether someone you know is in the files. Now, simple web search tools that many AI agents have are not enough. And that's because if you give your AI a simple URL, and feel free to try this now, it will often run into issues getting the contents from that website, especially sites like Twitter, Reddit, and LinkedIn are actively trying to block AI agents from visiting and reading the contents of their sites. But with a powerful web scraping tool, something like aify, you can scrape literally any website. And if applied properly, I would even say that web scraping can change your life.

### 📝 詳細説明

Here's what I mean. Your AI agent can literally generate leads for your business on autopilot. You can put him to script potential customers from LinkedIn, filter them, and even reach out to them. Or you can use an AI agent to track your competitors, look at their pricing, any new features, customer complaints, and know all of these things before even their team does. But let's say you don't have a business.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Well, web scraping can also help you find job opportunities or you can look for real estate listings proactively. Anything that either requires a fast response, you know, checking in a milliseconds, or lots of data that would take forever for a human to process. So, here is how scraping and AI agents work together nicely. A scraper collects the data, but data alone doesn't do anything. So then you have an AI agent.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

That agent can read thousands of results instantly to find what actually matters to you. But then let's take it a step further. The AI agent because it's an agent, it can act upon that data like a send an email, update a spreadsheet, send you alert, whatever you need it to do, all without you doing any manual work. And this is the beauty of building a web scraping AI agent. Now to make this easier, we can use agent skills.

### 🎯 応用例

Now, agent skills are pre-built instructions that you can give to your agents like claw code, agent zero, cursor. So, instead of writing and describing all of the logic for the scraping yourself, you simply install a skill and the AI agent instantly gains the ability to web scrape and then all you need to do is just talk to your AI agent in plain English and it will already know what to do and how to scrape websites. Yes, this is very OP. Now, there's a lot of web scraping tools on the market, but personally, I choose to use Appify and here's why. First off, they have over 4,000 scrapers that are already built for LinkedIn, Google Maps, Instagram, Tik Tok, anything you can imagine, it's already built.

### 💭 考察

And since Appify is a platform, you have everything you need in a single place. Plus, it's also nicely designed to integrate with AI. Oh, and thank you to Appify for agreeing to partner on this video. With that being said, let's get to building. The first step is go to appify.com and create an account.

### 📌 まとめ

So, just go to top right and click on sign up. Super easy. Takes 20 seconds. But if you already do have an account, you'll see this go to console button. So click on that and this will take you to the appy console.

### ✅ 結論

Now before we do anything I actually want to show you their GitHub for the agent skills because this is what lets us use it in cloth code open codebot which is also known as moldbot or open claw. Anyways anything that supports agent skills you can use epify inside of that. And as you can see they're constantly improving this 4 days ago 4 days ago 5 days ago 4 days ago. So this is a very active repo and it tells you everything about the agent skills that API offers and it also helps you install it which is just a single command but more on that later. Now let's go back to ampify console and let me show you the concept of actors because this is a key concept that you have to understand.

### 📚 追加情報

So inside of ampify on the left click on actors and here you'll see any actors you might have built. But if you have a new account it will look like this. So you have two options. You can either develop a new actor from scratch or you can go to the app store and just use one of the pre-built ones. As you can see, they have a lot of different options.

### 🔖 補足

Google Maps, website content crawler, Tik Tok, e-commerce scraping tool, Facebook post, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube. I mean, basically anything that you might want to scrape, Appify has it. Now, an Appify actor is just a serverless cloud program that takes a JSON input, then it runs a task like scrape a website, and at the end it spits out structured data. So, you can see on the left, this could be calling the actor with the input object. It runs, boom, it does what it needs to do.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So this is a screenshotting actor. So just take a screenshot and then it gives you a clear output structured data. Easy to use. Now inside of the appy store you can go to view all and here some of these actors are developed by appy themselves as you can see with the appy logo and the name but others are developed by thirdparty developers and this means that anybody can create their own actors. As you can see there's nearly 16,000 different actors for different websites.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Or if you are a developer, you can develop your own and if it's good, people will use it and it will make you money. So let's get started and let's build our web scraping AI agent. So first off, open your IDE of choice. VS code cursor windser doesn't matter and click on open project. Going to create a new folder scraper.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Boom. And open. So open an empty folder where we can actually build our AI agent. As you can see, there is no files, no folders in here. It's completely empty.

### 🌟 セクション 16

And when you're here, go to installation and copy this command. Then open your global terminal. So you can install this globally on your system and just paste this in. Boom. It's going to ask which skills to install.

### 🎬 セクション 17

There's 11 different ones. So I'm just going to select all of them cuz why not. Okay, let's cycle through them. We should have everything. Enter.

### 📋 セクション 18

For the different agents, we have AMP, anti-gravity, augment, clot code, open claw, also known as moldbot, also known as clawbot, client, codex, droid, cursor, everything possible. I think I'm going to go with open code, though. There we go. Boom. Enter.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Let's do global install. Sim link. Proceed to installation. Yes. Done.

### 📝 セクション 20

Beautiful. Let's do clear. Then switch back to our ID and type in open code right here. say list out all agent skills you have access to. Let's see if it will showcase the appy skills.

### 💡 セクション 21

There we go. Find skills ampify trend. Yes, beautiful. So now open code has access to all of these skills from aify. And obviously you can use the same agent skills with cloth code or any other agent out of these 40 agents that are supported.

### 🔧 セクション 22

Okay. So the next thing we need to do is we need to create an env file environment just env here type in apply token equals and then uh we need to get the token. So go back to the appy console scroll to the left settings API integration. Here you have your personal API token. Just copy it.

### 🎯 セクション 23

Go back. Paste it in. Boom. That should be good. Now some sources say that it should be appy_api token.

### 💭 セクション 24

So if it doesn't work try that but most most of the time it should work with ampify token. Now if we tell open code to use it it should be good. So we need to actually restart open code. So let me kill it with control c in the same terminal and type in open code. Obviously you can use cloth code as well.

### 📌 セクション 25

Doesn't matter. It's supported. So again let's ask this question to make sure that the appy skills are still there. Amazing. They're there.

### ✅ セクション 26

Now, for the first test, we're going to start with a simple request. Use Appify to scrape top 20 coffee shops in Austin, Texas from Google Maps. Get their names, ratings, review counts, and addresses. Save as a CSV. So, you can use it in many ways.

### 📚 セクション 27

Maybe you're just lover of coffee shops like one of my friends, Jack Roberts, or you want to sell software to coffee shops. You, you know, maybe coffee shop owners are ideal target avatar. Whatever it is, um, this could work. Okay, what's what's the issue here? MCP permission access.

### 🔖 セクション 28

Yes, allow once. It's trying to install some MCP servers ampify. Yeah, always allow. Let's click that. Pulling patterns open because restarted.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Confirm. Okay, so it fetched the actor schema. Now it will run the actor status running. We could see it in our appy. Okay, there we go.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh, do we see the runs? There it is. We can see the run. It's waiting for 20 results. It's costing 1 cent.

### ⚡ セクション 31

And there it is. Finished. 9 cents. Scraping finished. Google map scraper.

### 🌟 セクション 32

Let's go back. And it's saved the CSV. Just like that, we can open the CSV. And here's all the data in a comma separated values. Obviously, this is as concise as possible.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, it's really human readable format. But you can see the first uh names of these coffee shops. And okay, so open code is giving it us in a better format. But uh yeah, this took like what one minute to get. Yeah, 1 minute 45 seconds to get 20 different coffee shops in an actual country using Google Map Scraper with Appify, which Appify makes it super easy.

### 📋 セクション 34

Cost us 9 cents. Doing this manually would take you hours. I mean, not maybe not hours, but at least 1 hour, 90 minutes, something like that. And uh yeah, it took us 1 and 1/2 minutes, not one and a half hours with API, but we're just getting started. The other two use cases I'm going to show you will be much more impressive.

### ⭐ セクション 35

Now, I already showed you the concept of a run. So on the left inside of API console you can see the runs and this is basically history of all the executions that happened inside of API. But another thing you need to understand is the saved tasks. These are saved configurations that you can reuse multiple times. So when we go to actors you'll see that we used this one recently.

### 📝 セクション 36

And here when you click on it you can save it as a new task. So the same configuration could be reused, right? Because uh maybe you frequently look for the same coffee shops or same type of business in the same location. You don't want to be reprompting it every time, which again we it's much easier because we connected it to a powerful AI agent which is currently open code with cloth open 4.5. But if you want to do something inside of the UI of API, then using safe tasks is a very smart thing.

### 💡 セクション 37

All right, the next use case is something that every single business can do, and that is competitor analysis. So, here's my prompt. I run a solar panel installation company in Poland. Use API to script 200 reviews across my top 10 competitors from Trust Pilot. So, we're going to use a different actor, not Google Maps, Trust Pilot this time.

### 🔧 セクション 38

Once API returns the data, identify the patterns, what people love, what's making them leave, bad reviews, and complaints. Then create a single page HTML report summarizing your findings with actionable insights I can use to improve my own business. So the good news is that you can do this no matter what you do. Online business, in-person business, European, Asian, American business, doesn't matter. Another good news is that none of your competitors will do this, right?

### 🎯 セクション 39

This is such a free thing. Like if you just do this, your product will improve. You'll have better understanding of where your competitors are failing and where there are gaps that you can take advantage of. No competitors I I can guarantee you that easily. None of your competitors are building appi powered AI agents to analyze the market and to improve their product.

### 💭 セクション 40

So if you just do this one thing, you already have an unfair advantage in business. Now open code is asking for permission competitor intergener scripts. Okay, let's allow that. It's wanting to do a skill. Let's allow that inside of AP5.

### 📌 セクション 41

If we switch back, we could see uh uh uh another run. Not yet. Just act the schema. Okay. It needs to fetch the schema.

### ✅ セクション 42

It was first finding the top 10 solar competitors. Okay. Okay. So, it did another Google map scraper to find the competing companies, but then it's going to use Trust Pilot to find the actual reviews. And look at this.

### 📚 セクション 43

It even pivoted. Since they're limited Polish specific solar companies, I'll scrape reviews from the top European. So, it can solve problems by itself, right? That's why the agent skills from Appify are such a huge unlock. That's why this GitHub repo matters a lot because when you when you give it to a powerful AI agent like open code or cloth code or agent zero or clothbot or cursor you get the point any AI agent that supports agent skills you'll be able to use ampify super effectively and you don't need to know anything about web scraping yourself right you just get a connect it to open code and let it cook when it runs into a problem it will solve it by itself and keep going this is the power of AI agents with web scraping.

### 🔖 セクション 44

By the way, another thing you should know inside of Appify is schedules. So, you can automatically start your actors on a schedule, right? So, this is even simpler than creating a chrome job or anything automation. You can do that right inside of Appify console. So, you can click on create a schedule and either do a Chrome or just set it manually like every 10 minutes and create some powerful workflows that run, you know, hourly, daily, weekly, whatever you need.

### 🎨 セクション 45

at a specific time zone with some other settings as well, right from the Ampify dashboard. So, this is really a whole platform, right? It's not just a web scraper. It's a whole platform for web scraping that nicely integrates with AI agents thanks to their new agent skills. And again, I'm going to link this GitHub repo below the video as well as ampify.

### 🚀 セクション 46

Okay, let's check on our runs. What's happening here? And even though we had to start multiple actors at the same time, look at this usage. 200 reviews from this company was 0.03. actually 3 cents and you can see the breakdown when you hover over it.

### ⚡ セクション 47

Appify gives you a detailed breakdown of the cost of the usage. So you can see where the money goes. Very very nice. And now it's going two. Okay, it's going for 200 results per each company.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Uh that's not what I asked for. I asked 200 reviews in total. But hey, we're going to have a abundance of reviews, like 1.2,000 reviews. We'll see how open code handles that. All right, it's finished.

### 🎬 セクション 49

That took a few minutes. Let's go back. Let's see what Excel have collected views to five companies. They download all the data, consolidate it. Yeah, because it's 200 per company.

### 📋 セクション 50

So, it's going to be a lot more than I expected, but I think Opus 4.5 should handle this. No problem. I have now 1,130 reviews total, more than the 200 requested. Let me scrape a few more complete. What?

### ⭐ セクション 51

Okay. Okay. Enough scraping. You have all the reviews you reviews you need. Finish my request.

### 📝 セクション 52

That's crazy. I I had to interrupt it because uh I don't know why it's ask it's going for more reviews. 1,00 1 1,000 reviews is enough for this. Okay. I just wanted to do a quick demo, but it's going overboard.

### 💡 セクション 53

But hey, we're pushing uh Ampify to its limits, showing what it's capable of. And again, I want to stress this, like our total cost is $0.2. $2 for all the scraping. Thousands of different reviews of scraping. Like $0.2 to save yourselves dozens of hours, maybe even hundreds of hours.

### 🔧 セクション 54

It's pretty incredible. Let's see the distribution. Okay, so most are five star, then one star, four star. Nobody does two or three stars. Interesting.

### 🎯 セクション 55

Human nature, I guess. All right. Analyze review patterns, negative themes and complaints. Create an HTML report with actionable insights. And by the way, this is the power of agent skills.

### 💭 セクション 56

I didn't have to code anything for open code to interact with ampify. All we did, remember, all we did is we gave it this agent skill. So, it knows the schema for ampify and it can use it, right? Like we didn't have to do any coding here, any crazy setup. This is the power of agent skills.

### 📌 セクション 57

Brilliant. Of course, now it's going to write a long HTML file because I told it to do a single HTML file. There it is. 600 lines of HTML. We should now be able to open that folder and just uh look at this HTML file.

### ✅ セクション 58

Me switch. There we go. Solar panel industry analysis. 1,130 reviews analyzed. Six companies studied.

### 📚 セクション 59

4.25 average rating. 75% of five star reviews. These are the companies analyzed. Rating distribution. What customers love?

### 🔖 セクション 60

Customer support. Product reliability quality. professional installation, fast and reliable delivery, what drives bad reviews, pain points, warranty and return nightmares, slow and unresponsive support. So even if you just fix these in your company, assuming you were their competitor, you would probably already have the best product on the market. Recurring complaint patterns, the stalling tactic, multiple customers report companies deliberately delaying warranty claims until the warranty period expires.

### 🎨 セクション 61

Shady, shady offshore support frustration. Oh my god. Customers in Europe complain about support being run to Philippines or India. Asia is a code word for South Asia, which is India. Incomplete system solutions.

### 🚀 セクション 62

Yeah. So, if you just have a European customer rep, you already probably have the best uh best company. Incomplete system solutions equipment for providing installation guidance. Okay, it's also easy fix. Software app problems.

### ⚡ セクション 63

Yikes. They're probably not using uh latest AI agents. They're probably not subscribed to my channel. So, if you don't want to have these issues in your company, make sure to subscribe to stay on the cutting edge of AI. It's completely free.

### 🌟 セクション 64

It takes two seconds and it helps out a lot. So, go below the video and click subscribe. Okay. And some actionable insights from our business. Very nice report.

### 🎬 セクション 65

I mean, guys, just do this for your own business. Trust me, you'll be surprised what it shows. Now, lastly, we're going to do one more. Clear the clear. Let's start a separate open code and we're going to take it to the next level with the famously difficult Twitter scraping.

### 📋 セクション 66

So, we're going to test how Appify handles Twitter, which is like one of the hardest sites to scrape. So, here's the prompt. Using Appify, scraped 50 highest engagement AI related tweets from the top AI influencers over the past seven days. Build a web app where I can filter by engagement, see what formats are working, and save ideas to a swipe file. The fewer lines of code, the better.

### ⭐ セクション 67

So this is actually something I want myself. So let's see what it comes up with. Skills ampify always allow wants to access that skill. Let's see what we're looking like in our runs. Refresh this.

### 📝 セクション 68

I have the API token. Yes, you have it. Right. Do not share a token with anybody. I'm going to delete my token before uploading the video.

### 💡 セクション 69

Treat your API tokens as passwords. Okay. do not share them publicly. And if you're uploading to GitHub, make sure you create a git ignore file, right? And you include that env ignore so it doesn't get leaked.

### 🔧 セクション 70

And if you want, if you're not sure, you can just do a launch open code or clo say like update the git ignore to cover 20 most likely things in our directory that should not leak to public. You can ask agents to protect you, right? But just don't be irresponsible with this. It's going to analyze the directory and it's going to update the env file. I mean not the ENV file the get ignore right so let's look at it boom we just put env going to structure it much better environment variables and secrets API is credentials scrape data files and see much more detailed and yeah we have a pretty nice git ignore that protects as well so if we needed to throw this up on GitHub we wouldn't leak anything so do not share API keys I was building the minimal web app with filtering format analysis is five.

### 🎯 セクション 71

Okay, so it did it wrote we got 83 tweets. So that's more than 50. It used this scraper tweet. Let's look at it. Tweet scraper v2.

### 💭 セクション 72

This probably one of the more expensive ones because of how difficult it is. Lightning fast jur scraping. I It's not that expensive. Like $0.4,000 ft is uh pretty pretty solid. Let's go back.

### 📌 セクション 73

But actually it's not really accurate. Look at this. 3.3283. So yeah, this pricing on this scraper is uh it's not the most accurate. But hey, here we have the here we have the file.

### ✅ セクション 74

It created the file. Let's look at all tweets. Tweets are not loaded there. Tweets are not loaded there. Swipe file zero.

### 📚 セクション 75

Okay. So I'm going to take a screenshot. Give it to open code. Boom. Um the site is empty.

### 🔖 セクション 76

The data does does not get loaded. Fix this. Providing screenshots is very good for your agents to fix any issues. Always do that. While it's fixing the issue, I also should mention that on the store when you go to actors inside of a console and go to the store, you can deploy your own actor, right?

### 🎨 セクション 77

So, if you are expert scraping or if you if you know some website that has like really good data but doesn't have any appy scrapers, you can develop a new one link, you know, through GitHub or wherever it's deployed and make money when people use it, right? This is the beauty of the Appify store. All of these people who develop their actors, they get paid when others use it. So if you have a really good idea for a scraper, just throw it up on the Appify store and if people use it, you'll make some money. Now let's go back to open code.

### 🚀 セクション 78

Let's see what's happening. Okay, the embedded data isn't loading. I don't know why. Let's reload. While this is going, I'm going to do another open code.

### ⚡ セクション 79

Boom. Throw it up in here. Here I'm going to do model and switch it to kimi k2.5. Here I'll say update the design of index html so that it follows uh midcentury modern design theme. Okay, wait.

### 🌟 セクション 80

It opened in my second window. Look at this. Boom. AI tweet swap file. 20 total tweets.

### 🎬 セクション 81

Average engagement total likes. Let's see. the top offer list. All right, let's see. All tweets.

### 📋 セクション 82

UK labor government is threatening to block X but will say word about GIGBD 67 likes paid courses. Okay. Programming states on math. All right. Interesting.

### ⭐ セクション 83

So 10 is list format. Okay. So list format works really well. Interesting. If you want to perform on Twitter, you should try a list format or a question format.

### 📝 セクション 84

You probably shouldn't do announcements, whole text statements. Sometimes they can work for sure. But again, do this analysis for your own field. If you're marketing on Twitter, it would be very wise to use API to scrape some posts on Twitter and see what's working, see what isn't working. That way, you can upgrade your marketing and social media.

### 💡 セクション 85

See, a lot of people think AI is only useful for building and coding. That's not true. If you that's very limiting, right? That's that's the obvious use case. With tools like Ampify connected to powerful AI agents, you can actually take your marketing to the next level and get more customers, get higher reach, grow your social media with the use of AI agents.

### 🔧 セクション 86

So, if you want to try this yourself, click the first link below the video, try Appify, and begin your journey into the world of web scraping. With that being said, thank you guys for watching, and I wish you a wonderful, productive week. See you.
