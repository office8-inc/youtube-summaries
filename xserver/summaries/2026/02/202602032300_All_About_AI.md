## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

Okay, so today uh I wanted to share something I have been working on for the last few days. I would say like the last week or something and that is kind of taking my dedicated Mac Mini AI agent to yeah do like a full end toend project autonomously. So the goal we're just going to set to the agent is to code up a new project, publish this on GitHub, right? We're going to market it on X and to do that we need to do screen recording, voiceovers, explainers and everything. So you can see all the steps kind of the individual steps of this would be something like we need to brainstorm a new project we're going to do.

### 📋 背景・概要

We're going to write the code. We're going to test all the functions. We're going to write down explainer how this project works or this app maybe. We're going to do a voice over for that explainer. We're going to screen record uh using the app, edit the video, and finally publish this on X or something.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

And the goal is this is going to be 100% autonomous. So the AI agent is going to do everything. So that is kind of the skills I have kind of trained up my agent to do over the last few days and I think it should be able to do this. It would be maybe not the advanced uh application but uh the the idea is that we can see this end to end by just giving this goal here. So, I think we're just going to jump straight over to the Mac Mini and I'm just going to show you how this work in practice and I'm going to talk a bit at the end about how I kind of do this, right?

### 📝 詳細説明

Okay. So, if you didn't watch my previous video, uh basically our agent that is fully dedicated on my Mac Mini has a lot of skills, right? So, these are kind of skills uh I have be kind of training my AI agent on. If you want to see how I do that, check out the previous videos. So uh yeah you can see all the skills here under claude uh skills but if you go to claude itself and we do slash skills [snorts] right you can see the list here.

### 💡 実例・デモ

So we have coding x video research screen recording LinkedIn video editing thumbnails generate image YouTube everything. So I've been just testing a lot of different things and I want to see how far we can push this. So, I think this video kind of will give you kind of idea uh what you can do now. And I think this is kind of maybe there are some people doing more advanced stuff, but uh I haven't really seen anyone else do this. So, I think it's pretty interesting.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

So, what we're going to do now is just give it like an open-ended goal. Uh so, I'm going to come up with a prompt here that just describes what I want to do. And then we're just going to observe the agent doing this. Yeah. From end to end hopefully.

### 🎯 応用例

Okay. Okay. So, I'm just going to read out the prompt I'm going to send here. If it's too long, you can just skip ahead a bit or just pause. So, I want you to brainstorm a new coding project with a UI that is relevant to a hot topic.

### 💭 考察

Maybe something to do with markdown files. Do research on X. Find something what people care about and make it simple but working. Do testing to see how it works. Uh when it works locally, create a new GitHub repo.

### 📌 まとめ

Push the project. Then uh we need to create an explainer video of the project where you talk about the functions how they work. Screen record you doing this. Edit the video for publishing on X. Include a GitHub link in uh X post.

### ✅ 結論

Read all your skills before starting. Good luck. So that is everything I'm going to do. This is a bit more uh specific than just an open goal. But uh yeah, I think we're just going to do this.

### 📚 追加情報

So yeah, hopefully that is it. That is all I'm going to do. So we're going to just observe now. So, of course, this is going to take some time. I don't know how long because I haven't really tried it end to end yet.

### 🔖 補足

So, this is kind of new for me, too. But, um, I think maybe we're just going to start doing this like like I I did in the intro video. It's just going to be creating this plan here or this checkpoints, right? You can see research hot topic, building coding project, push to GitHub, uh, create edit explainer video, post on. Yeah, you you get the point, right?

### 🎨 セクション 13

So you can see we go straight to X. We search for markdown editor. And yeah, you can see it's just going to do research like we told it to do. And I guess it's just going to keep scrolling on X here. It's searching for claude.md.

### 🚀 セクション 14

Okay. So I guess people are talking about cloud code and stuff on X. So that is probably why it's doing that. And you can see everything I kind of train this skill on is that it has everything the tools it needs to navigate X. It can grab contacts from X and everything.

### ⚡ セクション 15

Now it's searched for readme generator markdown preview and it's just doing like we said just a bunch of research. So I'm just going to let it uh continue with this and I'll take you back. Okay, so you can see that was done. Now it closed all the tabs and what was the next part? I [clears throat] guess it was start coding.

### 🌟 セクション 16

I don't know what the ID is now. Uh but I'm going to open up this here and you can see I'm not in dangerously skip permissions mode. So, I think I'm going to go out and set it in uh this mode here now. So, I should have done this from the beginning because I want to do this in dangerously skip permissions just to save me some time so I don't have to to um uh stop every time. So, I'm just going to say continue.

### 🎬 セクション 17

So, now you can see I skipped to just skip permissions. So, yeah, we can see we have our little list here. So, we're going to build a coding UI for a project, push it to GitHub, create an uh edit explainer video, and post it on X with a GitHub link. Yeah. So, that was what we was talking about.

### 📋 セクション 18

So, the next part now is just going to start building out the code, I guess. So, again, I'm just going to let this run and yeah, probably just speed this up a bit to see where we end up here. Okay, so now it's going to test the project. So, you can see we have the claw.md editor. So, I don't know exactly what kind of project this is, but uh we kind of spun up the UI here.

### ⭐ セクション 19

Start writing your claw MD here. And then you have a preview. I'm not exactly sure what it's supposed to do here, but uh that doesn't really matter. So, yeah, you can see it uh put in some code, some uh this is a test of the Claude MD editor. We have live preview dark light team uh and we get it in this format.

### 📝 セクション 20

Yeah, maybe not the most interesting project but that is not the idea. The idea is to see if the agent can do this from end to end autonomously, right? That is the idea. Yeah, we are still testing. You can see we have an issue here.

### 💡 セクション 21

The CSS variable uh light team. So, it's just going to do testing on the application now just to see if all the functionalities work. So I think it's trying to test uh if the light mode is working now because we have dark and light mode. So you can see yeah there it switched. So we kind of fix the light mode.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So that is pretty good. Now we have both dark mode and light mode for the app. Uh okay that's fine. Let's see if it has any other things it wants to test here. Okay.

### 🎯 セクション 23

So it says everything works. It's fully functional. So now we going to Yeah, probably just push this to GitHub. Yeah, it's pushing this to GitHub and it's uh yeah, it can also navigate the browser. So, uh I gave it a skill so it can go to github.com, log into its account and just create the repo and everything from here.

### 💭 セクション 24

It doesn't really have to have the API or like the yeah the setup. It can do it from the browser as long as we are kind of logged in here. So now it's probably just going to push in like the repository name, the description. Yeah, you can see it's doing that. Now, this is not me, right?

### 📌 セクション 25

Uh, cloud MD editor. It's going to click on continue. And now we kind of have this setup. And now it's just probably going to do some commands here. And that should be it.

### ✅ セクション 26

And we should have this project on GitHub now. Yeah, it's pushing this to the main now. And yeah, that should be probably it. Yeah, you can see in the back here we got the Claude MD editor. Perfect.

### 📚 セクション 27

Uh now come kind of the tricky part and that is kind of starting to create a video. How we going to explain how this project worked? Because we here we have kind of speech to or text to speech. We're going to do some voices and we're going to do screen recording and everything. I'm not 100% sure how well that's going to work out, but we'll see.

### 🔖 セクション 28

So yeah, I'm not going to interrupt here now because if it's doing screen recording, then I guess uh I can't really put up the claw editor here. So I'm just going to wait this out and of course we can watch the screen recording after. Okay, so it did put in like a browser agent CLI tool that lets clo interact with Chrome tabs. And basically all it did uh it converted this to markdown. Now it switched to light mode and you can probably click download and clear.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Uh it's a very simple application but uh that was not the idea. Uh the idea is to see if we can do this end to end right. So hopefully it's doing some screen recording now and this is going to be part of the video. Okay. So it looks like it's done with the video now.

### 🚀 セクション 30

Uh I think it saved it somewhere. So now it's going to try to do some kind of TTS here. Voice over. Okay. Uh because we wanted like a voice over to explain how the the app worked before we push uh push this onto X, right as a post.

### ⚡ セクション 31

Voice over generated. Now it's going to combine that with our screen recording video. Okay. Is this going to be any good? I'm not sure, but it's a cool project, I think.

### 🌟 セクション 32

And it's super interesting. I can see we have the demo.mpp3 here. So now it's just using ffmpeg to combine this into like the video. We're going to publish on X. Okay.

### 🎬 セクション 33

So, we go to X. We click on compose. And now it's probably just going to inject the video here using your JavaScript. Yes, 40 second long video. You can see this is kind of processing now in the background.

### 📋 セクション 34

Uh, let's just move this out of the way a bit. And you can see, yeah, we are waiting for this to upload. And remember, we said we're going to add some text and the GitHub link. And when this is done now, we're going to check it out. I don't know how good this is going to be, but uh yeah, I'm might just Doesn't really matter anyway.

### ⭐ セクション 35

But so far, I've been super happy. You can see how fast it was to I think we only spent like how how much time have we spent? Maybe like 10 15 minutes or something. So, the video is uploaded. Now, we're going to type the text.

### 📝 セクション 36

Okay. Again, we're using some CDP injections here. built a simple cloud end editor with live preview and we leave the link. Yes, that's good. And basically all we have to do now is post it.

### 💡 セクション 37

And after we done that, we're going to pick it up and we're going to watch the video. I don't think this is going to be too good, but it's pretty cool anyway. Right. Okay. So, we made a post and that should be the end, right?

### 🔧 セクション 38

Because now we have done all the steps we wanted here. Yeah. We go to our page. You can see it's live. And yeah, that should be it.

### 🎯 セクション 39

We updated our memory. And that should be it. So now let's take a look at it. Yeah, I think this is going to be pretty bad, but let's do it anyway. Okay, let's play it.

### 💭 セクション 40

So I built a simple tool for writing claw MD files. It's a live markdown editor with a split view. On the left, you write your markdown. On the right, you see the preview instantly. No lag, no refresh needed.

### 📌 セクション 41

It tracks your word count, character count, and line count in real time. Super useful when you're trying to keep your claw.md concise. You can toggle between dark and light things. I prefer dark mode, but some people like light for readability. And when you're done, just hit download and it saves as claw.md.

### ✅ セクション 42

Your content also autosaves to local storage, so you won't lose your work if you close the tab. It's just one HTML file. No dependencies, no build step. >> I got to say that was pretty good, right? I I was kind of surprised here how well it did.

### 📚 セクション 43

Right. Yeah. I think I kind of like this. So again, I think this is just kind of the beginning of what we can do with this. Right.

### 🔖 セクション 44

So this was not maybe not uh the most advanced task, but I have done things that are much more advanced with this with great success. It even kind of my agent also runs like a couple of YouTube channels now. It's just doing a bunch of different stuff for me. And like I said, this is like a dedicated agent, so I'm not kind of worried about anything personal on the computer. And the agent has all of these uh loginins that is just it's not me, right?

### 🎨 セクション 45

It's not my personal things. So again, I'm super impressed and I'm going to keep working on this. So if you want to kind of see more how our agents going to involved in the next few weeks, months, just give this video a like and a sub and I will keep you updated. Uh and I'll tell you, I have done much more interesting thing than this that I'm going to keep you up to speed on and I'm going to do some videos on it and I'm going to do more explainers how you can do this yourself like training like I did in the previous video. So yeah, hope this gave you some cool ideas what we actually can start doing now with these systems.

### 🚀 セクション 46

So yeah, I've been super inspired lately and I hope you are too. So yeah, thank you for tuning in today.
