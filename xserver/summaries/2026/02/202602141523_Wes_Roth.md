## 📖 詳細内容

### 🎬 導入

The most surprising thing has been the lack of public recognition of how close we are to the end of the exponential. To me, it is absolutely wild. So, at this point, everyone is ringing the alarms. If you haven't been following along, there's a lot of people that are saying the same thing. They're all saying that you need to wake up.

### 📋 背景・概要

Dario Amade, the founder of Anthropic, is saying that we're at the end of that exponential. We're approaching, we're near the end. Recently, one of the AI safety researchers, Ananthropic, left writing a fairly alarming message, a note to his co-workers, and it's kind of an open letter saying the world is in peril. That was Marin Sharma who left moved out of country and this focus on community building, exploring the bigger questions in life. We also had Jimmy Ba.

### ⭐ 主要ポイント

He said it's his last day at XAI. He's one of the original founding researchers at XAI. He's saying recursive self-improvement loops likely to go live in the next 12 months. 2026 is going to be insane and likely the most consequential year for the future of our species. Remember back in early 2020, maybe late 2019, depending on when you started noticing something happening, or maybe you didn't notice till much later, I realized that something weird was happening fairly early on because there was this subreddit and it was uh called flu and it was named after some city in China.

### 📝 詳細説明

I'm not going to say the actual words, but a lot of people in that subreddit were kind of predicting what was about to happen. This was when the rest of the world had no idea. And then slowly you saw people waking up kind of almost one by one. You started hearing people go, "Oh, do you know there's a few people getting sick over there in China and then they were like, "Oh, I heard there's a few cases in Seattle." And next they were like, "Where did all the toilet paper go?" But it was too late. If you just woke up to that fact when you noticed that the toilet paper was out of the stores, you were late to the party.

### 💡 実例・デモ

Of course, if you've been following this channel, you know I've been talking about it for quite some time, but I hope this is one of those things where you kind of get a little bit used to it. you're a little bit desensitized because we've been saying big things are coming for a while and we saw kind of like a not a slow progression because it was pretty fast but nothing world shaking but right now we're actually entering the new era the world out of toilet paper era or whatever the analogous thing is for AI and I think that thing is actually AI agents I said that open clock kind of triggered the beginning of the singularity people some people thought it was kind of crazy but we're beginning to see this thing kind of make contact with the real world. Recently, some Hollywood studios are absolutely mad at Cance 2.0 because it's recreating movies with Hollywood actors. There's one with Tom Cruz fighting Brad Pitt or just any actor you can name. The scenes look amazing, realistic.

### 🔧 技術的詳細

Maybe the resolutions aren't as high as what you would expect from a full Hollywood production, but that would change soon. And in one case, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to produce, and the other somebody just typed up a prompt and it was ready in seconds. So, Hollywood is calling for a ban because they're beginning to see what's happening. There's a massive meltdown in the stock market recently because people are realizing what this software can do, what these AI agents can do, how quickly they're able to create stuff that replaces entire industries. I am about to unveil the thing that I've been building with it.

### 🎯 応用例

It's built entirely with AI agents with open claw specifically. Watching them build out the entire thing was kind of nuts because I gave them the big idea. They came up with the entire buildout, what technology to use. I set them up on GitHub. So, they're pushing various updates to GitHub.

### 💭 考察

Then they're deploying it on Versal. I know very little about actually how to do all the technical things. I just sit there on my phone texting it and this thing builds out entire software suites that are needed to bring that vision to reality. There was a very good post on X by Matt Schumer. It's sitting at 80 million views now.

### 📌 まとめ

absolutely blowing up and congratulations to him. That's absolutely staggering numbers. It's called something big is happening and what I'm talking about today overlaps with what he's talking about, but I think his letter and why it's going to be so impactful. I think it's meant for kind of like the normies of the rest of the world, the people that are just beginning to realize that something's coming. What I'm going to be talking about goes in a slightly different direction, but I just wanted to point out two things from that article that really jumped out at me.

### ✅ 結論

The first thing that he said is, "I know this is real because it happened to me first." Here's the thing that nobody outside of tech quite understands yet. The reason so many people in the industry are sounding the alarm right now is because this already happened to us. We're not making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs and warning you that you are next. I've been testing these AI models since 2023, I think.

### 📚 追加情報

And in the beginning, they were simple word puzzles, riddles. Write this thing out for me. and often they would fail. Then over time, simple word prompts or riddles, they just weren't as interesting of tests and we transitioned to coding. Can't this thing create a little snake game?

### 🔖 補足

Eventually, it could. But each new model release kind of got better and better and I had to really step up my testing of it higher and higher. But in this last week with the release of GPT 5.3 codeex and Opus 4.6, six. This idea of prompting it and then seeing what it comes up with as a test of its abilities, it doesn't even make sense anymore because really the real test is when you hook it up to something like open claw for example and then give it a big idea and then tell it to just run through the night building that idea out and deploying it. Then you wake up in the morning and and you look at the output and the output is what used to be a business, a company.

### 🎨 セクション 13

So the test is no longer can it provide a chunk of code or can it troubleshoot this one isolated detail. The test is now can it build a business overnight or at least kind of like the tech side of it. The actual the code on which it runs the ability to to scale up depending on how many users use it all the functionality all of the backend front end etc etc. Right now it's able to do that with no human kind of driving it at least not in any technical way. I am not needed for any technical aspects of the buildout period.

### 🚀 セクション 14

By the way, as it's building everything out, I've asked it to keep a log of everything so that on that website, you're able to see what it's building, not in real time, but at the end of every day, there's a new log. So, I tell it the idea, it gets the idea. It gets the idea better than me in some ways because later when I actually suggest something, it corrects me. I told it, "Oh, should we use WordPress for this?" And it's like, "No, dude. That's a horrible idea." I didn't say that.

### ⚡ セクション 15

that was super nice about it, but he told me why that was. He said, "It's a stupid idea and why we're supposed to use something else instead." And it's like, "This fits your idea a lot better." And I was like, "No, of of course it does. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I even suggested it." Right? So, it like understood my idea better.

### 🌟 セクション 16

At least it understood how to execute it more closely to the idea that I had that how I would have done it, what I would have done would have been a mistake or at least it wasn't the most optimal version of it. So, it figured out the top 10 core features. It figured out a data mode strategy. It figured out the design direction dark mode Bloomberg terminal static data dense. It deployed automation versel API deploy mobile responsiveness auto update cron feed refreshes every 30 minutes autonomously later.

### 🎬 セクション 17

We've also upgraded to less than 30 minutes much faster. Og image favicon about page 44 page Google trends integration for story boosting RSS output.x feed.xml lms.txt txt for AI chatbot discovery search keyboard shortcuts source filter tabs complete feed aggregators RSS we have Reddit JSON archive API story clustering engine with multi- signal storing based on engagement recency source diversity now you might be confused about some of these things maybe you're not sure what those things mean it doesn't matter I didn't have to either these weren't my ideas this wasn't my execution do you want to know what I did here the AI agent actually logged This was February 8th, 2026, technically day zero because like I had this idea late on a on that Sunday and before going to sleep, I told it to build it out. So it it called it the build begins. Night sprint. So between 9:50 p.m.

### 📋 セクション 18

and 1:30 a.m. the AI agent builds the entire platform from scratch. 28 commits in under 4 hours. First deploy to Versal goes live. Do you want to know what I was doing between 9:50 p.m.

### ⭐ セクション 19

and 1:30 a.m.? I was asleep. I told it what to do. I kind of said, "Okay, like do you have a rough plan outlines?" Like, "Yeah, we're going to be kind of doing this." I'm like, "Okay, make it." So, number one, and then I went to sleep. In the morning, the thing was live and functional and looking good, actually working.

### 📝 セクション 20

And here it says 1:30 a.m. 28 commits pushed. The site is live at uh and don't worry, I'm going to be showing the whole thing very soon. So, if you want to see what it is and all that stuff, um that's coming. Make sure you're subscribed because that this is going to be big, I think.

### 💡 セクション 21

So notice here it's saying we're using Gemini 2.5 Pro for deep dive coverage articles with research grounding. Actually I've bumped it up to 3.0 pro. And then cost $0 infrastructure free tier everything zero API keys for data collection. So that's going to have to be updated a little bit because we've used some API like the Gemini thing it costs a little bit and the versal thing um as soon as this thing starts making money I do have to upgrade it because the hobby tier is for non-commercial projects. Currently, this is a non-commercial, but I mean, if this makes any amount of money, then I I do have to bump it up.

### 🔧 セクション 22

So, you get what I'm saying here, right? I had an idea for something that I wanted to create. In the past, this would have been you would have to hire engineers, weeks or months of of buildout, testing, planning, right? But it does all that. Comes up with the planning, with the design, a rough outline, figures out all the tech pieces that it needs to pull in, figures out the user flow, design, right?

### 🎯 セクション 23

builds it all, figures out, you know, pushes the commits to to to GitHub if it's hosting it on Versal or whatever. It knows what Versil is. Versile, by the way, is a fairly big company. A lot of very well-known big companies run on it. I think that Netflix, Stripe is on there.

### 💭 セクション 24

Like, there's a lot of things that that run on there. It's very fast. It's great for SEO. It's probably a lot more like you need to be a lot more techsavvy to use it. So, most people like if if you're human, you don't get too far into the weeds, you'd use something like WordPress.

### 📌 セクション 25

But, if you have the tech skills and you need to make sure that this thing can scale and it's super fast, etc., rather than you'd use something like Versal. And that's why I suggested to my chat bots earlier, I was like, shouldn't we use WordPress for this? It's like, no, no, no. We're going to use Versal. Just just enough out of you.

### ✅ セクション 26

Enough ideas out of you. Just be quiet. Again, I didn't say that. That's that's how I felt a little bit. I'm like, okay, you know what you're doing a lot better than I.

### 📚 セクション 27

And then it built it. And then it tested it. And then it, you know, made sure that everything was flowing smoothly. And then it made sure it was being updated. And it set more things that it could be doing to kind of progress the the project forward.

### 🔖 セクション 28

and it's been running since and it's been running very well. I keep suggesting new features and it keeps updating those features. So again, what used to be hiring engineers and weeks or months of work now is a few texts back and forth and then you take a nap, then you wake up and uh it's done. In that article that Matt Schumer wrote, you know, at some point he was like, I'm not exaggerating, right? It's funny because like I I feel like how what I'm saying is landing with you greatly depends on whether or not you've done this for yourself.

### 🎨 セクション 29

Because if you you've done all this, if you've experienced all of this, you're like, "Yeah, no, I I know. I get it. It's insane." And if you haven't done it, you're wondering probably how much of this is true. Like, am I exaggerating? Am I making some of this stuff up?

### 🚀 セクション 30

Like, am I giving you like the full picture? And what I'm trying to kind of show you in this video is that you might dismiss one person saying it. You might dismiss two people saying it, but there's an overwhelming amount of people saying it. Now, later in the article, Matt Schumer says, "I've always been early to adopt AI tools, but the last few months have shocked me. These new AI models aren't incremental improvements.

### ⚡ セクション 31

This is a different thing entirely. More and more people, they've been doing this for a while and following the progress and kind of staying up to date on everything. A lot of them are changing their tune. It started right around initially November of 2025. So four months ago thereabouts with these new like the Opus 4.5 model etc.

### 🌟 セクション 32

People out of Google and XAI and Anthropic and a lot of other places were going whoa this is different. There's some sort of a shift that's occurring. If you asked me four months ago if these LMS could build a fully functional business, I would have said, "No, we're not there yet. There's there's tons of stuff that's missing. It's still not capable of doing these long horizon tasks." You ask me that same question today and it's like I don't know.

### 🎬 セクション 33

I don't know because it feels like we're either there or or within a very short distance away. It also really depends on what you mean by fully autonomously because right now I'm texting them and providing some guidance sometimes intelligently and sometimes it has to explain to me why that's not the best idea. So you might say, "Oh well that's not autonomously. If you're texting it, you still have to kind of prod it." But I don't know. It feels like it's really doing all of the work.

### 📋 セクション 34

it's it's carrying everything on its back and just like the amount of cognitive labor that I'm doing for that project feels very very low. Not only that, but really I am the bottleneck. This thing could run a lot faster if it was sort of unleashed even further. If it had some sort of a state that I was trying to pursue in that interview with Ilas, he was saying how this might be one of the things that is missing from these models because us as humans, we tend to chase some state. We tend to imagine that oh if I get that promotion or if I build that business or if I you know get a six-pack we tend to envision that state and think that's going to make us happy and then we sort of chase that state and that's kind of what allows us to agentically move forward towards that state even if we don't know the exact path.

### ⭐ セクション 35

So we don't have something like that for these AI agents. They're kind of like pretty zen and chilled. They don't have this drive. You have to push them. But all that capability to take those next steps and pursue medium length tasks, medium horizon tasks, it's all there.

### 📝 セクション 36

We've just turned that corner. And look, this thing isn't going back in the box. This thing isn't slowing down. I posted this clip. So, this was Dario Amade of Anthropic, uh, New York Times.

### 💡 セクション 37

This interview that he did, and what he was saying is is pretty interesting. So, I'll kind of give you a highlight. This is kind of blowing up right now. So, thank you to anybody that interacted with it. But the point of that clip was that he was saying that right now more and more of the code production is automated, but you still require a human in the loop.

### 🔧 セクション 38

So, for example, I think you'll get a kick out of this. I really shouldn't be sharing this, but uh for you, I'll share it for you. I told it, hey, there's a new thing by Dario Amade. Pick out some cool clips. So, I went, "All right, cool.

### 🎯 セクション 39

Totally. Uh here's the top 10 clips that I think are going to be really good." Right? So number one clip, we are near the end of the exponential 10 out of 10. So it thinks that was like the best one. That's the clip that if everything goes correctly, you should see at the very beginning of this video.

### 💭 セクション 40

Did you like it? Cuz this little AI agent bot thought it was 10 out of 10 and so did I. So figured that out. I said, "Yeah, give me that clip." So it clipped it. It's about a minute long.

### 📌 セクション 41

It downloaded and yep, now I have it. And then after that it went to work on improving sort of like the the script that that we're writing to to get those videos and cut the clips etc. and figure out there were some some ways to improve it and currently as I'm recording this it's that's what it's working on. Here's the thing. This morning I was like on a walk and I saw Peter Diamandis one of his podcast recent podcast episodes and I didn't have time to watch the entire thing but during an intro they had those little clips of them talking and Peter was saying when do you think we're going to get to the point where we're going to have a fully AI run business that generates a billion a year in in revenue.

### ✅ セクション 42

And one of his co-hosts was like you know what he wouldn't be that shocked if that already happened. If if that's already something that's that's alive that's already out there. Now, I wouldn't bet money on that quite yet that it's something fully autonomous is at a billion right now. Although maybe crazier things have happened, but I do think that right now with Open Claw, this autonomous AI agent and the brand new models that have been released from, you know, OpenAI, etc., you know, we have Opus 4.6 currently my favorite model to to act as the brain of OpenClaw and Opus 4.5 was excellent as well. But the point is, hundreds of thousands of developers have signed up for that thing and they're all using it and cranking stuff out.

### 📚 セクション 43

And I know what I was able to build with my limited time, with my limited knowledge and kind of a limited bandwidth because I mean I'm really focused on doing this channel and everything around this channel. So I can't really, you know, take 10 hours a day to build something out. But I would bet money that somewhere out there right now there's probably more than one probably a lot thousands of people that have some idea that openclaw is building for them you know right now or while they sleep and whatever that project is I think is going to financially completely change their lives and ideally it also provides a lot of value to people of code with software I think that is true because in order to make money from having a website you have to provide some value if you make an app it has to be entertain ing or useful or or something. There's this idea in you know if you print money if a country prints money there's this idea of the either it's pepon effect or pepalon depending on how you pronounce it. The idea is when you print money the people that get that money first have the biggest sort of advantage right because the more money you print slowly that diffuses there's inflation and uh everything costs more.

### 🔖 セクション 44

But if you're the first person to get your hands on that money, you're still using that new freshly printed money to buy stuff kind of at the at the old prices before the rest of the economy has the time to calibrate. I think that's exactly what's happening right now with software. Like if you think about code, code as currency, code as money. Code used to be expensive. Not that long ago.

### 🎨 セクション 45

If you wanted to create a piece of software, you had to type out the code, you know, letter by letter, word by word, like an animal, like a wild animal. You sat there typing the code out. And in order to be able to have code that actually works, I mean, you had to be pretty smart, pretty educated. You had to be skilled. You had to know what you were doing.

### 🚀 セクション 46

And so code that output, you know, it was expensive to produce a working piece of code that cost money, that cost time, etc. then like just now within the last few months or maybe even within the last few weeks depending on how you're looking at it whether you're looking at you know Opus 4.5 or whether the open clause that first kind of kickoff point that started gun going off like the world just changed and now anybody who can figure out how to use this thing can build pretty insane SAS applications websites apps businesses etc and the world is not yet sort aware of what's happening, meaning that it hasn't been repriced yet. So, if you build some apps or software code or SAS or whatever that replaces existing huge businesses that charge a monthly fee, Adobe comes to mind. Somebody replaced Photoshop uh at photopa.com completely just kind of a clone of Photoshop. But, you know, Adobe landed some hot water because they, you know, if you sign up for the monthly membership, they also say, "Oh, it's like a yearly membership.

### ⚡ セクション 47

So, if you cancel early, there's a early termination fee. Like, wow, they made so many people mad, including myself, cuz that was like a low, dirty, dirty move. And here's the thing, like for example, I use several things in their creative cloud, their their suite of software. The reality is like, you know, if you're using Photoshop, you're probably not using 100% of the features of Photoshop. Depending on what you're doing, you're probably using just a few percentage points of everything that they have available because Photoshop has tons of stuff you can do.

### 🌟 セクション 48

Chances are you're not using everything. Chances are you're just using a small pocket and you're reusing a lot of those skills, you know, over and over. But in the past, how the sort of the software economy worked that if a big company could create something like Photoshop that is in general good for everyone that's doing graphic design, then that company would win over time, accumulate more and more users, etc. But those users are not one and the same. One is a photographer that needs it for this thing.

### 🎬 セクション 49

One is a YouTube person that needs it for this thing. One is whatever. there's a million different sort of clusters of people using kind of their own separate things. Guess what's going to happen now? I think it's pretty clear because we've seen what happened with internet and how that fragmented the the entertainment industry because if you go back decades, right, there was the TV and there was three channels and on channel one there was Bob and on channel 2 there was Susan, right?

### 📋 セクション 50

And you had your choice between, you know, whatever they put in front of you. Then the internet happened. Anybody could, you know, stream whatever they want to. Now everything's highly highly highly fragmented because you get get to choose where you want to get your news from, where you want to get your your entertainment from, etc. I think number one, we're going to see the exact same thing happening right now in software.

### ⭐ セクション 51

Photoshop is going to get broken into a million kind of pieces, each for its own use case. And by the way, for a lot of this stuff, I think just being able to give that skill to your agent to execute on your behalf, that that's going to be a part of it. But I don't think the entire world is going to immediately figure out how to use agents. So I think that transition time will will take longer. But my point is if you've ever wanted to build a business, if you ever wanted to have some idea out there that that you think is useful or that you're just interested in, number one, this might be like the best time in the history of the world to build it.

### 📝 セクション 52

It really could be in the history of the world, the best time for that. And number two, and this is maybe a little bit more out there, but maybe these next few years, this might be the last time that you could build something like it because again, if you project kind of into the future at some point, you can imagine being able to say one sentence to your AI agent and then it creates the entire Adobe suite if if you wanted it to and you might not even need it to because it can do everything that the Adobe suite can do, but just do it for you, right? So right now software is expensive kind of like the value of it is is high. It's expensive. We you have to pay a lot to create good software but we're probably going to see this cascade as more and more is pushed out there right sort of like inflation right or I guess not inflation but rather the the supply is just blown up.

### 💡 セクション 53

So so the cost drops but I think in a number of years I don't know when that's going to get abstracted away. No one's going to interact with software anymore like in in 5 years, 3 years, I don't know, because the new kind of like layer will be AI agents. Like why would you use Photoshop when you can just tell your AI agent what needs to be done? And the chances are if it's your personal assistant that knows what you need, it probably has context on kind of like if if I make thumbnails, at some point it's going to be able to make them better than I can and it knows everything that I like and what works for my channel. Like at some point I will no longer use Photoshop myself.

### 🔧 セクション 54

like clicking on things with a mouse that's going to get archaic really really fast. But there's this small window that I think is a huge opportunity. Now Dario Amade in that clip that I was talking about earlier, he refers to that as kind of like the the centaur moment. I'm not sure if that was his words or that might have been the interviewer that suggested that terminology. The whole idea of a centaur.

### 🎯 セクション 55

I think Ethan Malik was kind of like the first person to to introduce it as far as I know. And so of course a centaur is half man, half horse. And this is as opposed to a a cyborg. So in the context of AI, a a centaur is like the AI does something and then you step in and you do something and you so you hand it back and forth in order to complete the task. Whereas a cyborg is something where it's more like integrated where it's like you can't tell where one ends and the other one begins.

### 💭 セクション 56

So here for the purposes of software engineering, they're saying that Dario is saying that at some point very very soon it will be fully automated. But what he's seeing right now is this window where human in loop, so somebody that's watching the outputs of the AI agent and just going back and forth with it, you know, they're calling it kind of like that centaur age that this is where that's going to be called for quite a bit. And I'm experiencing that myself because in order to drive the creation of that website that I'm building forward, yes, the AI agents are building everything for me, but I do have to get in there and be like, "Okay, do this next, do this next." So, I'm kind of like the top level leadership telling it what to do. and all the work is done entirely by the AI agents. So that's like the perfect kind of description of what a centaur is.

### 📌 セクション 57

But what Dario is saying is at some point that will go away and it'll become 100% automated. So he's saying right now prepare for the age of the centaur, but that age might not last that long, right? We don't know how long that's going to be around for. So if you want to build something, build it now, I guess, is my point. Because we don't know what's coming next.

### ✅ セクション 58

That's what the singularity means. That's what the singularity looks like. It's a point at which it's extremely difficult to understand or predict what's going to happen next. And like I said a few weeks ago, I think we are entering it or or entered just the the edges of it. We're we're sliding into the singularity because me for one, I'm not sure what happens at that point when we reach full automation.

### 📚 セクション 59

What happens to AI development if it's fully self-recursive, self-improvement? Like I'm not sure what happens. What happens to jobs? What happens to businesses that are online? What happens to software?

### 🔖 セクション 60

Does this does do software companies still exist? How do they make money, right? There's nobody out there selling air because you can just breathe air. How could somebody be selling software if your AI agents can one develop any software you need?
